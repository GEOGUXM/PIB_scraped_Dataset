    In view of increase in the power requirement in State of Jammu & Kashmir, that happens normally during winter, the Central Government has allocated 74% power i.e. 792MW out of 1071 MW from the unallocated power pool of Northern region. This will help J&K in further meeting the additional requirement of power during the winter.


    The power requirement in the State is met from the generation from their own power plants, allocated share from central generating stations and power purchased from market. The peak demand of J&K during the current year (April to October, 2017) was 2,768 MW and the demand met was 2214 MW, thus, leaving shortfall of around 554 MW (i.e 20%). At present, around 70% of the energy requirement is being met from Central Generating Stations in the State.


    The allocation of power to J&K from Central Generating Stations (CGS) is 2,397 MW. The supply from CGS includes power stations of NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, NPCIL, NLC, etc. In addition to this, power is also available for reallocation from some of the Central Generating Stations, namely, 726 MW from APCPL Jhajjar, 1011 MW from Barh STPP, 220 MW from Farakka STPS stage III, 424 MW from Mauda STPS, 735 MW from Dadri stage II etc. J&K can avail more power from these stations.
