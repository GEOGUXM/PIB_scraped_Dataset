    A Memorandum of Understanding has been signed in presence of Union Minister of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo between Department of Heavy Industries and Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur for setting up of a Centre of Excellence in Advanced Manufacturing Technologies, here today. The agreement sealed by Shri N Sivanand, Joint Secretary of the Department of Heavy Industries (DHI) and Prof Partha P Chakrabarti, Director of IIT Kharagpur focuses on development of a centre to make Indian Capital Goods globally competitive and support the need to increase knowledge of manufacturing through innovation and advanced technology mainly in four important areas, namely, Speciality materials, Process Automation, Additive manufacturing and Digital interventions including Industrial Internet of Things. This centre of excellence has received PPP funding of Rs 65.19 crores of which Rs 47.62 crores is a grant from Department of Heavy Industries, while the rest of the amount has been received from consortium of industries.


    Speaking on the occasion, Shri Babul Supriyo stated, this centre of excellence will fulfil the need for state-of-the-art institute on advanced manufacturing technologies in West Bengal and eastern India that can provide technological knowhow to small and medium scale industries in this part of the country. He mentioned, apart from Research and Development, an ‘X’ factor which stands for ‘execution’ is needed for industry to prosper and that this initiative which brings together academia, corporate houses and enterprises in a synergistic way will lead to a perfect synchronisation. He also mentioned that he envisioned such a centre in West Bengal, the part of the country where he belongs and also represents, after going through a parliamentary question raised on this issue.


    Prof Partha P. Chakraborty, Director, IIT Kharagpur stated, the agreement for setting up of the Centre of Excellence is a first-of-its-kind in the country where the partnering industries are to pay annual fees and not funds for particular projects, thereby ensuring sustainability of this unique PPP model beyond the period of DHI support.


    The delegates present on the occasion included members of partnering industries, senior officials of the Department of Heavy Industries, Academicians and senior administrators of IIT Kharagpur.
