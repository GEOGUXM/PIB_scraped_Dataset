    Shri K. J. Alphons, Minister of State (Independent charge) for Tourism expressed deep concern at the tragic death of 21 tourists in a boat mishap in the Krishna river in Andhra Pradesh.


    In a letter to the Chief Ministers of all the States and Lt. Governors/Administrators of the Union Territories, the Minister expressed his astonishment at the fact that the boat in which the tourist were ferried had no license and the boat was overcrowded beyond the capacity and had no security equipments like life jackets, etc on board, which is gross violation of basic stipulations.


    He has requested the Chief Ministers of the States and Lt. Governors/Administrators of the UTs to put in place a protocol so that in future such incidents do not take place.
