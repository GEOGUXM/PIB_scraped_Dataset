      IFFI 2017 hosts their annual showcasing of a special curated selection of 7 award winning films, namely Panfilovâ€™s 28,The Second Mother,The Heart of Madness, Ayanda, Soulmate, Kaasav and Where has the Time Gone as part of the BRICS Film package.

        The award winning films will be screened through the course of the festival as was done for the first time at the last IFFI.


        Among the films being showcased is the much talked about anthology film "Where Has Time Gone?" headlining directors such as Walter Salles, Alexey Fedorchenko, Madhur Bhandarkar, Jahmil X.T. Qubeka and Jia Zhangke, which was also presented at the Busan International Film Festival.


        Filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar, who represented India at BRICS, today spoke at the press conference today about the BRICS filmmaking programme, the anthology film and his experience at China, the country that hosted BRICS this year.


        Madhur Bhandarkar said, "It was an honour to be in the company of such fine filmmakers, whom I really admire for so many years. It's also an honour to be attached to "Where Has Time Gone" and to represent the country on such an esteemed platform. It was a great moment for me that the film received so much appreciation when we screened it at Busan and a day before in Goa." Adding that, " It's challenging to make a short film and convey a message in 17 minutes. It was such a great experience working on this film and meeting filmmakers from across the world, who brought their own flavour to the film".


        The 48 th Edition of IFFI will take place from the 20 th to 28 th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa.
