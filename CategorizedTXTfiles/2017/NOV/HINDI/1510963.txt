    HH Pramukh Swami Maharaj’s rich thoughts continue to guide people, transcending all barriers. We are always motivated by his vision to transform lives of the needy, poor and marginalised.


    My relation with HH Pramukh Swami Maharaj was a special one. The time I spent with him was memorable. I am fortunate to have been blessed by him. Here is what I had spoken about him in Sarangpur last year. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azaYIrMsx5g “, the Prime Minister said.
