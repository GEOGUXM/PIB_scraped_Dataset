    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, visited Guru Ghasidas Jaitkham and attended the bhoomi pujan for a Saamudayik Bhavan at Girodhpuri in Chhattisgarh today (November 6, 2017).


    Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Guru Ghasidas was a remarkable social reformer among the dispersed community of this region almost 200 years ago. He struggled against social evils and injustice, and fought for the poor and downtrodden. His message was simple: that truth and noble conduct are synonyms for God. He made efforts to eliminate the practice of untouchability, and emphasised fraternity and social harmony. He also stressed women’s rights and supported widow marriage.


    The President said that the teachings of Guru Ghasidas have given direction to social reform among not only the Satnami Samaj but in entire Chhattisgarh. He expressed confidence that by imbibing the ideals of Guru Ghasidas, the people and government of Chhattisgarh would continue to work to build a society based on equality and unity.
