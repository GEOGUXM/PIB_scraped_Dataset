      Posted On: 06 NOV 2017 4:51PM by PIB Delhi


    Airports Authority of India has replaced the existing Instrument Landing System (ILS) for runway 07 at Chennai International airport at a cost of Rs. 5.0 Crores. ILS provides the necessary guidance to pilots as they approach for landing at the runway. The new ILS will facilitate smooth landing of the aircrafts at Chennai Airport even during rain, low clouds, smog etc. and provide an improved guidance to the Aircrafts.


    The new system uses a highly directional antenna system - “Wide Aperture Log Periodic Antenna Array [LPDA]” system. This antenna system has addressed the coverage restrictions of the old ILS, and will provide guidance to the aircraft to a much lower height and improved precision. This is turn will enhance the safety of the aircraft during landing.


    The state of the art equipment is manufactured by M/s Indra Navia AS, Norway. The complete installation, alignment, testing, flight inspection and commissioning of the new Instrument Landing System has been done in-house by AAI’s CNS Technical Experts.
