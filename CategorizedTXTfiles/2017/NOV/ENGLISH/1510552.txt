    At the “Meet the Directors”; directors of Marathi Non-Feature Film ‘ Khidkee’ and Oriya Feature Film ‘Khynikaa’ (The Lost Idea) interacted with media today at International Film Festival of India, 2017 (IFFI) in Goa.


    Rohan Parushram Kanawade, who directed ‘ Khidkee’ , shared his experience about the film. The film is about Madhu, a middle aged homemaker whose life revolves around taking care of paralytic husband. Her only distraction is Ashwin, a youngster who lives in an opposite building. Ashwin is a writer who is frequently drawn to his living-room window through which he observes Madhu.


    Amartya Bhattacharya, National Film Awardee for cinematography, who directed ‘Khynikaa’ (The Lost Idea) talked about his film while interacting with media at IFFI 2017. His film is a tale of two men, a poet & a painter claiming possession over a same idea, in a rural village portrayed as a wonderland. They soon realize that an idea is no ones’ possession and it is not wise to rely on fate for judgment.
