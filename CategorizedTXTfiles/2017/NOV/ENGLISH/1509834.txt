    Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir has said we must have a robust cyber-security policy and there is an urgent need for skilled manpower. Addressing the inaugural session of the 6th International Conference & Exhibition on Homeland Security here today, he asked the industry to fulfill the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s objective of ‘Make in India’ and said the domestic manufacturers should invest more on R&D, particularly in Defence Production.
    
    Shri Ahir said the Government’s focus towards emerging Internal Security challenges is highlighted with the recent restructuring of Divisions in the MHA, resulting in the creation of Cyber and Information Security (CIS) Division and Counter-Terrorism and Counter-Radicalisation (CTCR) Division. Thefts resulting from cyber crimes and radicalization through the social media have altered the security dynamics and pose a grave challenge to the Security Agencies, he added.
    
    Expressing concern over an estimated more than one crore illegal immigrants in the country, Shri Ahir said the Government has taken several initiatives to secure the country’s porous borders by erecting Smart Fencing. He called upon the various stakeholders to come out with robust solutions to secure our country’s borders.
