    India and United Kingdom will soon sign an MoU in the urban transport sector for cooperation in policy planning, technology transfer and institutional organisation. The Minister of Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari met Rt Hon Chris Grayling, Secretary of State for Transport in the Government of UK in London yesterday, when the two sides discussed a draft MoU in this regard.


    The draft MoU seeks to facilitate cooperation in the transport sector and enable the sharing of expertize and latest technology to promote efficient mobility solutions. It is also expected to usher in policy reforms that can transform the transport sector through improved customer service/data analysis and better use of IT systems. The MOU will also help in promoting digital transactions and induction of high capacity diesel/electric vehicles in India. This MOU will also establish the terms on which such assistance can be provided.


    The decision to sign the MoU follows from Shri Gadkariâ€™s last visit to London in May this year, during which he finalized bilateral cooperation arrangements between Transport for London(TFL) and Indian Ministry of Road Transport & Highways to cover a wide range of transport mobility solutions and associated activities in urban environment.


    During his visit to London Shri Gadkari will also address a session of the International Maritime Organization. He also addressed Indian business leaders in UK, urging them to cooperate in the Namami Gange project of the Government.
