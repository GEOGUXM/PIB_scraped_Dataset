    Union Minister for Environment Forest and Climate Change, Science & Technology & Earth Sciences, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has said today that on account of pollution control measures and slight improvement in weather conditions, the declining trend in PM levels which started in the afternoon of November 12, 2017 continues even today and Delhi and NCR have now moved from emergency level to severe category of PM levels with PM10 being 392 µg/m3 and PM2.5 being 262 µg/m3 at 1300 hrs today. Appreciating the discipline shown by the public in general, Dr. Harsh Vardhan added that this has largely been achieved due to efforts of various government agencies and public participation based on voluntary actions.
    
    He further added that the IMD has predicted that weather conditions are likely to become more favourable for dispersal of pollutants over next 2-3 days and hence, air quality is expected to improve further. During the Task Force Meeting held at CPCB on November 13, 2017, the measures taken by the SPCBs were reviewed and they were requested to intensify the actions against violators, especially in industrial and the construction sectors, added Dr Harsh Vardhan.
    
    “At this juncture, while all government agencies have to maintain highest level of alertness and continue intense efforts at checking pollution, I would like to appeal to all citizens in Delhi & NCR to continue the good work and help us with achieving better levels of air quality”, added Dr Harsh Vardhan.
