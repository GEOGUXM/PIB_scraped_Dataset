The application will replace numerous legacy applications such as ‘Vastra’ and ‘Quarter Master Package’.


    The package comprises thirteen modules to automate all the logistics functions at unit level. The application can be dynamically configured to meet the specific requirements of various types of Army units and is capable of sharing information and data with other software applications in the domain of logistics management.


    The software has been developed with the aim of bringing speed, accuracy and transparency in handing logistics aspects in the unit. It will help in effective logistics management and decision making, thereby assisting Army units to be battle ready all the time. It will also play an important role in achieving automation of Indian Army and prove to be a significant milestone towards ‘Digital Army’ in consonance with the ‘Digital India initiative’ of the government.
