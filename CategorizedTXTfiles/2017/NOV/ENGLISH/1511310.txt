      Posted On: 30 NOV 2017 1:48PM by PIB Delhi


    Latest observations and satellite imageries indicate that the deep depression over Comorin area moved west-northwestwards with a speed of 38 kmph during past 06 hours and intensified into a cyclonic storm ‘OCKHI’ and lay centred at 0830 hrs IST of today, the 30 th November, 2017 over Comorin area and neighbourhood near Latitude 7.5º N and Longitude 77.5º E, about 340 km west-northwest of Galle (Sri Lanka), 60 km south of Kanyakumari, 120 km southeast of Thiruvananthapuram and 480 km east-southeast of Minicoy. The system is very likely to move west-northwestwards towards Lakshadweep Islands and intensify further into a severe cyclonic storm during next 24 hours.
