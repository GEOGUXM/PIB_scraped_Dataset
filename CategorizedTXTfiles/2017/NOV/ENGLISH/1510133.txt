    The wreaths were laid at the Teen Murti Memorial by the Cavalry Officers’ Association (COA) on 18 November 2017.
    
    Teen Murti Memorial was instituted in the memory of the Cavalry Officers and Men of the 15th Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade composed of Cavalry Regiments from the Indian States of Hyderabad, Mysore & Jodhpur and detachments from Bhavnagar, Kashmir and Kathiawar who sacrificed their lives during World War I (1914-1919), in the Sinai, Palestine and Syria. The Armoured Corps has traversed the journey in time since independence, with raising of modernised Tank Regiments.
    
    Speaking on the occasion, Lt Gen Amit Sharma (Retd), President COA highlighted the great contribution of the Indian Armoured Corps in protecting the Nation’s sovereignty. This is aptly reflected by the ‘Gallantry Awards’ earned by the Corps since independence, which includes Two Param Vir Chakras, 16 Mahavir Chakras, Three Kirti Chakras, 57 Vir Chakras and 26 Shaurya Chakras.
