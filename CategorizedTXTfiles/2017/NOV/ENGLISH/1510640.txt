    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:


    1.1 Crude oil production by ONGC during October, 2017 was 1889.67 TMT which is 3.88% lower than the monthly target but 0.93% higher when compared with October, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-October, 2017 was 13191.66 TMT which is 1.79% lower than target for the period but 2.25% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production with respect to target are as under:


    Ø Natural decline/increase in water cut in wells of matured fields of western offshore and less than estimated production from wells in SHP and NQO area due to de-optimization of wells.


    Ø Production from B-193 cluster in western offshore restricted due to high back pressure in B-193 export pipeline due to choking in the line.


    Ø Production from NBP field in western offshore affected due ESP related issues.


    Ø Frequent power shut downs in Mehsana, Ahmedabad & Assam hampered artificial lift operations.


    Ø Unexpected ceasure of more flowing wells in Mehsana Asset.


    Ø Wells closed for cluster drilling/ rig movements in Assam and Ahmedabad.


    1.2 Crude oil production by OIL during October, 2017 was 286.90 TMT which is 9.50% lower than monthly target but 4.09% higher than production in October, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-October, 2017 was 1980.50 TMT which is 9.53% lower than target for the period but 5.32% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


    Ø Less than planned contribution from old wells – Rise in water cut in wells and decline in total liquid production of wells of Greater Hapjan and Greater Chandmari Fields.


    Ø Less than planned contribution from work over wells.


    1.3 Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during October, 2017 was 861.68 TMT which is 4.58% lower than the monthly target and 4.57% lower than October, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-October, 2017 was 5890.83 TMT which is 5.48% lower than target for the period and 6.98% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


    Ø Around 120 wells are closed due to various reasons like high water cut, require work-over-job, etc. in RJ-ON-90/1


    Ø Bhagyam production is improving over last few months but reservoir is still underperforming vis-à-vis by Management Committee approved profile.


    Ø Production stopped from Guda and Kaameshwari-W due to non-availability of tankers from July 2017 onwards


    Ø Mangala production hampered due to power fluid pump tripping during Oct’17.


    Ø CY-ONN-2002/2: Test production from 5 oil wells. PML not yet granted.


    Ø CB-ONN-2004/2: Underperformance of wells.

    2. Natural gas production during October, 2017 was 2808.82 MMSCM which is 4.28% lower than the target for the month but 1.95% higher when compared with October, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production during April-October, 2017 was 19221.73 MMSCM which is 5.13% lower than target for the period but 4.02% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II . Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of October, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April-October, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

    Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production


    2.1 Natural gas production by ONGC during October, 2017 was 2017.97 MMSCM which is 0.46% higher than the monthly target and 3.86% higher when compared with October, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC during April-October, 2017 was 13693.21 MMSCM which is 1.27% lower than the cumulative target and 8.45% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year.Restricted gas production from B- series cluster due to non-availability one Process gas Compressor at MNP Complex under MH Asset.


    2.2 Natural gas production by OIL during October, 2017 was 243.25 MMSCM which is 3.55% lower than the monthly target and 1.03% lower than October, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-October, 2017 was 1724.51 MMSCM which is 1.80% lower than the cumulative target but 0.25% higher than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


    Ø Shut down of few non-associated gas well at various instances due to environmental problem.


    Ø Inability of customers to offtake gas from time to time due to plant breakdown at customer end.


    2.3 Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during October, 2017 was 547.60 MMSCM which is 18.68% lower than the monthly target and 3.31% lower when compared with October, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-October, 2017 was 3804 MMSCM which is 17.96% lower than the cumulative target and 7.94% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


    Ø Underperformance of wells in KG- OSN-2001/3 (GSPC).


    Ø Closure of 2 wells in D1D3 field and 1 well in MA Field in KG-DWN-98/3 (RIL).


    Ø Sohagpur West: Underperformance of CBM wells. Sales hampered due to IFFCO Unit partial Shutdown (RIL).


    Ø Raniganj East (CBM Block): Few wells closed for planned maintenance and refrac jobs (ESSAR).


    Ø AAP-ON-94/1: Production deferred due to delay in grant of PML. Well shutdown due to low consumer demand during October, 2017 (HOEC).


    3. Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)


    Refinery production during October, 2017 was 22107.99 TMT which is 1.51% higher than the target for the month and 5.13% higher when compared with October, 2016. Cumulative production during April-October, 2017 was 144605.01 TMT which is 3.37% higher than the target for the period and 1.45% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III . Company-wise production for the month of October, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April-October, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

    3.1 CPSE Refineries’ production during October, 2017 was 12618.53 TMT which is only 0.04% higher than the target for the month and 6.52% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-October, 2017 was 82788.46 TMT which is 4.48% higher than the target for the period and 4.51% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


    Ø IOCL, Barauni: Throughput is lower than plan due to restricted crude processing due to HSD upliftment.


    Ø IOCL, Paradip: Throughput is lower due to steam air de-coking shutdown in the chain of delayed Coker Unit.


    Ø CPCL CBR: Throughput lower due to product upliftment constraints


    3.2 Production in JV refineries during October, 2017 was 1611.29 TMT which is 9.76% higher than the target for the month and 12.94% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-October, 2017 was 8096.78 TMT which is 1.44% higher than the target for the period but 20.63% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year.


    3.3 Production in private refineries during October, 2017 was 7878.17 TMT which is 2.36% higher than the target for the month and 1.56% higher when compared with October, 2016. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-October, 2017 was 53719.77 TMT which is 1.99% higher than the target for the period and 1.14% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year.


    3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of October, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April-October, 2017 vis-à-vis April-October, 2016 are given at Annexures - IV and V respectively.
