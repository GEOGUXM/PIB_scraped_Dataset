        On 30 th October 2017, Lieutenant General PM Hariz, General Officer Commanding in Chief Southern Command and Colonel of the Regiment of Mechanised Infantry paid a visit to their affiliated Indian Navy Ship, INS Ghariyal. He complimented all on board for their commitment and professional excellence. He urged them to continue the cooperation and further build on it to achieve greater synergy.


        The case for affiliation of the Mechanised Infantry Regiment with INS Ghariyal was initiated in January 1999 by late Lieutenant General PS Joshi and was approved on 24 February 1999. INS Ghariyal is the second Landing Ship Tank (Large) of Indian Navy, which was built indigenously and was commissioned on 14 February 1997. The ship can carry troops and vehicles and hence is ideally suited for amphibious operations. Due to the above it is closely associated with the Mechanised Infantry where both compliment each other evenly.
