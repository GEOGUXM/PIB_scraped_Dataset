      Fishing boat Jehovah Jireh in Palk Bay
      Posted On: 22 NOV 2017 1:26PM by PIB Delhi


    In context of incorrect and mischievous reporting by some of the media channels on Tamil Nadu regarding alleged incident involving fishing boat Jehovah Jireh in Palk Bay, following is stated:


    Coast Guard Station Commander being quoted by some of the media channels, has himself clearly stated that Coast Guard ship in question is not under his command and therefore he cannot confirm or deny anything on the incident. There is absolutely no mention made by the officer regarding use of any force or bullets on the fishermen in Jehovah Jireh.


    The Coast Guard vide their press release dated November 14, 2017 has already stated in absolutely clear terms that “there was no use of force or any firing by Indian Coast Guard on the fishing boat- Jehovah Jireh in Palk Bay”. Mischievous twists and turns being given by section of media in Tamil Nadu to discredit the Raksha Mantri’s statement that no bullets were fired on the fishermen is therefore highly condemnable. It will therefore behove well for all concerned to check the facts before commenting.
