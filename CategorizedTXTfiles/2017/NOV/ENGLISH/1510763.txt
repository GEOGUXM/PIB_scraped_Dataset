    The President of India, Shri Ram NathKovind, addressed the closing ceremony of the 42nd World Congress of the International Committee of Military Medicine (ICMM), today (November 24, 2017) in New Delhi.


    Speaking on the occasion, the President said that for nearly a century now, ICMM has been making a meaningful impact in the practice of military medicine across the world. It truly works at the ‘cutting edge’ of the medical profession. Through its Regional and World Congress, ICMM provides a global platform for sharing and meaningful learning.


    The President said that the medical service is an important pillar for any military. The Armed Forces Medical Services of India have been providing stellar service not only to the Armed Forces but have also been in the service of the nation both in peace and war. They are the most valuable first responders in times of natural and man-made calamities and crises and are in a perpetual state of readiness. The onus of promoting and delivering preventive, curative and rehabilitative medical care for the serving soldier and his family, including our esteemed veterans, has been carried out by the Armed Forces Medical Services with commendable professionalism.
