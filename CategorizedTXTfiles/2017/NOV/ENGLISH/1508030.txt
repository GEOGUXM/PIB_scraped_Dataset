      Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba chaired a meeting here yesterday to discuss various measures including technology upgradation, provision of modern equipment, additional space, professional manpower etc. for improving immigration services at Delhi Airport. Senior officers of Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Bureau of Immigration (BOI), National Informatics Centre (NIC) and Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) were present.


      Following decisions have been taken to improve the immigration services:-


      · DIAL will provide additional space for at least 10 more immigration counters at “Departure area” by November 15, 2017. BOI will provide manpower and other equipment like passport reading machines, computers, web cameras etc. to make these counters functional by November 20, 2017.


      · Additional space will be provided by DIAL for providing 10 more additional immigration counters for facilitation of travelers in the ‘Departure area’. These counters would be made functional by January, 2018.


      · At least 10 e-Visa counters would be made functional for electronic Visa facility for foreigners by November 30, 2017.


      · 25 more counters for electronic Visa facility will be made functional by January, 2018. This will facilitate foreigners availing electronic Visa which is becoming increasingly popular.


      · Bureau of Immigration will provide additional manpower of 1,800 personnel for improving immigration services by filling up vacant posts, inducting personnel from Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and also some ex-servicemen. This will augment manpower strength at immigration counters to enable Immigration Officers to provide professional and courteous service to the travelers.


      The above decisions will substantially improve Immigration services at Delhi International Airport which will facilitate not only foreigners coming to India, but also Indian travelers visiting abroad.


      The meeting followed MHA taking cognizance of recent reports about long queues at Delhi International Airport during peak hours. Senior officers of MHA and Bureau of Immigration subsequently visited Delhi International Airport for on-the-spot assessment.


      Government has policy to encourage foreigners to come to India for tourism, medical tourism, business, studies etc. Several initiatives have been taken to improve Visa and immigration services to encourage foreigners to visit India and to provide them a pleasant experience.
