    On account of implementation of GST w.e.f. 1st July, 2017, there may be instances where the retail sale price of a pre-packaged commodity is required to be changed. In this context, Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri Ram Vilas Paswan had allowed the manufacturers or packers or importers of pre-packaged commodities to declare the revised retail sale price (MRP) in addition to the existing retail sale price (MRP), for three months w.e.f. 1st July 2017 to 30th September, 2017. Declaration of the changed retail sale price (MRP) was allowed to be made by way of stamping or putting sticker or online printing, as the case may be.


    Use of unexhausted packaging material/wrapper was also been allowed upto 30th September, 2017 after making the necessary corrections.


    Considering the requests received to extend the permission for some more time it has been extended to display the revised MRP due to implementation of GST by way of stamping or putting sticker or online printing for a further period of three months, i.e. up to 31st December, 2017.


    As Government has reduced the rates of GST on certain specified items, Shri Ram Vilas Paswan, Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, has granted permission under sub-rule (3) of rule 6 of the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011, to affix an additional sticker or stamping or online printing for declaring the reduced MRP on the pre-packaged commodity. In this case also, the earlier Labelling/ Sticker of MRP will continue to be visible.


    This relaxation will also be applicable in the case of unsold stocks manufactured/ packed/ imported after 1st July, 2017 where the MRP would reduce due to reduction in the rate of GST post 1st July, 2017.


    The above permission/ relaxation will be available upto 31st December, 2017.
