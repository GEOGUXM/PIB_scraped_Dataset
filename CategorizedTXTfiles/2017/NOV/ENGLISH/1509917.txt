      On the occasion of WORLD DIABETES DAY, a lecture was organised by the Army on 14 Nov 17 at Gulmarg to spread awareness about one of the most important lifestyle disorders.

        Diabetes nowadays, affects almost all age groups and thus, awareness about its underlying causes, preventive measures and management should be known to all. The lecture by the Army Medical Officer was attended by approx 60 civilians and 35 service personnel. The audience had lots of queries which were suitably answered by the medical officer.


        Refreshments were served after the lecture, which provided further opportunity for informal interaction with the civilians of the area. They thanked the Army for this informative lecture and expressed their desire for more such lectures in future.
