    Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr. Subhash Bhamre will represent the Government of India at the ‘UN Peacekeeping Defence Ministerial: Vancouver 2017’, which is being held between November 14-15, 2017. It will be the second time Dr. Bhamre will be attending the conference. He will be speaking on November 15.
    
    Over 500 delegates from more than 70 countries and international organisations are expected to gather at the Defence Ministerial in Vancouver. Along with representatives from the African Union, the European Union, NATO and the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, these delegates are going to discuss improvements to UN peacekeeping operations.
    
    Decisive discussions will be taking place during the conference. While ensuring that the integration of gender perspective remains at the heart of the talks, these discussions will revolve around four themes.
    
    Focus will be on peacekeeping and youth as peacebuilders. The discussion will also explore the importance of economic development in preventing conflict in fragile states and in sustainably rebuilding post-conflict states.
    
    The last meeting was held in London in the month of September 2016. The conference had taken up issues on Women, Peace and Security, Pre and Post Deployment, Tackling Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (SEA) and Improving Peacekeeping – Rapid Deployment.
