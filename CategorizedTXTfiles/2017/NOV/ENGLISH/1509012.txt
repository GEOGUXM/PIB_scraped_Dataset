    Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has planned to conduct State specific APY mobilization Campaigns under the title “People First”. The People First campaign will be a series of campaigns conducted at various states across the country to increase APY outreach.

    
    To begin with, People First Campaign is being conducted in the State of Uttar Pradesh from 7th- 14th November 2017. In the first three days, more than 15,000 APY accounts have been sourced in UP. All the banks and its branches and postal branches are participating in the Campaign with enthusiasm. UP has more than 17,000 APY touch points which include all bank branches and post offices in the State. Out of 17,000 branches, more than 15000 branches have sourced at least one APY account in the current year.
    
    At the end of the Campaign, PFRDA has planned to recognize the achievers under the criteria given below.
    
    UP is the largest State in the country with a population of 7.1 crore in the APY scheme age group of 18-40 years. UP State is the largest contributor so far in the scheme, with nearly 7 lacs enrolment. There is however considerable scope for future growth in APY enrolments in the State.
    
    Overall, APY subscriber base has reached 71 lacs and more than 10,000 APY accounts are getting opened every day.
    
    Based on the success of the Campaign, PFRDA is planning to roll out similar campaigns in other States such as Bihar, MP and Rajasthan in the next few weeks.
