We must make every effort to ensure their welfare. We should also make all possible efforts to ensure that children in our country have a safe and happy childhood. Every child is a bud waiting to blossom. By awarding children, we recognise and encourage their talent and potential for nation building. We should also recognise the significant contribution of individuals and institutions who work for causes related to children.”
