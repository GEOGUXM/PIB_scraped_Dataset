The index for 'Manufacture of Wood and of Products of Wood and Cork ' group declined by 0.1 percent to 132.3 (provisional) from 132.4 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of wooden panel and wooden block-compressed or not (2% each) and plywood block boards and wooden splint (1% each). However, the price of particle boards, wooden board (non-electrical) and wood cutting, processed/sized (1% each) moved up.

The index for 'Manufacture of Pharmaceuticals, Medicinal Chemical and Botanical Products' group rose by 0.5 percent to 122.1 (provisional) from 121.5 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of anti cancer drugs (5%), ayurvedic medicaments (3%), antibiotics & preparations thereof and antipyretic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory formulations (2% each) and medical accessories and api & formulations of vitamins (1% each). However, the price of anti-malarial drugs (8%), vaccine for polio (7%), vials/ampoule, glass, empty or filled (3%), sulpha drugs and plastic capsules (2% each) and cotton wool (medicinal) (1%)

The index for 'Manufacture of other Non-Metallic Mineral Products' group declined by 0.1 percent to 111.8 (provisional) from 111.9 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of ordinary sheet glass (3%), ordinary portland cement (2%) and poles & posts of concrete, pozzolana cement, plain bricks and cement superfine (1% each). However, the price of porcelain sanitary ware (4%), non ceramic tiles and clinker (3% each), lime & calcium carbonate (2%) and porcelain crockery, marble slab, asbestos corrugated sheet, toughened glass, stone, chip and cement blocks (concrete) (1% each) moved up.

The index for 'Manufacture of Motor Vehicles, Trailers and Semi-Trailers' group rose by 0.1 percent to 110.6 (provisional) from 110.5 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of brake pad/brake liner/brake block/brake rubber, others (3%) and minibus/bus, axles of motor vehicles, piston ring/piston & compressor, radiators & coolers and crankshaft (1% each). However, the price of body (for commercial motor vehicles) (5%) and chain (1%) declined.

The index for 'Other Manufacturing' group rose by 1.2 percent to 106.6 (provisional) from 105.3 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of stringed musical instruments (incl. santoor, guitars, etc.) (14%), cricket bat and silver (2% each) and gold & gold ornaments (1%). However, the price of cricket ball and non mechanical toys (1% each) declined.
