    The Ministry of Women and Child Development is initiating an extensive training programme through National Institute of Public Cooperation and Child Development (NIPCCD) of the Ministry with an objective of empowering Elected Women Representatives(EWRs). This Capacity Building Programme will be inaugurated by the Minister for Women and Child Development, Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi in New Delhi on 27th November, 2017 in the presence of Minister of State for Women and Child Development Dr. Virendra Kumar. Around 500 EWRs and nearly 200 master trainers from different corners of the country will be attending this session of the programme.
    
    The Capacity building of Elected Women Representatives (EWRs) is critical to empower women to participate effectively in governance processes. This will help them assume the leadership roles expected of them and guide their villages towards a more prosperous future.
    
    The 73rd amendment to the Constitution of India has bestowed Panchayats with functional, financial and administrative powers and responsibilities for overall development, and this is a great opportunity for women to participate in nation-building.
    
    Empowered EWRs can ensure the percolation of knowledge, awareness and legal empowerment. This training programme of WCD Ministry will ultimately train approximately 20,000 EWRs, covering approximately 50 EWRs from each district. They will serve as catalysts for social change and function as peer facilitators in the field.
