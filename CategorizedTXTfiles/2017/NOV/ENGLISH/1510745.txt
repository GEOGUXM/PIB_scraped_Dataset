    The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that unity and integrity is the strength of our country. He was interacting with the members of a delegation from National Foundation of Communal Harmony, who presented him a Flag Sticker on the occasion of ‘The Communal Harmony Campaign week’, here today.


    The Vice President said that we have to protect and follow the rich cultural heritage of our motherland which we have inherited from our forefathers. He further said that our culture is much ancient than many other in the world. Irrespective of caste, creed, race or religion we are all one, he added.


    The Vice President said that India was once known as ‘Viswaguru’ and students from several countries used to come here and study in our universities such as Takshashila, Nalanda and other centres of learning. The situation has changed following Mughal invasions and the British colonization and now the time has come for India to once again emerge as the global knowledge hub, he added.


    The Vice President wished the students all the very best.
