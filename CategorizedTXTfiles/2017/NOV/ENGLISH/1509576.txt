      Posted On: 15 NOV 2017 1:27PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government of India has been making concerted efforts to reduce vehicular emissions and improve fuel efficiencywith an aim to reduce the carbon footprints and keep a healthy environment. India has followed the regulatory pathway for fuel quality and vehicle emissions standards termed as Bharat Stage (BS).


    The Ministry of Petroleum and natural Gas has successfully introduced the BS-IV grade transportation fuels across the country w.e.f April 1st 2017. With the launch of BS-IV grade fuel, a new era of clean transportation fuels has begun which will benefit all citizens of our country by substantially reducing pollution levels. Migration to BS-IV grade fuels shows Indiaâ€™s resolve to cut down emissions.


    As a next step in this direction, Government in consultation with stakeholders has decided to meet international best practices by leapfrogging directly from BS-IV to BS-VI grade by 1stApril, 2020, skipping BS-V altogether. Oil refining companies are making huge investments in fuel up gradation projects to produce the BS-VI grade fuels.


    Taking into account the serious pollution levels in Delhi and adjoining areas,Petroleum Ministry in consultation with Public Oil Marketing Companies has decided for preponement of BS-VI grade auto fuels in NCT of Delhi w.e.f 01.04.2018 instead of 01.04.2020. OMCs have also been asked to examine the possibility of introduction of BS-VI auto fuels in the whole of NCR area w.e.f 01.04.2019.


    This measure is expected to help mitigate the problem of air pollution in NCT of Delhi and surrounding areas.
