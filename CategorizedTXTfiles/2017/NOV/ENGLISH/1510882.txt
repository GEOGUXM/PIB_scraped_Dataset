      French producer Sebastien Aubert, who was named among the "100 businessmen who will change France" today, attended a special press conference for Cinema of the World, organized at the 48th International Film Festival of India representing his film “Strange One’s”. He was joined by young actor Bogdan Iancu who stars in “In Blue”.

        While Strange One's is a film about mysterious events surrounding two travelers as they make their way across a remote American landscape; In Blue, follows the story of a sturdy flight attendant who has to deliver a child in mid-air and gets involved in a confusing mother/lover relationship with a boy who's living under the streets of Bucharest.


        Actor Bogdan Iancu said, “I’m so honoured to be part of In Blue. I was able to convey the emotions behind the situation in Romania through this film”.


        Producer Sebastien Aubert said, “It’s exciting to be here at IFFI. I’ve watched some great Indian films here and hope to produce some. We started to develop Strange One’s in France and later it traveled to over 30 festivals. It’s the first time we are bringing the film here, so this screening in India is the film’s Asian premiere”.


        The 48th Edition of IFFI takes place from the 20th to 28th of November, 2017 in the beach state of Goa.
