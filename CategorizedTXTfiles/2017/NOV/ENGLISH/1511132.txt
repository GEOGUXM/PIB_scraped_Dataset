A total of approximately 1.75 lakh households (1.62 lakh rural households and 0.13 lakh urban households) of Manipur are proposed to be included under the Scheme.
    
    Addressing the media at the function, Shri R.K. Singh said that Manipur is the fastest reforming state in Power sector in the country and the Manipur Government is performing well in terms of power sector in the State.
    
    Shri R.K. Singh further said that it is the vision of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to provide electricity to every household of the country. Now the Government would come to peopleâ€™s doorstep to provide power connection to every household. This is such a scheme where the poorest of the poor can afford electricity in their homes. The Minister promised that people would get 24x7 power supply by March, 2019. For achieving this target, the Government has already given obligation to private companies to provide 24x7 power supply to every household, he added.
    
    Union Minister also assured that the Government of India would provide the required financial assistance for strengthening and improvement of infrastructure in the power sector in Manipur. Monetary assistance had already been extended for procuring of transformers, meters etc. to strengthen the power sector in the State, he added.
    
    On the occasion, Shri N. Biren Singh said that under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the Saubhagya Scheme would transform the lives, especially poorest of the poor by providing power supply to every household of the country.

Keeping in view the role of electricity in human and socio-economic development, Government of India has formulated the scheme to ensure last mile connectivity and electricity connections to all remaining un-electrified urban and rural households in the country. All States and Union Territories of the country are required to complete household electrification in their respective jurisdiction by 31st March, 2019.
