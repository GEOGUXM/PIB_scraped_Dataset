    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, addressed the 2 nd convocation of the Indira Gandhi National Tribal University today (November 11, 2017) at Amarkantak, Madhya Pradesh.


    Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the establishment of the National Tribal University in Madhya Pradesh was appropriate as the state has a 15 million strong tribal population. The University’s aim is to help tribal youth participate with greater vigour in the building of modern India by giving them the best possible opportunities in education.


    The President said that a university convocation was not just a ceremony to honour students who were graduating; it was an opportunity to dedicate to society the services of an educated, equipped and disciplined cadre of youth. A convocation is not the end of education but the beginning of a responsible life.


    The President called upon students to leave an imprint on society that was so meaningful that the University could be presented as a model for the entire nation. He expressed confidence that the graduates would always keep learning and would make a significant contribution to the uplift of the underprivileged in our society, and to the progress of the nation.
