      The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, has sent his greetings to fellow citizens on the eve of birthday of Guru Nanak Devji.


      In a message, the President has said, “On the auspicious occasion of the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev, I extend my heartiest greetings to all, and especially to all the brothers and sisters of the Sikh community in India and abroad.


      Guru Nanak Dev gave us an enlightened message of peace, harmony and of the unity of all human beings. He stood against exploitation and atrocity, and dedicated himself to the service and welfare of the underprivileged. As encapsulated in the Japji, his teachings about love and faith, truth and sacrifice, and moral conduct have eternal spiritual value. He epitomises the quest for equality of all men and women, and universal, humanist values.


      On this day, may each one of us endeavour to use Guru Nanak’s noble teachings in our daily lives and work to strengthen the sense of oneness, fraternity and mutual goodwill in our society”.
