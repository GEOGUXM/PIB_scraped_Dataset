        Methodology of Estimation


        (1) Taxes on products at current prices


        Taxes on products for compiling GDP include both GST and non-GST revenue. GST revenue based on GSTR filings as provided by Central Board of Excise and Customs, Department of Revenue, Ministry Finance has been used. This include CGST, SGST, UTGST, IGST (domestic and imports), Cess (Domestic and Imports). The non- GST revenue include Central and State excise duties, custom duties and sales tax on goods outside the tax base of GST like Crude oil, Petrol, Diesel, ATF& Natural gas and Alcohol for human consumption etc.


        (2) Taxes on products at constant prices


        Present methodology of compiling constant price estimates of taxes on products by volume extrapolation has been adopted in line with the methodology prescribed under of System of National accounts, 2008. Volume extrapolation is done using volume growth of taxed goods and services and aggregated to get the total volume of taxes.


        (3) Estimating GVA from trade sector .


        GVA from Trade sector is estimated using an index of turnover based on Sales tax. With introduction of GST, sales tax data is now subsumed under GST. In the GSTR-3B returns that are now being filed, total outward taxable supplies is available without HSN/SAC codes. This taxable value of outward supplies is inclusive of both services and goods. Sales Tax/VAT is imposed on sale or purchase of goods. Till such time the taxable value of goods supplied become available from tax records, a comparable estimate of turn over based on sales tax will have to be estimated. Following three approaches to project likely sales tax collection were examined.


        (a) Ratio of Sales tax collected on specific products like POL which are outside the tax base of GST and the total sales tax collected from 2014-15 onwards were examined. It was observed that the ratios were by and large stable. Using this relationship, likely sales tax collection for second quarter of 2017-18 was projected.


        (b) Forecasting quarterly sales tax data for Q2 2017-18 based on regression of Sales tax on value of output of commodity producing sectors available from 2011-12 onwards. To account for seasonal fluctuations, seasonal dummy variables were used.


        (c) Estimating sales tax collection by using nominal growth in output of commodity producing sectors that are taxed.
