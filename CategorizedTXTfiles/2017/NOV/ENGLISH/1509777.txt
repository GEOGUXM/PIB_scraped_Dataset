The Hon’ble Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi will inaugurate the mega event, while Smt. Sushma Swaraj , Hon’ble Minister of External Affairs will deliver the keynote address in the Valedictory function.


      Incepted in 2011 in London , second GCCS was held in 2012 in Budapest with focus on relationship between internet rights and internet security, which was attended by 700 delegates from nearly 60 countries. The third edition of GCCS was held in 2013 in Seoul with commitment to Open and Secure Cyberspace. The fourth version GCCS 2015 was held on April 16-17, 2015 in The Hague, Netherlands which saw participation from 97 countries.


      Themed on Cyber4All: A Secure and Inclusive Cyberspace for Sustainable Development , this is the fifth edition of GCCS wherein international leaders, policymakers, industry experts, think tanks and cyber experts will gather to deliberate on issues and challenges for optimally using cyber space. The overall goals of GCCS 2017 are to promote the importance of inclusiveness and human rights in global cyber policy, to defend the status quo of an open, interoperable and unregimented cyberspace, to create political commitment for capacity building initiatives to address the digital divide and assist countries, and to develop security solutions in a balanced fashion that duly acknowledge the importance of the private sector and technical community.


      While briefing the press, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad , Hon’ble Minister for Electronics & IT and Law & Justice, said, “This is a historic moment for all of us to host the Fifth edition of the Global Conference of Cyberspace in India. I believe it is recognition of India’s emerging role as a massive cyber power, accelerated by the Digital India push, which has acquired international acknowledgment. The GCCS 2017 is certainly in accord with the Hon’ble Prime Minister’s vision to transform India into a digitally empowered country . GCCS 2017 will give the world’s cyber community a unique opportunity to learn from global experience and expert insight, and discover more about the technology led transformation being engineered in India. As India is poised to become a US$1 Trillion digital economy and lead the digital revolution in the world, it is imperative to formulate and put across a robust cyber space.”


      “The GCCS 2017 is going to be four times bigger than its previous edition in terms of its magnitude. The last conference held in The Netherlands saw about 1800 delegates, and I am happy to announce that we have over 10000 delegates who will participate in person. There will also be virtual participation from over 2800 locations across the world will be connected in an interactive mode. We have had over 40 Run-up events around the world since March 2017 to precede the main event that received an unprecedented response from the policy makers, industry, academia, civil society and think tanks.
