    Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu, Vice-President of Inida, will inaugurate the 10 th Urban Mobility Conference in the city tomorrow. The three day conference from Nov 3-6, 2017 is jointly being organised by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, Government of India, Government of Telangana and French Organisation CODATU involved in urban transportation.


    Announcing this at a press conference here today, Shri Mukund Kumar Sinha, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, said that, urbanisation in India is growing at an exponential rate and is likely to reach 50% by 2050. The cities being engines of growth are facing challenges like pollution, congestion on roads and lack of infrastructure. He said the conference in which 1000 policy makers including Mayors and Municipal Councillors, urban planners from 20 Indian states and 25 foreign countries, would participate, will deliberate on various aspects of urban cities in 86 cities, including 36 foreign cities. The conference is being organised to further National Urban Transport Policy which lays stress on ‘moving the people rather than the cars’, he said.


    Information and Public Relations Commissioner, Shri Navin Mittal expressed happiness over the conference being organised in Hyderabad which is a fine example of a city which is coming to terms with its growing population and providing urban transport with the upcoming Metro Rail Project.


    Shri N.V.S. Reddy, MD, Metro Rail Transport, said that Hyderabad will shortly have the largest Metro Rail work built in PPP (Public Private Participation) mode. He said, the Metro stations coming up in Hyderabad would be ultra modern and top class.


    Shri A.A. Rao, ADG, PIB also spoke.
