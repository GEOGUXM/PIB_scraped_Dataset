    We are committed for creating new jobs and industries, said Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Suresh Prabhu today at CII Manufacturing Summit-2017 named "Re-Inventing Indian Manufacturing" in Mumbai.


    The Minister said that priorities of government and industries are getting aligned now and entrepreneurship must be encouraged. He also said that government will push agriculture significantly to boost food processing sector and develop industries corridors as well. Emphasizing importance of manufacturing, he said, “Manufacturing must be promoted and also channelized effectively”.


    About ‘Make In India’ campaign, he said that ‘Make in India’ is nothing but making of India by transformation. India is a largest importer of electronic goods so we must work to be self-dependent in this field so that import oriented approach could be changed, he added.


    The Minister stressed that District must be taken as a unit and we must link local people in our effort to boost industries. The government has already started to connect with local people on ground level.


    On small industries, Minister said that we must change our approach towards small industries. Their contribution in R&D is remarkable. Ease of Doing business is adequately promoted by the government on several fronts and India is a global market.Tuning industries with global standard is need of the hour he added.
