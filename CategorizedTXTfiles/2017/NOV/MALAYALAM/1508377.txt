    The 30 inmates of the ‘Good Hope’ old age home (situated at Fort Kochi) were hosted by the naval personnel of INS Dronacharya ladies of the Naval Wives Welfare Association (NWWA) for the better part of the day on 06 Nov 17.


    The distinguished visitors were received by the Commanding Officer, Commodore Simon Mathai, NM, and were entertained with some soulful songs by the choir group of the Navy Children School, Kochi, children from the NKG, Dronacharya Jazz Band and Naval trainees. A drill performance was also conducted, involving two continuity drill contingents, displaying precisely synchronised drill movements without any commands. The visit ended with a trip to the Riding and Adventure and Sports (RAS) Centre wherein they were provided an opportunity to pet and feed trained horses. Lunch was also organised for the inmates at the Home.


    The visit marked the culmination of community services carried out by the staff of INS Dronacharya at the ‘Good Hope’ old age home from 01-05 November with the sole aim of providing a helping hand to its inmates. These included repairs and cleaning of common areas, painting of the periphery wall and main gate and maintenance of the garden to give a facelift to the old age home. The Old Age Home was also donated various utility items by the Dronacharya team and NWWA, including toiletries, groceries, medicines, induction heaters, water purifier, iron box etc.


    Sister Darshana and Sister Symbrose, on behalf of all inmates, expressed heartfelt thanks and gratitude to the ladies of NWWA and the naval personnel of INS Dronacharya.
