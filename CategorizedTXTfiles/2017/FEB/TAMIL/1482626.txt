    The Income Tax Department had initiated Operation Clean Money , on 31.1.2017. Initial phase of the operation involves e-verification of large cash deposits made during 9 th November to 30 th December 2016. In the first batch, around 18 lakh persons have been identified in whose case, cash transactions do not appear to be in line with the tax payer’s profile.


    The Income Tax Department has enabled online verification of these transactions. Tax payers who are not yet registered on the e-filing portal (at https://incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in ) should register by clicking on the ‘Register Yourself’ button available on the home page. Registered taxpayers should verify and update their email address and mobile number on the e-filing portal to receive electronic communication.


    The taxpayers covered in this phase should submit their response on the portal on or before 15th February 2017 in order to avoid any notice from the Income Tax Department and enforcement actions under the Income-tax Act as also other applicable laws.
