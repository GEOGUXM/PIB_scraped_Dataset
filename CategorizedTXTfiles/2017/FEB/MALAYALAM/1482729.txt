The units totaling to a cost of Rs. 33, 47,000 would ensure continuing high quality care for the infants undergoing treatment. This is the first time that the Institute has received contribution from the MPLAD Scheme.
      Shri. Surash Gopi MP will officially hand over the units at a meeting on 16th February 2017 at 10 am to be held at SCTIMST. Shri. K.M. Chandrasekhar, President SCTIMS and Prof. Asha Kishore Director SCTIMST will also participate in the function.

It is a state of art machine keeping the neonates warm with a feedback control from the baby's temperature and also has facility to weigh the baby, give phototherapy in case of jaundice and provisions to make taking X rays easier.
