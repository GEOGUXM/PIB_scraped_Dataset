    The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee has extended his greetings and felicitations to the Government and people of St. Lucia on the eve of their Independence Day (February 22, 2017).
    
    In a message to Her Excellency Ms. Dame Pearlette Louisy, the Governor General of Saint Lucia, the President has said, “On behalf of the Government and people of India and on my own behalf, it gives me great pleasure to extend warm greetings and felicitations to you and to the people of Saint Lucia on the occasion of your Independence Day.
    
    Our nations have enjoyed a long standing relationship reinforced by warm friendship and cooperation. The convergence of our views on a number of global issues has contributed to our excellent coordination in international fora. The recent visit of our Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship to Saint Lucia has enhanced our mutual understanding. Our ties have been further reinforced by our joint efforts in the Commonwealth and CARICOM. I am confident that our bilateral relations will be further strengthened for our mutual benefit in the years to come.
    
    I avail this opportunity to convey to Your Excellency, my best wishes for your good health and personal well-being, as well as for the progress and continued prosperity of the friendly people of Saint Lucia”.
