      Posted On: 07 FEB 2017 1:28PM by PIB Delhi


    As per the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002, a physician should clearly display his fees and other charges on the board of his chamber and/or the hospitals he is visiting. Further, a physician should announce his fees before rendering service and not after the operation or treatment is under way and remuneration received for such services should be in the form and amount specifically announced to the patient at the time the service is rendered.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
