    The second batch of volunteers from villages adopted by RashtrapatiBhavan under the ‘Smart Gram’ Initiative were presented certificates on completion of their training under Skill development and Internship training programme at a function held in RashtrapatiBhavan today (February 14, 2017).


    
    After presenting the certificates, Secretary to the President, Smt. Omita Paul said that the experiment of training in traditional systems of medicine at RashtrapatiBhavan has resulted in a kind of movement focusing on AYUSH which is spreading. Already five batches of trainees have successfully completed their training at the AYUSH Wellness Clinic in RashtrapatiBhavan. With the aim of giving relief to patients, efforts have also been made to connect traditional systems of medicines with the allopathic system. She urged the trainees to always have an open mind and remember that learning is a lifelong process. She also hoped that the training would not only benefit the volunteers but also the people of the villages where they came from.


    
    Volunteers from villages of Dhaula, Alipur, Harchandpur and RojkaMeo were imparted training for sixty days in traditional systems of medicine. Red Cross Society also provided First Aid training and the National Skill Development Corporation collaborated with RashtrapatiBhavan with regard to Recognition of Prior Learning. A total of five batches have been successfully trained at AYUSH Wellness Clinic of RashtrapatiBhavan so far, of which those who received certificates today were the second batch of trained volunteers from villages adopted by RashtrapatiBhavan.
