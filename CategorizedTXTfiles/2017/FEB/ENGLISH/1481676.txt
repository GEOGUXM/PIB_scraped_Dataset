          The measures taken by the Government through Central Silk Board (CSB) to improve the quality of indigenous silk are given below:

          (i) Production of Bivoltine Silk: Bivoltine silkis the high quality mulberry silk produced in India as an import substitute silk. The following measures are taken to produce Bivoltine silk in India:
          · Strengthening the Research & Development system to improve the levels of cocoon production and productivity.
          · During XII Plan, 176 clusters have been organized under Cluster Promotion Programme (CPP) to augment the production of bivoltine silk production in the country. Bivoltine silk production has increased from 1,685 MTs in 2011-12 to 4,613 MTs during 2015-16.
          · Improved mulberry varieties viz. V1, G4, G2 have been developed to promote Bivoltine sericulture.
          · Bivoltine hybrids like CSR2 x CSR4, CSR16 x CSR17, FC1xFC2 & FC3xFC4 have been developed and are being used for production of better quality BV silk in Southern region throughout the year. Two new bivoltine hybrids viz., G11xG19 and B.con1xB.con4 with better yield and adaptation are under popularisation.
          · Cold Storage facilities and Bivoltine grainages have been strengthened to produce quality Bivoltine silkworm seed.
          · Silkworm Seed Act is being implemented to bring quality standards in silkworm seed production to improve the productivity and quality of silk.
          · Intensive Bivoltine Sericulture project at a total cost of Rs.236.78 Cr. implemented in eight North Eastern States from 2015-16 exclusively to promote Bivoltine silk, under North Eastern Region-Textiles Promotion Scheme (NERTPS).
          · Automatic Reeling Units are set up in the country for production of 3A-4A grade raw silk from bivoltine hybrid cocoons.
          (ii) Production of Vanya Silk (Muga, Eri and Tasar):
          · Integrated Sericulture Development Project (ISDP): Under North Eastern Region Textiles Promotion Scheme (NERTPS), Government has approved 14 Sericulture Projects with a total cost of Rs. 523.33 crore (GoI share of Rs. 423.33 crores) for implementation in NE States to promote Vanya Silk.
          · Central Silk Board has developed latest technology packages, improved farm machineries, indigenous automatic reeling units and Vanya silk reeling and spinning units to reduce drudgery and improve quality and productivity of Vanya silk.
