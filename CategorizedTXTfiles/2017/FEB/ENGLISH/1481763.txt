The rural economy is also expected to be supported by the emphasis given by the Budget on employment generation. The manufacturing sector is likely to benefit from measures announced in the Budget 2017-18 like lower income tax for companies with annual turnover up to Rs 50 crore; allowing carry-forward of MAT credit up to a period of 15 years instead of 10 years at present; further measures to improve the ease of doing business; and the scheme for creating employment in the leather and footwear industries. Apart from the measures listed above to encourage business and enterprise, the services sector will also be boosted by the major push to digital economy and the focus on infrastructure like construction and affordable housing.
    
    The decision on the Repo rate is taken by the Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India, taking into account various factors including the inflation and the state of the economy.
