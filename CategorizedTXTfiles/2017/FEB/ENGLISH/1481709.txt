      Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has been developing technologies, products and systems that are required for the Armed Forces. After the systems are trial evaluated and accepted by the Users, the technologies are transferred to production agencies for manufacture and supply to Users. Indigenous technologies developed by DRDO are available for transfer to Indian Industry. The process for transfer of indigenous technologies has been promulgated and a document tilted “DRDO Guidelines for Transfer of Technology” has already been issued.
