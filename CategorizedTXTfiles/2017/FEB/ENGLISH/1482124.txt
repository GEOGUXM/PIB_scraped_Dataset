    So far as the Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) under the Department of Heavy Industry (DHI) is concerned, they are incurring losses due to number of factors such as poor order book, shortage of working capital, surplus manpower, obsolete plant and machinery and difficulty to adjust to changing market conditions etc.
    
    The details of concessions and exemptions in r/o of CPSEs under DHI are as follows:
    
    • Cement Corporation of India (Rajban Unit in Himachal Pradesh) has been availing 100% excise duty exemption since 2010. It has availed excise duty concession amounting to Rs.7.37 crore and Rs.9.02 crore in the year 2014-15 and 2015-16 respectively.
