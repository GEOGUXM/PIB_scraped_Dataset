      Posted On: 02 FEB 2017 5:56PM by PIB Delhi


    The share of nuclear power in the total electricity generation in the country was about 3.4% in the year 2015-16.

    The share of nuclear power in total electricity generation is planned to be progressively increased by addition of nuclear power capacity. The present capacity of 5780 MW will reach 6780 MW by the end of this financial year, with the commercial operation of Kudankulam Unit-2, which is already generating infirm power at the rated capacity. The capacity is expected to reach 9580 MW by 2020 on progressive completion of projects under construction and about 12980 MW by 2024 on completion of new projects accorded sanction. A large expansion programme based on both indigenous technologies and with foreign technical cooperation is planned in future.

    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
