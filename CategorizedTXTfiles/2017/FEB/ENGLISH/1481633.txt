      Posted On: 02 FEB 2017 6:08PM by PIB Delhi


    The Kudankulam reactors deploy passive safety features, namely the Passive Decay Heat Removal System, additional system for Core Passive Flooding, Passive Filtering Systems, etc. Post Fukushima, a task force of NPCIL constituted for safety evaluation found KKNPP design to be safe. However, to enhance further the safety level, the task force suggested 17 recommendations, all of which have been implemented. These measures have already bolstered the safety systems and are the most current.


    A site at Haripur in West Bengal has been accorded ‘in principle’ approval by the Government for locating six units of 1000 MW or higher capacity in technical cooperation with Russian Federation. Subsequently, as an alternative to the Haripur Site, the possibility of a coastal site in the state of Andhra Pradesh is also being examined by the Site Selection Committee of the Government to locate nuclear power plants with Russian technical cooperation.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
