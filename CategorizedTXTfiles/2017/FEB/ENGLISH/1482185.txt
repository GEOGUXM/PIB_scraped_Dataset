    The Cauvery variety of coffee is more suitable for coffee cultivation in the Western Ghats areas and is not recommended for the coffee growing areas of Andhra Pradesh. ln order to improve the productivity in the coffee growing tribal areas of Andhra Pradesh, improved varieties like Sln.SA, Sln.5B and Sln.8 are being promoted by the Coffee Board as they have better adaptability to these areas. Besides, the Coffee Board has introduced various on-farm training programs and exposure visits to improve the coffee productivity in Andhra Pradesh.


    With the aim to give visibility to the coffee produced by the native tribal growers of Andhra Pradesh in the national/international markets, the Coffee Board has developed an exclusive logo under the brand name of "Araku valley". The Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC) of Government of Andhra Pradesh has already taken steps to market the coffee under the brand name 'Araku Valley'. Coffee Board is providing support for marketing of coffee by providing incentives @Rs.10 per kg of coffee marketed through designated channels. Besides, the Coffee Board has introduced incentives for organic certification of tribal coffee, so as to facilitate better market access and premium to the tribal growers.

    This information was given by the Commerce and Industry Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
