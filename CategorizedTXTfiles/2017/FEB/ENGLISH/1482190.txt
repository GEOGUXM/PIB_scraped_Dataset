      Export of Tea by Small Tea Growers
      Posted On: 08 FEB 2017 5:40PM by PIB Delhi


    Small tea growers in West Bengal and Kerala have shown their interest to export their produce to foreign countries on their own. So far four applications have been received in the Tea Board for issue of export license from organizations promoted by small tea growers and one registered small tea grower has been issued tea export licence.


    In order to motivate small tea growers to work as collectives by formation of self Help Groups (SHGs), financial assistance is provided under the Small Growers component of the “Tea Development & Promotion Scheme” being implemented by the Tea Board. The Self –Help Groups are encouraged to supply green leaf directly to the factory for better price realization. So far, 332 SHGs of small tea growers have been formed. Further, in order to encourage the small tea growers to have their own tea manufacturing factories and get better price for their produce, the Tea (Marketing) Control Order, 2003 has been amended and mini tea processing factories have been exempted from obtaining any registration/ no objection certificate.

    This information was given by the Commerce and Industry Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
