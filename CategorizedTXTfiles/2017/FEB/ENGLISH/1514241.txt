    An eight-member delegation of British Parliamentarians called on Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today.


    The Prime Minister said that the relations between India and UK have strong bipartisan support in both countries, and called for enhanced interactions between the Parliamentarians of both countries.


    The Prime Minister fondly recalled his own visit to UK in November 2015, and the visit of Prime Minister Theresa May to India in November 2016. The Prime Minister welcomed the celebration of 2017 as the India-UK Year of Culture.


    The Prime Minister also said that India and UK are natural partners in the global fight against terrorism, and urged the Parliamentarians to continue to raise their collective voice against terrorism, extremism and radicalization.
