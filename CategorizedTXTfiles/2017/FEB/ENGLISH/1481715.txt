This comprises 22 items of clothing in all, including trousers, jackets, gloves and sunglasses. The winter clothing provided to the jawans is designed to withstand extreme temperatures that even go below minus 50 degree Celsius.

      
      The kits provided are as per laid down specifications and no shortcomings have been reported. Upgradation and provision of improved version of winter clothing is a continuous process for which necessary steps are taken regularly.
      
      The soldiers deployed at places such as Siachen are being provided pre-fabricated insulated shelters (Fiber Reinforced Plastic) except at certain locations where due to terrain configuration and altitude, it is not possible to construct integrated shelters. The soldiers at such locations are provided with insulated tents to enable them to withstand extreme low temperatures.
