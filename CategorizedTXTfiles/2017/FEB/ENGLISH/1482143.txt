      Discount on Vacant Berths in Railways
      Posted On: 08 FEB 2017 4:20PM by PIB Delhi


    Occupancy of the trains varies during peak, non-peak, festivals seasons, special occasions and weekends etc. Therefore, sometimes the trains run with higher occupancy (more than the berth potential) and sometimes during non-peak times some berths remain vacant. Therefore, loss due to vacant berths in trains cannot be quantified. However, the average occupancy of all reserved accommodation on Indian Railways during 2015-2016 was 101% which has gone upto 102% in 2016-17 upto December, 2016.


    Some passengers plan their journey at last moment and have the option to travel through different modes of transport. Therefore, to promote such passengers to avail train services in which berths are vacant after the preparation of first chart, w.e.f. 01.01.2017, 10% rebate in basic fare on vacant berths/seats after preparation of first chart is given in the reserved class of all trains.


    W.e.f. 20.12.2016, 10% rebate in basic fare on vacant berths/seats after preparation of first chart is given in Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duronto trains on an experimental basis for six months. No assessment has been made till date.


    Apart from above, w.e.f. 20.12.2016 discounted fare has been offered for the passengers of Jaipur-Ajmer and Ajmer-Jaipur in 12015/12016 New Delhi-Ajmer Shatabdi Express and for the passengers of Bengaluru City-Mysuru and Mysuru- Bengaluru City in 12007/12008 Chennai Central-Mysuru Shatabdi Express.


    This Press Release is based on the information given by the Minister of State for Railways Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha on 08.02.2017 (Wednesday).
