    The meeting of Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on prices and availability of select essential commodities held on February 9, 2017 under the chairmanship of Secretary, Department of Consumer Affairs noted that for the first time a buffer stock of 10 lakh MT of pulses has been created through domestic procurement and imports. Of this, five lakh tonne have been procured during ongoing kharif marketing season. The Government procurement intervention has helped farmers get remunerative prices for kharif pulses. IMC directed procuring agencies to continue procurement operations for pulses at MSP plus bonus. Procurement and price support would incentivize farmers to take up cultivation of pulses on larger scale.
