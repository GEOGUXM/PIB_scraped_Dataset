    The Air Wing of Border Security Force (BSF) added a new chapter with the induction of its own pilots and crew today. Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju became the first dignitary to be flown by “all BSF” aircrew, aboard the MI-17 V5 helicopter from Guwahati. This is a significant achievement and shows the confidence and capability of managing its resources and expanding the operational envelop of recently inducted modern MI-17 V5 choppers. Wing Commander H.D. Lohani (Retd.) and Wing Commander S. Malik (Retd.) both appointed as Commandant/Pilot recently, were part of the crew for this historic occasion. Till now the BSF aircrafts were being operated by Aircrew from the Indian Air Force.
    
    Since its establishment in 1969, the Aviation Wing of MHA under BSF is touching new milestones with each passing day. Based at Safdarjung Airport in New Delhi, its span has now expanded to Ranchi & Guwahati. With this development, the BSF helicopters are now covering the entire length and breadth of the country, - from hills and forests of Arunachal Pradesh to the vast expanse of the “Rann of Kutch”. Their service has provided the much needed impetus in fight against the Naxals, as a result their activities have significantly reduced. This is due to a new synergy between aviation assets of MHA and its troops on ground.
