      Posted On: 02 FEB 2017 6:09PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government had accorded ‘in principle’ approval for the site at Kovvada in Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh for setting up six Light Water Reactors in cooperation with the USA. Pre-project activities including land acquisition, obtaining statutory clearances and detailed site investigations are continuing at the site. In parallel, discussions on the techno-commercial aspects with M/s Westinghouse Electric Company (WEC) to arrive at a project proposal have also started.

    The procedures involved in pre-project activities like land acquisition and obtaining environmental clearances take time. Similarly, negotiations with foreign technology partners involving various legal, regulatory, technical and commercial aspects also take time.

    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
