    Proposal has been recommended in principle by the Empowered Committee of the Nirbhaya Fund under Ministry of Women and Child Development subject to the condition that it would be considered in consultation with the Department of School Education, MHRD, if self defence training can be incorporated in the curriculum of girl’s school for classes between 4th to 9th. The scheme envisages extending funding support to States/UTs for launching programmes on self-defence training to women which includes basic and advanced training of persons from Government Schools, Colleges, Girls Students staying in hostels, hostels recognized by Social Welfare Department, women belonging to BPL, slum dwellers, students of Orphanage etc.
    
    ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ being State subjects, action with respect to maintenance of law and order lies primarily in the domain of the State Governments. Ministry of Home Affairs has issued advisories dated 04.09.2009, 22.04.2013 and 12.05.2015 to the State/UTs for taking steps to open all women police stations as per need, 24x7 women help desks in Police Stations and increase in the percentage of women in police force to 33%. These advisories are available on website of MHA at www.mha.nic.in.
    
    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question by Shri Kunwar Pushpendra Singh Chandel and Dr. Banshilal Mahato in the Lok Sabha today.
