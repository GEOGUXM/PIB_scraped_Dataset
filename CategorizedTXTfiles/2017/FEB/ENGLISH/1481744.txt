      Posted On: 03 FEB 2017 6:12PM by PIB Delhi


    The Ministry is implementing the scheme for setting up One Stop Centre since 1 st April 2015 to support women-affected by violence. The scheme aims to facilitate access to an integrated range of services including medical aid, police assistance, legal aid/case management, psycho-social counselling, and temporary support services to women affected by violence.


    Under the scheme, it has been envisaged that One Stop Centres would be set up across the country in a phased manner. In the first phase, one Centre was sanctioned per State/UT. Further, 150 additional Centres are taken up in second phase during 2016-17. The Ministry has approved all the proposals received from States/UTs. Out of these, 68 Centres have become operational.


    Funds of Rs.1102.49 lakhs and Rs.3555.87 lakhs have been sanctioned to States/UTs during 2015-16 and 2016-17 respectively for the setting up One Stop Centres.


    As these Centres have become operational recently, data regarding number of women assisted have been received only from States of Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh, Haryana, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Bihar and Uttarakhand. The details are as under:
