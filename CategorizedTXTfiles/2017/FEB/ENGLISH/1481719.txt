The scope of defence cooperation under this MoU includes Training and Exercises, Military Medical services, Military cultural, sports and adventure activities and any other field as may be agreed upon by both sides. As per MoU, such mechanisms as may be mutually agreed to, may be set up for the purpose of furthering the objectives of this MoU. At present, there is no proposal to set up a Joint Working Group (JWG) on defence and security cooperation.
