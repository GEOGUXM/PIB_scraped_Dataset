    The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and United States Geological Survey (USGS) has been signed on July 09, 2016 for cooperation in the exchange and use of satellite remote sensing data. Under this MoU, USGS is facilitating availability of data of Indian region using American remote sensing satellites viz. Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 to ISRO. ISRO is facilitating availability of data of US region using Indian remote sensing satellite ‘Resourcesat-2’ to USGS.


    The sharing of each other’s satellite remote sensing data provides enhanced frequency of earth observation data to both organisations. The AWiFS payload (onboard Resourcesat-2) enables USGS to acquire earth observation data every 5 days. The Landsat satellites enable ISRO to acquire multi-spectral earth observation data including thermal data. These data sets help both countries to carry out applications in the field of natural resources inventory & management and disaster management support.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
