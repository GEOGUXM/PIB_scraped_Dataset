      Crude Oil

      1. Crude oil production during January, 2017 was 3075.41 TMT which is 5.57% lower than target but 1.28% higher when compared with January 2016. Cumulative crude oil production during April, 2016 - January, 2017 was 30120.74 TMT which is 2.31% and 2.79% lower than target and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Unit-wise and state-wise crude oil production is given at Annexure-I. Unit-wise crude oil production for the month of January, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April, 2016 - January, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-1 and month-wise in Figure-1.

      Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production

      Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall have been given in following sub-sections:


      1.1 Crude oil production by ONGC during January, 2017 was 1916.25 TMT which is 5.07% lower than the monthly target but 4.63% higher when compared with January, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April, 2016 - January, 2017 was 18545.34 TMT which is 1.83% lower than target for the period and 0.88% lower than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      · Delay in deployment of MOPU-Sagar Samrat.


      · Delay in implementation of “Development of Western Periphery of MHS (ZC)” Project.


      · Natural decline & increase in water cut in matured fields of Western Offshore.


      1.2 Crude oil production by OIL during January, 2017 was 274.06 TMT which is 14.83% lower than monthly target but 5.26% higher than production in January, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April, 2016 - January, 2017 was 2704.51 TMT which is 4.60% lower than target for the period and 0.24% lower than production during corresponding period of last year. Shortfall in production was mainly due to l ess than planned contribution from high producing areas like Greater Hapjan, Greater Chandmari fields & Naharkatiya fields on account of rise in water cut and less than envisaged contribution from newly drilled wells.


      1.3 Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during January, 2017 was 885.10 TMT which is 3.42% lower than the monthly target and 6.33% lower than January, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April, 2016 - January, 2017 was 8870.89 TMT which is 2.58% lower than target for the period and 7.24% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      · RJ-ON-90/1: Liquid cut back in Mangala wells for rectification of 14" MPT to CPF feed water line leak from 27-28 January, 2017. NI wells shutdown for 3-phase separator line modification on 27-28.01.2017. Few high water cut wells closed at Mangala, poor reservoir performance of Bhagyam.


      · Natural Decline in Ravva & CB-OS/2.


      · Closure of 1 well in MA field in KG-DWN-98/3.


      Natural Gas


      2 Natural gas production during January, 2016 was 2738.37 MMSCM which is 10.19% lower than the target for the month but 11.89% higher when compared with January, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production during April, 2016 - January, 2017 was 26623.75 MMSCM which is 5.59% lower than target for the period and 1.92% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II. Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of January, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April, 2016 -January, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

      Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production

      2.1 Natural gas production by ONGC during January, 2017 was 1922.15 MMSCM which is 5.80% lower than the monthly target but 25.56% higher when compared with January, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC during April, 2016 - January, 2017 was 18342.44 MMSCM which is 2.25% lower than the cumulative target but 3.03% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year. Shortfall in production was mainly due to decline in reservoir pressure in Bassein field and less production from Daman & C-26 Cluster due to evacuation constraint as export lines to TCPP platform are not yet completed.


      2.2 Natural gas production by OIL during January, 2017 was 248.79 MMSCM which is 6.15% higher than the monthly target and 1.25% higher than January, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April, 2016 - January, 2017 was 2460.35 MMSCM which is 1.38% lower than the cumulative target but 4% higher than the production during the corresponding period of last year.


      2.3 Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during January, 2017 was 567.43 MMSCM which is 26.71% lower than the monthly target and 15.41% lower when compared with January, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April, 2016 - January, 2017 was 5820.97 MMSCM which is 16.15% lower than the cumulative target and 16.55% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      · Underperformance of wells in KG- OSN-2001/3.

      · Underperformance of Sohagpur West CBM block extended dewatering hampering production in Raniganj East CBM block.

      · Closure of 2 wells in D1D3 field in KG-DWN-98/3.

      · RJ-ON-90/1: Liquid cut back in Mangala wells for rectification of 14" MPT to CPF feed water line leak on 27-28.01.2017. NI wells shutdown for 3-phase separator line modification on 27-28.01.2017. Few high water cut wells closed at Mangala, poor reservoir performance of Bhagyam etc.

      · RJ-ON/6: Increase in Water cut in few wells.

      Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)

      3 Refinery production during January, 2017 was 21108.06 TMT which is 0.22% higher than the target for the month but 1.52% lower when compared with January, 2016. Cumulative production during April, 2016-January, 2017 was 204994.09 TMT which is 1.96% higher than the target for the period and 6.78% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III. Company-wise production for the month of January, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April, 2016 - January, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

      Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production

      3.1 PSU Refineries’ production during January, 2017 was 11760.82 TMT which is 1.57% lower than the target for the month and 2.90% lower than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by PSU refineries during April, 2016 - January, 2017 was 114517.58 TMT which is 0.99% higher than the target for the period and 10.04% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some PSU refineries are as under:

      · IOCL, Gujarat: Planned shutdown from Dec’16 to Jan’17wherein the replacement catalyst failed & new catalyst had to be procured.
      · IOCL, Paradip: Throughput is lower due to coke upliftment issue.
      · IOCL, Haldia: Throughput is lower due to VGO stock build-up.
      · IOCL, Digboi / Guwahati: Lower availability of Assam crude.
      · BPCL, Mumbai: Throughput lower than target due to failure of DHDS- RGC motor
      · BPCL, Kochi: Throughput lower than target due to total power failure on 10.01.2017.
      · MRPL, Mangalore: Throughput lower due to load restrictions in CDU -1 heater and CDU-3 Vacuum heater.

      3.2 Production in JV refineries during January, 2017 was 1519.98 TMT which is 15.06% higher than the target for the month and 7.09% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April, 2016 - January, 2017 was 14216.89 TMT which is 11% higher than the target for the period but 0.85% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year.


      3.3 Production in private refineries during January, 2017 was 7827.26 TMT which is 0.44% higher than the target for the month but 0.96% lower when compared with January, 2016. Cumulative production by private refineries during April, 2016 - January, 2017 was 76259.62 TMT which is 1.87% higher than the target for the period and 3.66% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year.


      3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of January, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April, 2016 - January, 2017 vis-à-vis April, 2015 - January, 2016 are given at Annexures-IV and V respectively.
