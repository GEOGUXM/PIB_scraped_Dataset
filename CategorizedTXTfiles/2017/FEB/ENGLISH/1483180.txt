    Ministry of Urban Development has set up a Gymnasium in Nirman Bhawan for the benefit of its employees for keeping them fit by doing physical exercises. Set up at a cost of Rs.5.00 lakh, the gymnasium will be open after office hours till 8.00 pm.

    This physical fitness facility was today inaugurated by the Minister of Urban Development Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu. He said on the occasion that “Physical fitness is the key to health and mental fitness which have a bearing on productivity. Such facilities at work places would go a long way in keeping employees fit in the fast paced and sedentary lives. I would expect the employees to make proper use of the facility”.


    Set up with financial support from the Department of Personnel and Training, the gymnasium is equipped with two treadmills, one recumbent bike, two cross trainers, one multi-gym, a flat bench, an inclined bench and dump bell sets. The facilities will be further expanded in due course.


    The Ministry which has about 500 employees of different categories is the first to have such full fledged work out facility.
