      Posted On: 08 FEB 2017 5:35PM by PIB Delhi


    T he annual production of spices in the country is around 6 million tonne, out of which 14% is exported while the rest is available for domestic consumption which is sufficient to meet the domestic demand. Government implements several programmes for increasing production and availability of spices such as Cardamom through the Spices Board and other spices through the State Horticulture Missions under the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH). While on one hand, programmes aimed at increasing production and ensuring remunerative prices to farmers through pre and post harvest management and support activities are undertaken, on the other hand, the industry is assisted through adoption of upgraded technology in spice processing, setting up of quality evaluation labs, quality certification and making them available for exports.


    This information was given by the Commerce and Industry Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
