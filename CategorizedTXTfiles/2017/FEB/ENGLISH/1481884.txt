      ABOUT SLNP


      Prime Minister Shri Naremdra Modi, has launched the Street Lighting National Programme (SLNP) on 5 th January, 2015 to attain significant savings by promoting LED based lighting. The scheme is being implemented by Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), a joint venture company of four Public Sector Undertakings under the Ministry of Power. There is no element of Government of India subsidy in the scheme. EESL has evolved a service model to enable municipalities to replace conventional lights with LEDs at no upfront cost. The resultant reduction in Energy and maintenance cost of the municipality is used to repay EESL over a period of time. The target is to install 3.5 crore LED street.

      lights in all the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) of the country by March, 2019, which will result in avoided capacity generation of 1500 MW and save 9 billion KWh per year. The benefits likely to be accrued to the country as a result of implementation of SLNP programme is as follows:
