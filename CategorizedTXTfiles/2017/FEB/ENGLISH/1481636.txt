      Posted On: 02 FEB 2017 6:10PM by PIB Delhi


    At present, the Site Selection Committee of the Government is exploring the possibility of identifying a suitable coastal site in Andhra Pradesh for locating nuclear power plants with Russian cooperation.

    Some sections of local people and certain groups have expressed their opposition to location of nuclear power plants near Kavali in Andhra Pradesh due to apprehensions about safety of the nuclear power plants and loss of traditional means of livelihood. An extensive public outreach programme (including public hearings and consultations) to spread awareness about nuclear power and all its related aspects based on a multipronged approach has been instituted in a structured manner.
    The Government of Andhra Pradesh has given its consent to carry out technical studies required to identify potential coastal sites for locating nuclear power plants in the state.

    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
