      Posted On: 08 FEB 2017 5:04PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government has accorded ‘in principle’ approval for the sites at Gorakhpur in Haryana and Mahi Banswara in Rajasthan for setting up 4 reactors of 700 MW each. The Government has also accorded financial sanction for Units 1 & 2 at Gorakhpur (GHAVP 1&2-2x700 MW) and work on the project has commenced.


    

    The nuclear power project at Gorakhpur, Haryana (GHAVP 1&2) is being set up by Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), a Public Sector Enterprise under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE).


    Sites for nuclear power plants are selected after carrying out extensive studies by specialised national agencies at the siting stage. The sites are recommended after these meet the criteria laid down in the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) code on Site Evaluation of Nuclear Facilities. The reactors to be set up are designed for possible impacts of natural and man-made events likely at the site to ensure safety of the personnel, public and environment.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
