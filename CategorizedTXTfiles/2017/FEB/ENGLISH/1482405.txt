    Union Minister of State (I/C) for Youth Affairs and Sports Shri Vijay Goel today inaugurated the first edition of the Akhil Bhartiya Kabaddi Championship at the Motilal Nehru School of Sports in Rai, Sonipat (Haryana). The competition aims at popularising the sport among youngsters and to promote it as a game of the masses. Haryana Sports Minister Anil Vij was also present at the inaugural ceremony.
    
    Speaking on the occasion Shri Goel said that the Kabaddi World Cup held recently in Gujarat was a unique event as not only India being the host country won the World Cup but the game was internationalised to a great extent. The minister said, his idea is to promote indigenous games among the youth and Kabaddi being one of the most prominent games as well as cost effective, we must take it to the next level.
    
    Shri Goel further stated that his Ministry will soon start off with Rural Games or “Grameen Khel Mahakumbh” under the ambitious Khelo India scheme to not only popularise rural games but also search for talented players at the grassroots level.
    
    The three days Kabaddi Championship has the prize money for the winning team of ₹1 crore. For the 2nd and 3rd position ₹ 50 lakh and ₹ 25 lakh respectively would be given. During the championship various cultural events will be organised depicting the rich heritage and sports culture of Haryana.
