    The Minister of State for Home Affairs Shri Kiren Rijiju inaugurated the programme on ‘Inner Strength and Disaster Resilience’ here today. The programme is being organised by National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar also graced the occasion.


    During the inaugural, Shri Kiren Rijiju said that the security forces always try to focus on the physical fitness and forget about their mental fitness. He said that there come certain situations, where along with physical strength, spiritual/mental strength is also needed to deal with.


    The Minister said that India is a country which is prone to disasters, both natural as well as manmade. NDRF is India’s professional emergency force to tackle disasters, he added. He said that disasters always pose a challenge to deal with. Shri Kiren Rijiju said that within a short span of 12 years, NDRF has become one of the dedicated forces in the country, which is being appreciated in India, as well as abroad. He said that NDRF has gained not only faith but also respect from the people and assured that the Government will support NDRF in all its endeavours.


    The DG, NDRF, Shri R K Pachnanda said that the NDRF is the specialised force in the country to handle disasters and so far NDRF has saved more than 5 million lives. He said that NDRF not only saves lives, but also educates people on how to tackle disasters. Over 47 lakh people have been trained as of now, he added.
