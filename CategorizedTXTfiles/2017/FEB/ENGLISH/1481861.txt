      Expansion of EPF Ambit
      Posted On: 06 FEB 2017 4:58PM by PIB Delhi


    To bring in more employees from public and private sector into the ambit of Employees’ Provident Fund Organization (EPFO), an Employees’ Enrolment Campaign, 2017 has been launched for the period 01.01.2017 to 31.03.2017.


    Under the campaign, an employer, whether already covered or yet to be covered, can enroll employees who remained un-enrolled for any reason between 01.04.2009 and 31.12.2016 by making a declaration of such employees during the campaign period. Such declaration shall be valid only in respect of employees who are alive as on 1st January, 2017 and no proceedings under section 7A of the Employees’ Provident Funds & Miscellaneous Provisions (EPF & MP) Act, 1952 or under paragraph 26B of the Employees’ Provident Funds (EPF) Scheme, 1952 or under paragraph 8 of the Employees’ Pension Scheme, 1995 have been initiated against their establishment or employer, as the case may be, to determine the eligibility for membership of such employees.


    Making Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) contribution optional for employees, inter-alia, envisages amendment to the EPF & MP Act, 1952 and Schemes framed thereunder which has not been done. Further, it has not been decided to raise the present wage ceiling for coverage under the EPF& MP Act, 1952.


    This information was given by Shri Bandaru Dattatreya, the Minister of State (IC) for Labour and Employment, in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
