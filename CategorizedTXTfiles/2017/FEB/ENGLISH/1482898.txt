The sample Villages/Urban wards are selected from the entire rural and urban areas of States/UTs and the survey is conduct by the States/UTs in three seasons. The list of latest Livestock Census villages constitutes the sampling frame. As per general principle, for the estimation of livestock numbers, 15% (5% for each season) of the villages/urban wards will be selected in the form of two independent sub-samples in a State for complete enumeration of livestock and poultry population by using Simple Random Sampling Without Replacement (SRSWOR). Subsequently, 5 samples will be selected from each of the sub-sample to carry out detailed survey for the estimation of yield rates. The number of sample will increase or decrease according to the number of villages in each district.
