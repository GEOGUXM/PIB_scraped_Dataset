      Posted On: 03 FEB 2017 5:42PM by PIB Delhi

      
    Indian Railways intends to redevelop ‘A-1’ and ‘A’ category stations on ‘as is where is’ basis, by inviting proposals from developers with their designs and business ideas. The facilities envisaged in redeveloped stations, inter alia, include improvement to approach infrastructure and segregation of arrival and departure of passengers which shall help in reducing congestion at stations and their approaches.


    Countries like Belgium, China, France, Germany, Malaysia and South Korea have shown interest in participating in the redevelopment of railway stations in India.


    Station redevelopment projects are intrinsically complex in nature and require detailed techno-economic feasibility studies to work out the cost. Therefore, cost of station redevelopment cannot be indicated at this stage.


    This Press Release is based on the information given by the Minister of State for Railways Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha on 03.02.2017 (Friday).
