    To understand the impact of demonetization on farming sector, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)-National Institute of Agricultural Economics and Policy Research (NIAP) conducted a short survey of farmers in few villages around Delhi under Mera Gaon Mera Gaurav (MGMG) initiative. Survey findings could not establish any significant adverse effect of demonetization on input availability, market arrivals of produce and area sown in Rabi season. As per preliminary reports received from the States, the total area sown under Rabi crops as on 27th January, 2017 stands at 637.34 lakh hectares as compared to 600.02 lakh hectares this time in 2016 indicating no significant impact of demonetization on Rabi sowing.


    In order to achieve the target of doubling of income of farmers by March 2022, the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare has constituted a Committee under the Chairmanship of Additional Secretary, for the following aspects:


    i) To study the current income level of farmers/ agricultural labourers


    ii) To measure the historical growth rate of the current income level


    iii) To determine the needed growth rate to double the income of farmers/agricultural labourers by the year 2021-22


    iv) To consider and recommend various strategies to be adopted to accomplish (iii) above


    v) To recommend an institutional mechanism to review and monitor implementation to realise
    the goal


    vi) To examine any other related issue.


    The Committee has held five meetings so far to evolve a suitable strategy.


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Shri Parshottam Rupala, in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
