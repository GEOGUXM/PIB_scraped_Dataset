      Rationalisation of Labour Laws
      Posted On: 06 FEB 2017 4:56PM by PIB Delhi


    Reforms in labour laws are an ongoing process to update legislative system to address the need of the hour and to make them more effective and contemporary to the emerging economic and industrial scenario. The Second National Commission on Labour which submitted its Report in 2002 had recommended that the existing Labour Laws should be broadly grouped into four or five Labour Codes on functional basis. Accordingly, the Ministry has taken steps for drafting four Labour Codes on Wages; Industrial Relations; Social Security & Welfare and Safety and Working Conditions, by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing the relevant provisions of the existing Central Labour Laws. These initiatives will reduce the complexity in compliance due to multiplicity of labour laws and facilitate setting up of enterprises and thus creating the environment for development of business and industry in the country and generating employment opportunities without diluting basic aspects of safety, security and health of workers.


    Conventions of International Labour Organization (ILO), on ratification create legally binding obligation for ratifying country. Ratification of a convention is a voluntary process. India ratifies a convention only when our national laws and practices are in full conformity with the Convention. So far, India has ratified 45 Conventions and 1 Protocol.


    This information was given by Shri Bandaru Dattatreya , the Minister of State (IC) for Labour and Employment, in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
