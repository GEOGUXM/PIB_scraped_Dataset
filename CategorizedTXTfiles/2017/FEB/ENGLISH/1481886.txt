    The Minister of State (I/C) for Petroleum & Natural Gas Shri Dharmendra Pradhan informed the Lok Sabha in a written reply today that i mplementation of PAHAL has resulted in identification of 3.34 crore and 3.56 crore ghost/fake/duplicate accounts during Financial Year 2014-15 and 2015-16 respectively. The total subsidy / under recovery on domestic LPG during the financial years 2014-15 and 2015-16 was Rs. 40569 crore and Rs 16074 crore, respectively. Lower subsidy during the last year is due to various factors, including introduction of direct transfer of subsidies into the accounts of consumers (PAHAL Scheme) and fall in international crude oil prices.

    As on 29.01.2017, 1,05,46,090 LPG consumers have voluntarily given up/ surrendered their LPG subsidy. Government has also issued a circular stating that the benefit of the LPG subsidy will not be admissible for the LPG consumers, if the consumer or his wife/her spouse had taxable income of Rs. 10 lakh and above during the previous financial year computed as per the income Tax Act 1961.
