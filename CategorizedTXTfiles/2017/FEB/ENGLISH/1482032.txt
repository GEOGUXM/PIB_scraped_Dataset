      Posted On: 07 FEB 2017 5:02PM by PIB Delhi


    Six firms including their allied and subsidiary firms are debarred from further business dealings with Ministry of Defence for a period of ten years w.e.f. 11.4.2012. Further, business dealings are suspended / put on hold in respect of 13 firms. In respect of another four firms, orders were issued restricting procurement from the concerned firms to cases where procurements are justified and necessary on the basis of operational urgency, national security and non-availability of other alternatives.


    Guidelines for penalties in business dealings with entities have been promulgated, which have come into effect from 21.11.2016. These guidelines have been promulgated to ensure probity, transparency, propriety and compliance in the defence procurement process. The guidelines are also aimed at ensuring fairness, impartiality, rigour and correctness in dealings with entities, keeping in view the overall security interests of the country.

    This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to ShrimatiSasikalaPushpa in Rajya Sabha today.
