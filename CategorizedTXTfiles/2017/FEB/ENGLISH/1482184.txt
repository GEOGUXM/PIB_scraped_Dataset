      The initiative to make Digital Payments a mass movement in India through NITI Aayog’s two incentive schemes – Lucky Grahak Yojana and DigiDhan Vyapar Yojana – has reaped huge dividends in just 45 days since its launch.
      Latest data from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which has been executing the schemes, shows that Rs.117.4 crore has been disbursed as reward money to over 7.6 lakh consumers and merchants, as on February 7, 2017. In addition to the daily cash backs to 15,000 consumers, 90 additional consumers and 3,000 merchants have won Rs1 lakh and Rs.50,000 each as weekly prize money for adopting digital mode of payments.
      The schemes have seen active participation from both males and females. The latest data shows that Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka have emerged as top five states with maximum number of winners. While majority of the winners are in the age group of 21 to 30 years, the diversity in their age group ranges from 15 to 66 years of age. The involvement of the elderly in the mass movement challenges the notion that they find it challenging to embrace technology to adopt digital payments.
      The winners of the two schemes are also seen as belonging to diverse socio-economic backgrounds, from farmers, merchants, small entrepreneurs, professionals, housewives to retired persons. An analysis of the reward data also reveals winners as belonging to a wide geographical cross-section, including rural and urban areas. It is interesting to note that the benefits of using digital payments have reached every part of India, with winners being spread across every State.
      Isham Singh, a 66 year-old farmer from the municipal committee of Assandh in Karnal, for instance, is a winner of Lucky Grahak Yojana for consumers. He was introduced to digital payments only a month before he won the lucky draw. Anshul Gangwar, a 23 year-old technician from Ahmedabad too won Rs 1,00,000 under the scheme. Mangesh Anantrao Jadhav, a 27 year-old police officer and proud supporter of digital payments from Nashik is another consumer who has won big for employing user-friendly methods of Digital Payments.
      Among merchants, R Durairaj, a daily needs store owner from Dharampuri district in Tamil Nadu, won Rs 50,000 as part of the weekly prize under Digi-Dhan Vyapar Yojana for merchants. Yashpal Darbi, a 37 year-old merchant of a small clothing store owner from Solapur, in Maharashtra too is a proud winner of Rs 50,000 under our Digi-Dhan Vyapar Yojana.
