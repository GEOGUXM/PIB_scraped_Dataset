      There is no vacancy of scientists in DRDO as on date. However, DRDO regularly recruits scientists for the posts which fall vacant due to superannuation/voluntary retirement.

      
      Regular recruitments through Advertisements, Campus Recruitments from Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), Indian Institute of Sciences (IISc) & National Institutes of Technology (NITs); and Lateral Entry, etc. are carried out as per the requirements to fill the existing vacancies.
      
      This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Dr. Ramesh Pokhriyal “Nishank” in Lok Sabha today.
