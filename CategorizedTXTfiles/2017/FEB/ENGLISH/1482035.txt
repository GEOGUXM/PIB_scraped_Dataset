      Raising Retirement Age of Doctors in the Armed Forces
      Posted On: 07 FEB 2017 5:04PM by PIB Delhi

      

    The retirement age of medical officers in the Armed Forces Medical Service (AFMS) is based on their rank, which ranges from 56 years in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel (& equivalent) to 60 years in case of Major General (& equivalent). In certain cases, Director General of AFMS in the rank of Lieutenant General and other Lieutenant Generals (& equivalent) may retire respectively at the age of 61 & 62 years.


    
    There is no proposal to equate the retirement age of medical officers of AFMS to those doctors working in the civil sector as the terms and conditions of service for the two categories of doctors are totally different.


    
    The present total authorised strength of AFMS is 7073 out of which 843 posts are vacant. Recruitment drives are conducted from time to time to fill up the vacancies.


    
    This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri Shrimati Chhaya Verma and Shri Vishambhar Prasad Nishad in Rajya Sabha today.
