    Air India has acquired 23 ‘Dreamliners’ progressively from September, 2012 to 9th January, 2017. The Dreamliner aircraft have experienced technical reliability issues, since induction into Air India fleet. These issues, however, do not adversely affect the safety of the airplane due to the system design and in-built system redundancy. Further, regular improvements are incorporated as a part of reliability enhancement process.
    
    One B787-8 aircraft will be delivered in July, 2017, two B787-8 aircraft in August, 2017 and the 27th B787-8 aircraft will be delivered in October, 2017.
    
    This information was given by the Minister of State for Civil Aviation Shri Jayant Sinha in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
