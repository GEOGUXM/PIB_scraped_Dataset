    Speaking on upgradation of Civil Aviation infrastructure , Shri Jaitley said that the Select airports in Tier 2 cities will be taken up for operation and maintenance in the PPP mode.

For transportation sector as a whole, including rail, roads, shipping, the Budget provides Rs. 2,41,387 crores in 2017-18. This magnitude of investment will spur a huge amount of economic activity across the country and create more job opportunities, the Finance Minister said in his Budget speech.


    Calling Telecom sector as an important component of the infrastructure eco-system, Shri Jaitley noted that the recent spectrum auctions have removed spectrum scarcity in the country. This will give a major fillip to mobile broadband and Digital India for the benefit of people living in rural and remote areas. Further, for the BharatNet Project , the allocation has been stepped up to Rs.10,000 crores in 2017-18 and 1,55,000 kms of Optical Fiber Cables have been laid.

A DigiGaon initiative will be launched to provide tele-medicine, education and skills through digital technology, he added.


    For strengthening our Energy sector , the Government has decided to set up Strategic Crude Oil Reserves. In the first phase, 3 such Reserve facilities have been set up and in the second phase, it is proposed to set up caverns at 2 more locations, namely, Chandikhole in Odisha and Bikaner in Rajasthan. This will take the country’s strategic reserve capacity to 15.33 MMT. Further, the Finance Minister, in his Budget speech, proposed to create an integrated public sector ‘oil major’ which will be able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies. In solar energy, the second phase of Solar Park development is proposed to be taken up for additional 20,000 MW capacity, Shri Jaitley added.

Over 250 investment proposals for electronics manufacturing have been received in the last 2 years, totaling to an investment of Rs.1.26 lakh crores. A number of global leaders and mobile manufacturers have set up production facilities in India, hence the Finance Minister said that allocation for incentive schemes like M-SIPS and EDF have been exponentially increased to an all-time high of Rs. 745 crores in 2017-18. Further, a new and restructured Central scheme, namely, Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) will be launched in 2017-18 to focus on our export infrastructure in a competitive world.
