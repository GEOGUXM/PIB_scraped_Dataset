    The Centralised Processing Centre (CPC) of the Income Tax Department (ITD) at Bengluru has already processed over 4.19 crore Income Tax Returns (ITRs) and issued over 1.62 crore refunds during the current financial year up to 10th February, 2017. The amount of refunds issued at Rs.1.42 Lakh Crore is 41.5% higher than the corresponding period last year.
    
    As a result of emphasis on expeditious issue of refunds, 92% of all Income Tax returns were processed within 60 days demonstrating CBDT’s commitment to faster and more efficient taxpayer service. Of the refunds issued, 92% are below Rs.50,000 due to the high priority given to expeditious issue of refunds to small taxpayers. Only 2% of refunds less than Rs. 50,000 are remaining to be issued. Majority of these cases relate to recently filed ITRs or where the taxpayer’s response to the Department is awaited.
    
    Taxpayers reposed faith in CBDT’s e-governance initiatives by filing electronically a whopping 4.01 Cr ITRs till 10th February 2017 representing an increase of 20% over the previous year. Also, more than 60 lakh other online forms were filed with an increase of nearly 41% compared to the previous year.
    
    Taxpayers are advised to verify and update their email address and mobile number on the e-filing website to receive electronic communication. CBDT is committed to ensuring best possible taxpayer services through its e-governance programs and increasing the coverage and scope of electronic filing and processing of various forms and applications.
