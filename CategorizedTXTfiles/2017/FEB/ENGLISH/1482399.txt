      Posted On: 09 FEB 2017 6:36PM by PIB Delhi

      

      The Minister of State (I/C) for Youth Affairs and Sports Shri Vijay Goel said in the Lok Sabha today that the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports is implementing the Khelo India – National Programmme for Development of Sports which inter-alia provides for construction of sports infrastructure such as synthetic surfaces for field of play, swimming pool and multipurpose halls, based on proposals received from State Governments/UTs.


      In the written reply he said, Sports Authority of India (SAI) has established 10 Regional Centres and 2 Educational Institutions and 287 SAI Sports Training Centres across the country. Presently, 13674 talented sports persons (Boys 9643 & 4031 Girls) are being trained. Details of SAI Regional Centres / institutions and Sports Training Centres are given in Annexure – I.


      For National athletes, who are preparing for participation in major international events, world level standards and specifications are provided. For schemes like SAI Training Centres (STCs) and Special Area Games (SAGs) which undertake talent identification and development to help the sportspersons to become national level athletes, appropriate training facilities are provided.


      In addition to the Regional Centres, institutions and SAI Sports Training Centres as per details given in Annexure – I, t he following Stadia in Delhi which were constructed/ renovated for the IX th Asian Games held at New Delhi in 1982 and subsequently renovated for the XIX th Commonwealth Games held at New Delhi in 2010 are being maintained and utilized by SAI:-

      1. Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium Complex
      2. Indira Gandhi Sports Complex
      3. Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Swimming Pool Complex (Formerly known as Talkatora Swimming Pool)
      4. Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium (Formerly known as National Stadium)
      5. Dr. Karni Singh Shooting Ranges (Formerly known as Shooting Range Tughlakabad)

      To strengthen the ongoing schemes of SAI and to identify more number of sportspersons, SAI has decided to establish the following Centres across the country:


      · Regional Centre at Nagpur


      · STC, Nagpur


      · SAG at Dandeli at Karnataka (for Siddi tribes)


      · SAG Centre in Kargil, Jammu & Kashmir


      · SAG, Lakshdweep


      · SAG Centre at Solal Gaon, North Lakhimpur, Assam


      Out of 27 approved Army Boys Sports Company (ABSC) Centres, 05 BSC Centres were established during 2015-16 and 5 additional BSC Centres in collaboration with Indian Army/Air Force/Navy are being established during 2016-17.


      To promote sports on single discipline basis, SAI has introduced National Sports Academy (NSA) scheme with state of the art sports facilities. The scheme is implemented in collaboration with concerned National sports federation and possibly through CSR partners. 10 such Academies in Swimming, Cycling, Athletics (Sprints), Cue Sports and Hockey in Delhi, Athletics (Middle and Long distance) at Bhopal, Athletics (Sprints and Jumps) and Golf at Thiruvananthapuram, Boxing at Rohtak, SAI Gopichand Badminton Academy at Hyderabad have already been established.


      The existing SAI Centre are reviewed on regular basis and necessary steps to upgrade the facilities inspite of the funds constraints are being taken from time to time.


      Since Sports Authority of India is consolidating its ongoing schemes /centres and also in view of the funds constraints the new proposals received from the state governments are not being considered for the time being.
