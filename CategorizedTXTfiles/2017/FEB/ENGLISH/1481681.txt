      #Approval for Operationalisation of Dialysis Unit at RIMS, JNIMS and Private Hospitals through PPP Model


      **State was approved 4 Dialyis machines previously. 2 functional in Aizawal and 2 would be functional in DH Lunglei.


      The Guidelines for Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Programme envisage provision of dialysis services under NHM in PPP (Public Private Partnership) mode.


      As per the guidelines, the private partner is to provide medical human resource, dialysis machine along with Reverse Osmosis (RO) water plant infrastructure, dialyzer and consumables, while the space, power, and water supply within District Hospitals is to be provided by the State Government.


      Immediately after announcement in Union Budget 2016-17, based on study of relevant models on dialysis services being operated under PPP mode in States and consultation with experts in this field as well as private service providers, the guidelines including model Request for Proposal (RFP) were developed and released on 7th April 2016 itself. Thereafter all States were requested to incorporate proposal in their NHM Programme Implementation Plans. As on date, approval has been provided to all States.


      The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
