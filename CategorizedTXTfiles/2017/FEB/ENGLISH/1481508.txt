    • Contributions have been asked from the Public Sector Undertakings for the National Sports Development Fund so as to enhance the sports activities and promotion of players.


    • A talent search portal is being launched for identification and nurturing of sporting talent in the country. To start with, a sum of Rs. 50 lakh has been kept for this purpose. Funds have been separately designated for nurturing and developing sports talent.
