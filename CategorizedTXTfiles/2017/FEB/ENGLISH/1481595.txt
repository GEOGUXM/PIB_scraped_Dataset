    Sixteen PRAGATI meetings have been held since inception of PRAGATI meeting from 25.03.2015 till 31.12.2016.


    PRAGATI aims at Pro-Active Governance and Timely implementation. The meeting provides a robust platform for clear understanding of the bottlenecks and issues involved in such projects/programme and for evolving measures for taking them ahead. Through such review meetings, various projects, public grievances, and programmes and schemes are discussed in detail and measures for fast tracking the same are evolved and implemented.


    The monitoring is project and programme specific, not state specific.
