      Action against Soft Drinks Companies for Toxic Contents in their products
      Posted On: 07 FEB 2017 1:29PM by PIB Delhi


    Samples of food items are picked up for testing and analysis by the State/UT Food Safety Departments from time to time. Separate data about samples of soft drinks having been tested/found not conforming to specified standards, has not been compiled centrally. A study was conducted by the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health (AIIP&PH) and the National Test House (NTH), Kolkata, in which AIIH&PH collected 4 bottles each of the cold drink brands (Sprite, Coca Cola, Mountain dew, Pepsi and 7 UP) and tested for heavy metals antimony, lead, chromium and cadmium and DEHP. The study takes bottled (packaged) water as the reference point. Since a number of other substances are added while making soft drinks, its composition will be different from packaged drinking water. The details of the findings of the study are given below:
