      Border Incursions along Mcmohan Line
      Posted On: 07 FEB 2017 4:58PM by PIB Delhi

      

    There have been no instances of incursions along our border with China. However, as there is no commonly delineated Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China, there are areas along the border where India and China have differing perception of LAC. Due to both sides undertaking patrolling upto their perception of the LAC, transgressions do occur.


    
    To resolve such issues, there is a well established mechanism of Border Personnel Meetings (BPMs), flag meetings, Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) and diplomatic channels wherein they are guided by provisions of various agreements between India and China.


    
    This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Dr. Vinay P. Sahasrabuddhe in Rajya Sabha today.
