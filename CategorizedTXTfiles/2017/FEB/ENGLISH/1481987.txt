      Specialized Palliative Care Units
      Posted On: 07 FEB 2017 1:30PM by PIB Delhi

    There is no state-wise/national data maintained under National Program for Palliative Care (NPPC) which suggest the number of specialized palliative care units established in India from 2010-2016 as the support under the Program to the States/UTs is primarily for establishing basic palliative care services at district hospitals.

    The Ministry had constituted an expert group on Palliative care which submitted its report ‘Proposal of Strategies for Palliative Care in India’ in November, 2012. On the basis of the Report, National Program for Palliative Care (NPPC) was implemented under National Health Mission (NHM). NPPC is now part of the ‘Mission Flexipool’ of NHM. A model PIP, a framework of operational and financial guidelines, for the states was also drafted on the basis of which the states/UTs prepare their proposals related to Palliative Care and incorporate them in their respective PIPs to seek financial support under NHM. The details of funds provided to the States/UTs from 2013-14 onwards till date under NPPC programme is given below:
