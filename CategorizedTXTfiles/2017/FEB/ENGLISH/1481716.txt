      Posted On: 03 FEB 2017 4:45PM by PIB Delhi

      For the redressal of grievances of the Armed Forces personnel, procedures have been clearly laid down in The Army Act, 1950; The Navy Act, 1957; and The Air Force Act, 1950. Further, the procedures for dealing with non-statutory representations / complaints have been laid down by the regulations and orders issued on the subject.
      
      There are also informal mechanisms in place for redressal of grievances in the Armed Forces like the sainik sammelans, personal interviews, suggestion boxes, informal meetings, open forum on Air Force internet etc.
      
      A web based Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) has been designed and implemented in all the Ministries / Departments of Government of India including the Department of Defence. This system provides online access to all including the Armed Forces personnel to lodge their grievances with the Ministry of Defence. The CPGRAMS system allows the Ministry to monitor the grievances and ensure their time bound redressal by the concerned organisations / institutions of the Ministry.
      
      Thus well laid out grievance redressal systems are in place to deal with the statutory and non-statutory complaints/grievances of the Armed Forces personnel.
      
      This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri M. Chandrakasi in Lok Sabha today.
