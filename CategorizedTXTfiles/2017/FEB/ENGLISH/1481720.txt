      For avalanche warning, 56 High Altitude Observatories and 55 Automatic Weather Stations have been set up by DRDO in Uttarakhand, Himachal and J&K. Further, mountain weather and avalanche related forecast specific for Army personnel is drawn by DRDO from its five Avalanche Mitigation Centres.
      
      Presently, DRDO is working on four projects to develop new technologies for more accurate prediction of avalanches.
