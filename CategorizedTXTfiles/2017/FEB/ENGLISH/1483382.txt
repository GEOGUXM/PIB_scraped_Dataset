    The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee has condoled the passing away of Shri P. Shiv Shankar.


    In a condolence message to his wife, Dr. P. Lakshmibai, the President has said, “I am sad to learn about the passing away of your husband, Shri P. Shiv Shankar, a friend and colleague for long years.


    A veteran Parliamentarian, Shri Shiv Shankar made a valuable contribution to Indian politics in his various capacities including as Union Cabinet Minister, Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission and as Governor of Sikkim as well as Kerala. He was associated with a large number of social and educational institutions. I have fond memories of my interactions with him. In his death, the nation has lost an eminent public figure, who shall always be remembered for his selfless service to his people.


    Please accept my heartfelt condolences and convey my deepest sympathies to the members of your family. I pray to the Almighty to give your family the strength and courage to bear this irreparable loss”.
