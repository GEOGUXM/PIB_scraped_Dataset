      Posted On: 02 FEB 2017 5:55PM by PIB Delhi


    Proposals for setting up of ten indigenous Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors each of 700 MW and two Light Water Reactors each of 1000 MW (Kudankulam Units-5&6) with foreign cooperation have been prepared and finalised. These are presently under consideration of the Government for accord of administrative approval and financial sanction.

    Presently two Central Public Sector Enterprises viz. Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) and Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam Limited (BHAVINI) are involved in nuclear power generation. In addition, the Government has amended the Atomic Energy Act, 1962 to facilitate establishment of Joint Venture Companies (JVC) by NPCIL with other Central Public Sector Undertakings to set up nuclear power plants.

    Government does not propose to allow private sector to enter into the nuclear power sector.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
