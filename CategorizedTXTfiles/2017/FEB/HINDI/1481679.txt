    In his Independence Day speech on 15 th August, 2003 the then Honâ€™ble Prime Minister had announced the setting up of six AIIMS type hospitals under Pradhan MantriSwasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY). The scheme was approved in March 2006.

    The primary objective of PMSSY is to correct the region imbalances in availability of affordable/reliable tertiary level healthcare in the country in general, and, to augment facilities for quality medical education in under-served or backward States, in particular.


    In addition to setting up of AIIMS, PMSSY also envisaged up-gradation of several existing Government Medical Colleges/Institutions in different states in the country.


    Apart from declaration of six AIIMS in 2003, the PMSSY scheme has been enlarged to encompass setting up of many other AIIMS at different states and also upgradation of existing Government Medical Colleges/Institutions (GMCIs) in different states. At present, setting up of 19 AIIMS and upgradation of existing 71 GMCIs has been undertaken under PMSSY.Under PMSSY scheme various activities have been undertaken since its inception without any discontinuation of the process.


    The State-wise details of works undertaken under PMSSY is given below:
