      Posted On: 19 SEP 2017 8:53PM by PIB Bhubaneshwar


    Siachen, the highest battlefield in the world, is a place where everything is ferried from the hinterland. It is a logistics challenge to move all types of waste out of the glacier so that these do not become environmental hazard.


    Since October 2014, when Swachch Bharat Abhiyan commenced, Siachen troops have removed and sent back more than 63 tons of garbage to the Base. These loads of garbage include packing material, barrels and perishables. On arrival of the trash to disposal areas, these are buried in deep trenches dug mechanically in areas which are not on run of the rivers and where landmass is not fragile.


    A huge amount of garbage has been brought back through man-pack loads, porters, ponies and sometimes returning helicopter ferries. Army continues to take steps to ensure hygiene at the highest battle field as hither to fore.
