    The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has condoled the passing away of the Marshal of Indian Air Force, Arjan Singh. In a message, he said that the Marshal was famous for his role in the 1965 India-Pakistan war and an icon of the Indian military history. The Panagarh air base in West Bengal would be called Air Force Station Arjan Singh and he was the only living officer to have a base named after him, he added.


    Following is the text of Vice President's message :


    "I am deeply grieved to hear about the sad demise of the Marshal of Indian Air Force, Arjan Singh, India's oldest, five-star ranked air force officer.


    The Marshal of the Air Force was famous for his role in the 1965 India-Pakistan war. An icon of the Indian military history, the then Chief of Air Staff Arjan Singh had led a young Air Force into the war in 1965 when he was hardly 44 years of age.


    In 2016, the Indian Air Force named its Panagarh (West Bengal) air base after Arjan Singh on the occasion of his 97th birth anniversary. The Panagarh base would be called Air Force Station Arjan Singh. He was the only living officer to have a base named after him.


    I convey my deepest condolences to the bereaved members of the family and join the nation in praying for eternal peace for the departed soul."
