    Defence Secretary Shri Sanjay Mitra administered Swachhta Shapath to officers and staff of Ministry of Defence here today. It is part of ‘Swachhta Hi Sewa’ campaign organised by Ministry of Defence from September 15 to October 2, 2017. It may be noted that the Prime Minister in his ‘Mann ki Baat’ on August 27, 2017 had appealed to the nation to focus on cleanliness and create an environment of cleanliness across the country in the spirit of Jan Andolan (people’s movement).
    
    Defence Ministry has come up with an action plan for overall cleanliness drive in and outside South Block and Sena Bhawan during the 18-day campaign. It includes arrangement of dustbins at prominent places for segregating biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste; discarding of old junks; cleaning of parking lots, corridors, staircases, and lifts in both the buildings. The campaign also includes competition on poem, slogan and essays on Swachh Bharat Mission.
