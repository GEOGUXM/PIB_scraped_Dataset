    Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) has supplied 80 per cent steel required for construction of the Sardar Sarovar Project inaugurated by the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi today. Once again partnering in one of the most prestigious and important national projects, SAIL supplied around 85,000 tonnes of steel (TMT) for the entire Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd. (SSNNL) project, which comprises all the canals throughout Gujarat, which are connected to Narmada River and Dam. Sardar Sarovar project is the second largest concrete gravity dam (by volume) and has the world's third largest spillway discharging capacity.
    
    The Sardar Sarovar Dam is a gravity dam built on Narmada river near Navagam, Gujarat, which will benefit four Indian states namely Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharastra and Rajasthan. A part of the Narmada Valley Project, it will help in irrigation and electrical power supply. It is a part of a large hydraulic engineering project involving the construction of a series of large irrigation and hydroelectric multi-purpose dams on the Narmada river. One of the 30 dams planned on river Narmada, Sardar Sarovar Dam (SSD) is the largest structure to be built. The project will irrigate more than 18,000 m2 (190,000 sq ft), most of it in drought prone areas of Kutch and Saurashtra. The total installed capacity of the power facilities is 1,450 MW.
    
    SAIL has been supplying steel for many prestigious projects taken by the Government for fast- paced infrastructure development of the country.
