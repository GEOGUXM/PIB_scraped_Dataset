    S Aishwarya and S Saundarya, great grand-daughters of Bharat Ratna M.S. Subbulakshmi, today called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with their parents, V Shrinivasan and Geetha Shrinivasan.


    Ms. Aishwarya and Ms. Saundarya briefly performed the "Maithreem Bhajatha." This is a benediction which was also rendered by M.S. Subbulakshmi herself in October 1966, at the United Nations.


    The benediction was composed in Sanskrit by Acharya Shri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati of Kanchi.


    It is an anthem for universal friendship and world peace, which was sung by M.S. Subbulakshmi, in most of her subsequent concerts, after the UN concert. It ends with the words “Srey o bhooyat sakala jananam” - Let grace and happiness abound for all mankind.
