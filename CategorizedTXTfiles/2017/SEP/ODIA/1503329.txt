    An award ceremony based on ‘SWACHHTA’ Ranking 2017 of Higher Educational Institutions was held in New Delhi today. Union Human Resource Development Minister, Shri Prakash Javadekar gave away the prizes to the awardees.


    Shri Prakash Javadekar congratulated the awardees of ‘SWACHHTA’ Ranking- 2017 of Higher Educational Institutions. Speaking on the occasion, the Minister said that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is the most significant cleanliness campaign by the Government of India. Under this mission more than four crore and eighty lakhs toilets were constructed in India since 2 nd October, 2014 and more than two lakhs villages are now open defecation free.


    The Minister said the students are cleanliness ambassadors and along with the support of people and institutions they will lead the vision of Clean India of our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. He also said to make Higher Educational Institutions a smart campus, we should focus on cleanliness as well as waste management. Save water, save electricity, promote cleanliness and manage waste to become smart campus.Shri Javadekar praised the efforts made by the various departments of Ministry of HRD for organising such ranking system which is in line with SwachhBharat Mission and contributing toward a cleaner India. He said, we should participate in these programmes to inform others too.


    An exercise to rank Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) on the basis of cleanliness and hygiene has been undertaken and concluded. Parameters for a clean campus were formulated, like student/toilet ratio, kitchen hygiene, availability of running water, modernity of toilet & kitchen equipment, campus green cover, garbage disposal in hostels and academic buildings, disposal techniques, water supply systems and also a certain weightage to whether the institutions has adopted any neighbouring locality or village to spread awareness & activities in Swachhta.


    About 3500 HEIs responded to the online invitation, submitting all their details as per format. The top 174 institutions were shortlisted as per criteria and officials from UGC and AICTE inspected the premises of all 174 institutions. Finally, the top 25 institutions across various categories like Universities, Technical Institutions, Colleges and Government institutions were selected and they were awarded on the occasion. This exercise will help generate peer pressure amongst institutions in the all important area of cleanliness.


    Clusters of villages have been adopted by certain HEIs under the Unnat Bharat Abhiyan programme in consultation with District Collectors. All Collectors and HEIs under the programme were invited to participate in the Best Collector & HEI Award by converting, before 31 st August 2017, One Village into Open Defecation Free, with solid and liquid waste facility. Many participated in the exercise and finally, 5 districts completed the exercise – Medak, Jhabua, Warangal, Ajmer and Indore. The Collectors made presentations in MHRD on 5 th September 2017 on their achievement. Those 5 Collectors along with the HEIs assisting them were awarded on the occasion.
