     2. EDP Training content needs to be more relevant and rigorous. On line EDP could be encouraged.
     3. Content partnership/Integration with MOOCs (Massive Open Online Coursewares) of recognized reputational technical and managerial institutes (such as IITs and IIMs)
     4. Agencies could consider hiring interns from leading management institutions (India/Abroad) to further handholding of beneficiaries
     5. Integration with Aadhar to authenticate the trainee identity and progress.
     6. For motivating beneficiaries to repay loans – The people whose Margin Money has been successfully adjusted, need to be rewarded with an option of 2nd round of subsidized loans (at say 15% of subsidy).
     7. Enforcement of deadlines (either of 60 or 90 days) on banks to decide about decision (acceptance or rejection) of the loan application

    viii. Cash credit account (CCA) component of the loan could be reduced. Maximum CCA may range up to 40% of total loan.
