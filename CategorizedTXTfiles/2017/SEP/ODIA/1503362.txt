    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind has written to Shri Arvind Singh, son of Marshal Arjan Singh, conveying his condolences on the passing away of Marshal Arjan Singh.
    
    In his message, the President has said, “I am extremely saddened to learn about the passing of our great and cherished air warrior and Marshal of the Indian Air Force Arjan Singh, DFC.
    
    Marshal of the Indian Air Force Arjan Singh was a hero of World War II and won our nation's gratitude for his military leadership in the War of 1965. He served the nation with distinction and was the first and only officer of the Indian Air Force who was honoured with the five-star rank as Marshal of the Air Force.
    
    For generations of our fellow citizens, Marshal of the Air Force Arjan Singh has remained a living legend. His service to the nation continued even outside uniform, as Lt. Governor of Delhi, Ambassador of India to Switzerland and the Vatican, High Commissioner to Kenya and Member of the National Commission for Minorities. For his services and achievements, he was honoured with numerous awards including the Padma Vibhushan.
    
    Please accept my heartfelt condolences and convey these to other members of your family as well as the Indian Air Force community. I pray to the Almighty to give you and your family the strength and courage to bear this irreparable loss. The nation mourns with you”.
