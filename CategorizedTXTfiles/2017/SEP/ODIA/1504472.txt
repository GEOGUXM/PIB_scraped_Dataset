    As part of their Valedictory Session as Assistant Secretaries, IAS officers of the 2015 batch today made presentations before the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi.
    
    8 selected presentations on various themes of governance were made by the officers, on themes such as rapid response for accident victims, tracking individual carbon footprints, financial inclusion, improving rural incomes, data driven rural prosperity, heritage tourism, railway safety, and central armed police forces.
    
    Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that it was indeed significant that the junior-most and senior-most officers are spending such a lot of time communicating with each other. The Prime Minister said that the young officers must imbibe all the positives from these interactions. The Prime Minister asked young officers to focus on subjects such as GST implementation and boosting digital transactions, especially via the BHIM App.
    
    He urged all officers to speed up the adoption of Government e- Marketplace (GeM) in their respective departments. He said this would eliminate middlemen, and result in savings for the government.
    
    Giving examples of ODF targets and rural electrification, the Prime Minister urged the officers to work towards 100 per cent achievement of targets. He urged the officers to work towards creating the India of the dreams of freedom fighters, by 2022. He said that officers who have risen from humble backgrounds, should meet young students, and motivate them. Communication leads to compassion, the Prime Minister added.
    
    He said that the key aim of officers today is the welfare of the nation and its citizens. He urged the officers work with team spirit, and make teams wherever they go.
