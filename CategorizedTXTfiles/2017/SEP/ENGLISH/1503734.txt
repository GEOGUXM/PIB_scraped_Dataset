      Posted On: 22 SEP 2017 2:26PM by PIB Delhi


    Department of Telecommunications has formulated guidelines for settlement of claims for compensation on accidents applicable to this Department and its PSUs so that the compensation to the family of the victims can be paid directly by the authorities without the intervention of the Courts. The guidelines have been effectuated from 01.12.2016.


    The guidelines provide for a compensation of Rs.10 Lakh in case of death or permanent disability resulting loss of both limbs and Rs.7 Lakh in case of other permanent disabilities in the event of any accident resulting solely and directly from any unintended and unforeseen injurious occurrence caused during the maintenance, operation and provisioning of any public services undertaken by this Department and its PSUs. This compensation will be in addition to the existing provisions of compensation under various welfare legislations.


    A Junior Administrative Grade(JAG) Officer or equivalent has been designated for the purpose of receiving and processing claims for compensation as per the prescribed procedure mentioned in the guidelines and to dispose of the same within 30 days in any case. In case where no application is received from the victim (any person who suffers permanent disablement or dies in an accident as defined in the guidelines)/dependents of victim, the Designated Officer may on receipt of the detailed accident report proceed suo-moto to initiate the process for consideration for grant of the compensation to the victim/dependents of victims. Detailed guidelines can be downloaded from the Departmentâ€™s website www.dot.gov.in .
