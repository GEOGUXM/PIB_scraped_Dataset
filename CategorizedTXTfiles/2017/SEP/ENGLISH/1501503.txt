    NHAI achieved the first milestone in Electronic Toll Collection when it operationalised one dedicated FASTag lane at all toll plazas from today. Now FASTag enabled vehicles can cruise through the dedicated FASTag lane without stopping at toll plazas on National Highways.

    
    The FASTag is an RFID tag available both online and offline through banks and Common Service Centres. Two mobile applications were launched by NHAI on 17th August, 2017,for ease of obtaining FASTags, which have received tremendous response. Thousands of road users have downloaded the applications and purchased FASTags in less than two weeks. The penetration of FASTag has increased to 18 % as on 31st August, 2017.
    
    The Government of India has mandated that new vehicles being sold with effect from 1st October, 2017 will be affixed with active FASTag. The “FASTag Partner App” will facilitate more than 6000 dealers in the country to access a single platform and activate the FASTag at the time of delivery of vehicle.
    
    NHAI has also launched massive awareness campaign to make road users aware of the FASTag and its benefits. NHAI officers have been tasked to visit toll plazas personally and ensure operationalisation of single dedicated Electronic Toll Collection lane. NHAI plans that as penetration of FASTag increases, more and more lanes will be dedicated to ETC.
