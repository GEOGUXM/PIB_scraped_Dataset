      Posted On: 29 SEP 2017 4:03PM by PIB Delhi


    The ongoing and targeted projects of National Highways Authority of India would generate estimated employment of approximately 50 crores man days over the next four years on a seasonal basis. This would be averaging to nearly 12.5 crore man-days yearly from 2018-2022. Of this, about 1.0 crore will be professional man-days, 3.5 crore skilled labour man-days and 8.0 crore semi-skilled and un-skilled man days.


    The NHAI currently has 282 projects having length of about 20,000 km under implementation across the country out of which 10,000 km of length is targeted to be completed over next one to two years. There are around 220 projects having length of about 31,000 km which are targeted to be awarded and completed in the next 3 to 4 years across all the States in the country under NHDP and Bharat Mala Schemes. Thus, NHAI plans to construct approximately 50,000 km Highways in next 4 years.


    This will generate seasonal employment opportunities as successful and efficient execution of projects invariably requires qualified professionals, skilled and semi-skilled work force.


    In order to meet the requirement of professionals, skilled and semi-skilled work force, NHAI has undertaken an elaborate exercise for Skill Development. The Chairman, NHAI Shri Deepak Kumar, held a meeting with the officers of Ministry of skill Development and Entrepreneurship to chalk out the road map for skilling of professionals, skilled and semi-skilled workers. Various issues connected with the Skill Development were discussed in the meeting. The Chairman, NHAI asked the officers of Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship to submit detailed plan of Skill Development in tune with the requirement of NHAI projects. The plan would be finalized in discussion with the concerned stakeholders.
