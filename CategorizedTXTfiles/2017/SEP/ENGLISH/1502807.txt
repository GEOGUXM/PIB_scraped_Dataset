The index for ‘Manufacture of Beverages’ group rose by 1.4 percent to 119.1 (provisional) from 117.4 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of bottled mineral water (5%), aerated drinks/soft drinks (incl. soft drink concentrates) (4%), rectified spirit (2%) and wine, beer and country liquor (1% each). However, the price of spirits (1%) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Textiles’ group declined by 0.6 percent to 112.7 (provisional) from 113.4 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of cotton yarn (2%) and synthetic yarn and manufacture of other textiles (1% each). However, the price of texturised & twisted yarn (1%) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Wood and of Products of Wood and Cork ‘ group rose by 0.3 percent to 132.1 (provisional) from 131.7 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of wooden panel (2%) and wooden board (non-electrical), plywood block boards, wooden block-compressed or not, timber/wooden plank, sawn/resawn and wooden splint (1% each). However, the price of wood cutting, processed/sized and particle boards (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Printing and Reproduction of Recorded Media ‘ group rose by 0.5 percent to 144.3 (provisional) from 143.6 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of printed form & schedule (6%), printed books and newspaper (2% each). However, the price of hologram (3d) (6%) and journal/periodical and sticker plastic (2% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Other Non-Metallic Mineral Products’ group declined by 0.8 percent to 111.9 (provisional) from 112.8 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of porcelain sanitary ware (10%), ceramic tiles (vitrified tiles) (7%), clinker (5%), marble slab (2%) and ordinary portland cement, pozzolana cement, granite, toughened glass, plain bricks and stone, chip (1% each). However, the price of graphite rod (13%), slag cement (6%), ordinary sheet glass (4%), non ceramic tiles (3%) and poles & posts of concrete, porcelain crockery, white cement, asbestos corrugated sheet and glass bottle (2% each) and cement blocks (concrete) (1%) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Electrical Equipment’ group rose by 0.8 percent to 109.3 (provisional) from 108.4 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of electric switch and electrical resistors (except heating resistors) (9% each), fibre optic cables (7%), domestic gas stove and electric accumulators (6% each), insulating & flexible wire, solenoid valve, geyser and incandescent lamps (3% each), electric heaters, light fitting accessories, electric filament type lamps and generators & alternators (2% each) and aluminium wire, fan, connector/plug/socket/holder-electric, lead acid batteries for vehicles & other uses, washing machines/laundry machines, electric welding machine, meter panel and flourescent tube (1% each). However, the price of dry cells such as torch light batteries (9%), amplifier (8%), microwave oven (5%), batteries (4%), electric switch gear control/starter (2%) and rotor/magneto rotor assembly, pvc insulated cable, insulator, electrical relay/conductor, electric wires & cables and refrigerators (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Machinery and Equipment’ group rose by 0.3 percent to 108.4 (provisional) from 108.1 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of pressure vessel and tank for fermentation & other food processing (9%), solar power system (solar panel & attachable equipment), packing machine and roller and ball bearings (4% each), manufacture of bearings, gears, gearing and driving elements (3%), conveyors - non-roller type, roller mill (raymond), air filters and rice mill machinery (2% each) and machinery used in the milling industry, oil pump, drilling machine, machinery for plastic products-extruded, pump sets without motor, gasket kit, agriculture implements and open end spinning machinery (1% each). However, the price of precision machinery equipment/form tools (6%), printing machinery (5%), chillers and separator (4% each), excavator, injection pump and chemical equipment & system (3% each), harvesters and pharmaceutical machinery (2% each) and grinding or polishing machine, lathes and agricultural tractors (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Motor Vehicles, Trailers and Semi-Trailers’ group rose by 0.7 percent to 111.9 (provisional) from 111.1 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of piston ring/piston and compressor (4%), cylinder liners and minibus/bus (3% each), wheels/wheels & parts (2%) and shafts of all kinds, body (for commercial motor vehicles), radiators & coolers and engine (1% each). However, the price of chassis of different vehicle types (2%) and steering gear control system, release valve and silencer and damper (1% each) declined.
