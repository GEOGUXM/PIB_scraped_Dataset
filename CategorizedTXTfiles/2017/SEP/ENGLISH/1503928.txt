    The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will address Valedictory Session of the Assistant Secretaries (IAS-2015 batch) here tomorrow. This is the third batch of IAS Officers to have commenced their career with a stint in the Central Government.


    All the 175 Officers were designated and posted as Assistant Secretaries by the Government of India in 42 Ministries (58 Departments) of the Central Government for three months from July 03, 2017 to September 29, 2017 after their Phase-II training at the Lal Bahadur Shashtri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie.


    During their three-month central deputation they were provided a holistic overview of the functioning of the Central Government through individual projects, group projects, concurrent review of projects suggested by earlier batches with a view to providing exposure of office functioning of Government of India to the young IAS officers at a very early stage in their career.


    The Officers were assigned important desks related to Policy and Flagship Programmes of the concerned Ministries and Departments. They were groomed by mentoring from nine sectoral Groups of Secretaries. The Assistant Secretaries made presentations of the key learning before their Mentor Groups where 35 presentations were shortlisted. Eight of the shortlisted 35 have been selected for presentations to be made before the Prime Minister.


    The objective of this Initiative is to provide exposure of Government of India functioning to the IAS officers at a very early stage in their career. As primary implementers in the field, this exposure also facilitates a broader macro-perspective when they work in the field.
