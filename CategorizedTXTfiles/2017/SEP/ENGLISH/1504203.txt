    “On the auspicious occasion of Durga Puja, I extend greetings to my fellow citizens and wish them happiness and prosperity. The festival celebrates the triumph of virtue and destruction of evil.


    Durga Puja is also a festival that cherishes the love we feel for daughters in our families. It symbolises feminine energy, empowerment and determination. Let it further our resolve to build a society in which every woman is able to achieve her true potential- and be an equal stakeholder in every avenue of human achievement. May this be a moment of blessing for our country and our collective well-being”.
