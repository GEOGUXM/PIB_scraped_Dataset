    The nation wide Swachhata Hi Seva campaign is now entering its second week. The inaugural week saw a wave of cleanliness activities across the country.


    In Chennai to keep the city ‘clean and green’, a battery of Judges from the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court joined hands with public, students, officials of the district administration, city corporation, police, Public Works and Income Tax departments in a massive cleaning drive along the Vaigai river.


    In Maharashtra 430 GPs have been declared ODF and over 58 thousand toilets have been constructed since September 15th. In what can be described as an act of deep commitment, world famous sand artist, Mr Sudarshan Pattnaik, used his award money to construct two toilets for fisherman in Puri, Odisha after receiving a personal letter from the Hon’ble Prime Minister to engage with the cause of swachhata. A young girl from Bihar created a song on Swachhata which is drawing significant attention and accolades. In Jharkhand swachhata sentiment was spread to educational institutions by appealing to the universities to clean their campuses.


    The week also saw significant newspaper articles on swachhata from opinion leaders across industries and sectors. Media also played a supportive role through channels like DD Sahayadri which started a special series on ‘Swachhata Hi Seva’ to be broadcast everyday till 2nd October.
