      Minister of Housing & Urban Affairs Shri Hardeep Singh Puri today announced a Rs.300 cr action plan for a visible improvement in Solid Waste Management in Delhi. Addressing the ‘Public Affairs Forum of India’ here today, the Minister said this initiative will be supported by the Ministry from the ‘Urban Development Fund’ operated by Delhi Development Authority.


      Shri Puri informed that under the Plan, automated machinery, equipment and other systems will be procured for better collection, transport and storage of garbage, decentralized treatment and better maintenance of sewers and drains. Soon after assuming office, Shri Puri raised the issue of garbage problem in the national capital during a discussion on Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) in the Ministry on the fifth of this month and desired an action plan for improving the situation.


      North, South and East Municipal Corporation of Delhi will spend Rs.100 cr each on procuring a total of 549 units of modern equipment. An assistance of Rs.80 cr will be provided to each MCD from the Urban Development Fund. All equipment including treatment plants are to be procured and commissioned by the end of this year.


      This initiative will quickly add a waste treatment capacity of 670 metric tons of bio-degradable waste besides preventing release of foul gases, smell and proliferation of germs, pathogens, pests etc.
