      Enhancement of age of superannuation of doctors working in Major Port Trusts to 65 years
      Posted On: 28 SEP 2017 5:16PM by PIB Delhi


    The retirement age of superannuation of doctors working in hospitals in 11 Major Ports has been enhanced to 65 years from the existing 60 years by the Union Cabinet on 27th September, 2017.


    Availability of skilled healthcare professionals poses a key constraint in expanding the health service delivery in Port hospitals. As there is shortage of doctors in Major Port Trustâ€™s health institutions, efforts are already on to recruit doctors to bridge the shortage.


    The decision of the Government to enhance the age of retirement of doctors to 65 years will help in retaining the existing strength of experienced doctors thereby providing better patient care satisfaction. More than 200 doctors working in Port hospital would be benefitted by this decision. This would also help in improving doctor-patient ratio in 11 Major Port Hospitals.


    The decision of the Government is people-centered and pro-patient. It will strengthen health services in Major Ports Trusts and services of experienced doctors shall be available to bring quality health services. This move will also address the shortage of doctors in Port hospitals.
