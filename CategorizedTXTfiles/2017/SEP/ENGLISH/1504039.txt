      India is at the cusp of a next generation of wireless technology 5G. 5G has been conceived as a foundation for expanding the potential of the Networked Society. A digital transformation brought about through the power of connectivity is taking place in almost every industry. The landscape is expanding to include massive scale of “smart things” to be interconnected. Therefore, the manner in which future networks will cope with massively varied demands and a business landscape will be significantly different from today.


      The economic benefits from the 5G technology are also quite immense. As per the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) Committee on Digital Economic Policy, it has been stated that 5G technologies rollout will help in,


      a) Increasing GDP


      b) Creating Employment


      c) Digitizing the economy.


      For India, 5G provides an opportunity for industry to reach out to global markets, and consumers to gain with the economies of scale. Worldwide countries have launched similar Forums and thus, India has joined the race in 5G technologies. We are open for collaboration with them.


      Government has constituted High Level 5G India 2020 Forum with three Secretaries of key Ministries/Departments Telecom, Meity and DST, and also comprising of renowned experts like Dr. A. Paulraj, Professor Emeritus, Stanford University, USA , Mr Gururaj Deshpande - Chairman of Sycamore Networks, Sandstone, USA , Indian industry led by CEOs of ICT industry, Telecom Standard Development Organisation of India (TSDSI), Professors from IIT Madras, IIT Mumbai, IIT Delhi, IIT Hyderabad, IISc Bengaluru, IT industry and stakeholders from industry associations.


      The Term of Reference of the High Level Forum for 5G India 2020 shall be: -


      a) Vision Mission and Goals for the 5G India 2020, and


      b) Evaluate, approve roadmaps & action plans for 5G India 2020.


      The primary goals of the forum are to achieve:


      · early deployment of 5G in India


      · a globally competitive product development and manufacturing ecosystem targeting 50% of India market and 10% of global market over next 5 to 7 years.


      The forum will complement the eco-system by focused actions in the following areas:


      · Research Ecosystem – for IPR development, standards development and proof of concepts through research projects, PPP projects, testbeds and pilot roll-outs.


      · Regulatory Framework – including spectrum assignments and a start-up friendly regulatory environment to enable leap-frog and embracing of innovative technologies.


      · Inclusive Business environment – with special focus on investment incentives favourable to start-ups and innovators and enablement of Venture capitalists.


      Forum will constitute a number of Steering Committees in different domains.


      A vibrant eco-system of research built around 5G that encompasses Industry, Government and Academia will further strengthen the MAKE (& DESIGN) in INDIA initiatives to enable:


      · Design and manufacture of 5G technologies, products and solutions in India;


      · 5G start-ups that enable this design and manufacturing capabilities;


      · Generation of IPR backing the above designs;


      · India based companies should have some essential IPR in the 5G standard;


      · Manufacture of 5G chipsets, this may require massive investments;


      · Appropriate testbeds and technology platforms to enable and help Indian technical ecosystem to have an edge in 5G;


      · Accelerated deployment of next generation ubiquitous ultra-high broadband infrastructure with 100% coverage of 10 Gbps across urban India and 1 Gbps across Rural India.
