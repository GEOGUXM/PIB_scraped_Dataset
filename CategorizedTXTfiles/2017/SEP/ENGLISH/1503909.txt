    The 1 st Advance Estimates of production of major Kharif crops for 2017-18 have been released today by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare. The assessment of production of different crops is based on the feedback received from States and validated with information available from other sources. The estimated production of various crops as per the 1 st Advance Estimates for 2017-18 vis-à-vis the comparative estimates for the years 2003-04 onwards is enclosed.


    As per 1 st Advance Estimates, the estimated production of major crops during Kharif 2017-18 is as under:


    Ø Foodgrains – 134.67 million tonnes.


    · Rice – 94.48 million tonnes.


    · Coarse Cereals – 31.49 million tonnes.


    · Maize – 18.73 million tonnes.


    · Pulses – 8.71 million tonnes.


    · Tur – 3.99 million tonnes.


    · Urad – 2.53 million tonnes (record).


    Ø Oilseeds – 20.68 million tonnes.


    · Soyabean – 12.22 million tonnes


    · Groundnut – 6.21 million tonnes


    · Castorseed – 1.40 million tonnes


    Ø Cotton – 32.27 million bales (of 170 kg each)


    Ø Jute & Mesta -10.33 million bales (of 180 kg each)


    Ø Sugarcane – 337.69 million tonnes


    The cumulative rainfall in the country during the monsoon season i.e. 01 st June to 06 th September, 2017 has been 05% lower than Long Period Average (LPA). Thus, monsoon rainfall conditions have been normal in the country. The estimated production of most of the crops during current Kharif season is estimated to be higher as compared to their normal production of last five years. However, these are preliminary estimates and would undergo revision based on further feedback from the States.


    As per the First Advance Estimates, total production of Kharif Foodgrains during 2017-18 is estimated at 134.67 million tonnes. This is lower by 3.86 million tonnes as compared to last year’s Kharif foodgrains record production of 138.52 million tonnes (4 th Advance Estimates) . However, kharif foodgrain production is 6.43 million tonnes more than the average production of five years (2011-12 to 2015-16) of 128.24 million tonnes.


    Total production of Kharif rice is estimated at 94.48 million tonnes. This is lower by 1.91 million tonnes than the last year’s record production of 96.39 million tonnes. However, it is higher by 2.59 million tonnes over the average production of Kharif rice during the last five years.


    The total production of coarse cereals in the country has decreased to 31.49 million tonnes as compared to 32.71 million tonnes during 2016-17 (4 th Advance Estimates). Production of Maize is expected to be 18.73 million tonnes which is marginally lower by 0.52 million tonnes than that of last year’s record production. Further, this is higher by 2.15 million tonnes than the average production of maize during the last five years.


    T he total production of Kharif pulses is estimated at 8.71 million tonnes which is lower by 0.72 million tonnes than the last year’s record production of 9.42 million tonnes. However, kharif pulses estimated production is 2.86 million tonnes more than the last five years average production.


    The total production of kharif oilseeds in the country is estimated at 20.68 million tonnes as compared to 22.40 million tonnes during 2016-17, i.e., a decrease of 1.72 million tonnes. However, it is higher by 0.69 million tonnes than the average production of last five years.


    Production of Sugarcane is estimated at 337.69 million tonnes which is higher by 30.97 million tonnes than the last year’s production of 306.72 million tonnes. Despite higher area coverage, lower productivity of Cotton has resulted in reduced estimated production of 32.27 million bales (of 170 kg each) as compared to 33.09 million bales during 2016-17. Production of Jute & Mesta estimated at 10.33 million bales (of 180 kg each) is marginally lower than its production of 10.60 million bales during the last year.
