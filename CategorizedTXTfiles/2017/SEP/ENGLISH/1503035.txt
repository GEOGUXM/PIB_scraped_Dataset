    · Short-term external debt increased by 5.5 per cent to US$ 88.0 billion at end-March 2017. This is mainly due to the increase in trade related credits, a major component of short-term debt with a share of 98.3 per cent.

    Notes: R: Revised; P: Provisional # Short term debt is based on original maturity.


    Debt Service Ratio is the proportion of gross debt service payments to current account receipts (net of official transfers)


    A cross country comparison based on “International Debt Statistics 2017” of the World Bank which presents the debt data for 2015, shows thatIndia continues to be among the less vulnerable countries with its external debt indicators comparing well with other indebted developing countries. The ratio of India’s external debt stock to gross national income (GNI) at 23.4 per cent was the fifth lowest and in terms of the cover provided by foreign exchange reserves to external debt, India’s position was sixth highest at 69.7 per cent in 2015.
