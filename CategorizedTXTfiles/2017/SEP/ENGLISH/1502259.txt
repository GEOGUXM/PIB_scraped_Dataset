Trucks as well as drivers’ entry-exist is recorded using RFID card system doing away with paperwork thus reducing human interface. This is one of the steps taken in order to benchmark major ports with globally renowned ports.


        The Ministry has also been proactively undertaking legislative reforms to weed out old obsolete laws and enhancing connectivity of ports to improve their efficiency under its Sagarmala Programme.


        With India striving to improve its manufacturing competitiveness with Make in India, the Govt of India is leaving no stone unturned to make ports the drivers of socio- economic change and aid long term growth trajectory of the economy.
