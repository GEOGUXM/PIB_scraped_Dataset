    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:


    1.1 Crude oil production by ONGC during August, 2017 was 1898.47 TMT which is 2.98% lower than the monthly target but 1.78% higher when compared with August, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-August, 2017 was 9457.74 TMT which is 1.16% lower than target for the period but 2.52% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


    Ø Offshore: Natural decline and increase in water cut from matured fields of Western Offshore. Due to severe monsoon and harsh weather conditions, wells at unmanned platforms could not be attended / monitored which affected regular operations like Gas Lift De-optimization, ESP failure & minimum well monitoring / stimulation etc.


    Ø Onshore: Power shut down in Mehsana (heavy rain) and Assam Assets.


    1.2 Crude oil production by OIL during August, 2017 was 288.48 TMT which is 8.99% lower than monthly target but 6.03% higher than production in August, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-August, 2017 was 1416.81 TMT which is 9.46% lower than target for the period but 5.50% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


    Ø Less than planned achievement due to higher decline in production potential of wells mainly in Greater Hapjan and Greater Chandmari areas.


    Ø Less than planned contribution from work over wells.


    1.3 Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during August, 2017 was 832.98 TMT which is 7.76% lower than the monthly target and 10.47% lower than August, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-August, 2017 was 4230.06 TMT which is 5.06% lower than target for the period and 7.60% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


    Ø RJ-ON-90/1 (CIL): Around 120 wells are closed either due to high water cut or require WOJ. Poor reservoir performance of Bhagyam. Production stopped from Guda, Kaameshwari West, Raageshwari and Saraswati due to non-availability of tanker since July’17.


    Ø Panna-Mukta (Shell): Certain wells closed due to integrity issues in Aug’17. Also, natural decline in Panna-Mukta.


    Ø CY-ONN-2002/2 (ONGC): Test production from 5 oil wells. PML not yet granted.


    Ø CB-ONN-2004/2 (ONGC): Underperformance of wells.


    Natural Gas


    2. Natural gas production during August, 2017 was 2772.94 MMSCM which is 5.38% lower than the target for the month but 3.69% higher when compared with August, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production during April-August, 2017 was 13689.67 MMSCM which is 5.39% lower than target for the period but 4.31% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II. Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of August, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April-August, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

    Ø Low production potential availability of old wells due to water ingress, sand ingress and unexpected down hole problems.


    Ø Unplanned shut down of gas turbines of RRVUNL.


    2.3 Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during August, 2017 was 558.22 MMSCM which is 17.08% lower than the monthly target and 4.51% lower when compared with August, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-August, 2017 was 2716.83 MMSCM which is 17.97% lower than the cumulative target and 10.95% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


    Ø Underperformance of wells in KG- OSN-2001/3 (GSPC)

    Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production


    3.1 CPSE Refineries’ production during August, 2017 was 11197.45 TMT which is 6.12% higher than the target for the month and 1.93% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-August, 2017 was 58851.85 TMT which is 6.86% higher than the target for the period and 3.98% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


    Ø IOCL, Panipat: Throughput lower due to deferment of M&I shutdown from Jul’17 to Jul-Aug’17.


    Ø IOCL, Bongaigaon: High product stock due to restriction in rake movement on account of floods in Assam/Bihar/Bengal.


    Ø BPCL, Mumbai: Lower due to planned outage of CDU3/Hydrogen / Hydrocracker units’ turnaround for revamp.


    Ø MRPL, Mangalore: Advancement of planned shutdown by 3 days for turnaround of DCU and CDU-1.


    3.2 Production in JV refineries during August, 2017 was 1507.39 TMT which is 12.07% higher than the target for the month but 0.94% lower than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-August, 2017 was 4864.70 TMT which is 9.51% lower than the target for the period and 33.89% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year.


    3.3 Production in private refineries during August, 2017 was 7746.64 TMT which is 0.61% higher than the target for the month but 0.47% lower when compared with August, 2016. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-August, 2017 was 38165.26 TMT which is 1.79% higher than the target for the period and 0.89% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year.


    3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of August, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April-August, 2017 vis-à-vis April-August, 2016 are given at Annexures - IV and V respectively.
