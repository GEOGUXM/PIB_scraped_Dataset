    A group of students from Chirang district of Assam attending an Operation Sadbhavana tour organised by the 7 SIKH LI called on the President of India, Shri Ram NathKovind, at RashtrapatiBhavan today (September 25, 2017).


    Welcoming the students, the President urged the young participants of Operation Sadbhavana to strive for national integration. He said that knowledge of languages other than their mother tongue, Assamese, would help them to link themselves with fellow citizens of the country.


    Wishing them a great future ahead, the President asked the students to share the experiences of their tour with their classmates, relatives, elders and others when they return to their State.


    This Sadbhavana tour has been organised by the 7 SIKH Light Infantry battalion of the Indian Army with the aim of providing students an insight into the rich and diverse culture of the country and fostering national integration. The students are visiting Delhi, Jaipur, Ajmer and Udaipur.
