    Various establishments like dhabas, buildings, factories, restaurants, hoardings and advertisements have come up along National Highways illegally. These establishments are safety hazards for traffic plying on National Highways as they allow illegal access and parking of vehicles on the highways. Further, unauthorized hoardings and advertisements are safety hazards as these distract drivers.


    Setting up of these illegal establishments is a punishable offense under Control of National Highways (Land and Traffic) Act, 2002 (Chapter 3 & 4). The NHAI has issued an Appeal to all such establishments to close the illegal access activities at their level and apply for legal access to their establishments under the policy. They have also been asked to remove all the hoardings and advertisements distracting the attention of drivers for safety of the road users. Failing this, Field Officers have been directed to start a special drive to terminate these illegal access, remove hoardings/ advertisements from the ROW of National Highways and take action against illegal parking of vehicles on National Highways with the help of local police and district administration, including lodging of police complaint against such defaulters.
