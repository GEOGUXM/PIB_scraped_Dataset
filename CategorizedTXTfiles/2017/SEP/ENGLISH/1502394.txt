    Airports Authority of India will undertake construction of Integrated Cargo Terminal at Imphal Airport after obtaining grant-in-aid under Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) of Ministry of Commerce & Industry, Govt. of India. The Government of Manipur had planned to establish an Export Import Cargo Terminal (EICT) at Tulihal, Imphal Airport under ASIDE Scheme of the Ministry of Commerce & Industry.

    
    The proposed Integrated Cargo Terminal is expected to give a boost to the export of handicrafts items and perishable cargo. This will also help generate employment opportunities in the North Eastern region of the country, thereby fostering economic development of the region. In addition to this, the EICT will help establish better connectivity with South & Southeast Asia and give a boost to trade between India and the ASEAN countries.
    
    The estimated cost construction of the cargo terminal is Rs.16.20 crores. Out of this, the Ministry of Commerce & Industry has sanctioned a grant of Rs.12.96 crores under TIES. The balance amount to construct will be met out of internal sources of AAI.
