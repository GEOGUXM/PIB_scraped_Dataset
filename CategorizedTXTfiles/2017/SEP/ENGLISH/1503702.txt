    The 23rd Lecture of the “Lecture Series” organized by the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) was delivered by Justice Shri M.M. Kumar, President, National Company Law Tribunal, here today on the topic, “Rule of Law: Achievements and its Trivialization.”


    In his lecture, Justice Kumar gave an elaborate historical perspective of the “Rule of Law” in the context of the Constitution of England, delving upon topics such as the Magna Carta charter of June 1215, Petition of Right of 1628 and the Bill of Rights of 1689. Liberty, Equality and Fraternity are the cornerstones of the Constitution in a democratic society, he observed. He gave a detailed account of how the judiciary has been upholding and protecting the basic structure of the Indian Constitution. Justice Kumar also cautioned on how the Rule of Law can be trivialized.
