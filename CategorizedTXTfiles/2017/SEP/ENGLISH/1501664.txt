    The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs and Sports, MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh awarded the Certificates of Appreciation to the Ministries/Departments based on their performance in the Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS), here today.


    Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh complemented the award winning departments/ministries. He congratulated the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) for winning the certificate for four consecutive quarters. He said that other departments should also learn from the mechanism developed by CBDT for grievance disposal. Due to such mechanisms, the system can be sustained, he added. He also appreciated other ministries for working in the direction of disposal of grievances. He said that DARPG has also conducted a study to analyse the grievances received. The Department has also released the Grievance Study Analysis of 20 Ministries recently. He said that DARPG is also taking inputs and suggesting new reforms.


    Dr Jitendra Singh said that timelines have been framed for timely disposal for grievances, but many grievances are lodged due to lack of awareness. He said that the people need to be educated about the process and be made aware about the information already available in the public domain. He said that the number of grievances lodged has already reached 12 lakh per year and it is an indication of increasing faith of the citizens in the grievance redressal mechanism. The Minister also suggested that input should be received from the ministries which received the maximum number of grievances. He also appealed to the States to make their grievance redressal mechanisms function in a more effective manner.


    Shri C. Viswanath, Secretary, DARPG, said that now the focus of the grievance redressal should be on quality of disposal. He said that the department has conducted an analysis of forty ministries to find out the root cause of the grievances and to see that the root causes are tackled and systemic reforms implemented. He also said that from the study of 20 ministries, 65 reforms have been introduced which has had a positive impact on governance. Study has been undertaken for 20 more ministries recently and 180 reforms have been suggested.


    Shri Ajay Mittal, Secretary, DoPT said that we should focus on the reasons of grievances. He also complemented winners of the certificates for their meritorious performance.


    Following Departments have been conferred with the awards for the quarters from January to March, 2017 and April to June, 2017:

    The DARPG has instituted this Award Scheme for recognizing meritorious performance by the Ministries/Departments for effective redress/disposal of public grievances received on CPGRAMS. Under the Scheme, Certificates of Appreciation are awarded to three Ministries/Departments which are found to have done outstanding work during a quarter as per the prescribed criteria.


    The Certificates are awarded to Ministries/Departments on the basis of volume of grievances received & disposed during a quarter. There are three Categories: Ministries/Departments receiving up to 300 grievances are included in Category A, 301-2000 are included in Category B and more than 2000 grievances are including in Category C during the quarter.


    The parameters for evaluating the performance are as follows: (a) percentage reduction of grievances pending for more than one year (b) pending for more than six months (c) total disposal of grievances during the period. (d) feedback received on CPGRAMS from petitioners whose grievances have been closed.
