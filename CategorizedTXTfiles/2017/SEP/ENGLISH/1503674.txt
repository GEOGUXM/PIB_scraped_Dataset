    The Ministry of Railways has commissioned the second Vistadome Coach, funded by the Ministry of Tourism, on the Jan Shatabdi Express plying on the scenic Mumbai-Goa Route, to provide a panoramic view of the picturesque Western Ghats.
    
    The Vistadome Coach boasts of a glass roof which has electrically controlled opalescence, that is, it can be made transparent or opaque at the turn of a switch. Passengers wanting a better view can head for a special observation deck. All seats are rotatable by 360o and are pushback chairs. The coaches are fitted with automatic sliding compartment doors, multiple TV screens and wider body side door.
    
    Ministry of Tourism provided financial assistance to the tune of Rs.12 Crore @ Rs.4 crore per coach to Ministry of Railways for the manufacture of three glass top coaches, for developing rail tourism in the country. The first Vistadome Coach was commissioned by the Ministry of Railways on the Vishakhapatnam â€“ Araku Valley Route in April, 2017 and is attracting a large number of tourists.
