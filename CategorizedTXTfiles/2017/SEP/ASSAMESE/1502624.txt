      ELECTORAL ROLL


      The Electoral Rolls for Punjab and Kerala with reference to 01.01.2017 have been finally published. The bye-election in the States will be held with the existing rolls.


      ELECTRONIC VOTING MACHINES (EVMs) and VVPATs


      The Commission has decided to use EVMs and VVPATs in the bye-elections in all the polling stations. Adequate numbers of EVMs and VVPATs have been made available and all steps have been taken to ensure that the polls are conducted smoothly with the help of these machines.


      IDENTIFICATION OF VOTERS


      In consonance with the past practice, the Commission has decided that the voter’s identification shall be mandatory in the aforementioned bye- elections at the time of poll. Electoral Photo Identity Cards (EPIC) shall be the main document of identification of a voter. However, in order to ensure that no voter is deprived of his/her franchise, if his/her name figures in the Electoral Rolls, separate instructions will be issued to allow additional documents for identification of voters at the time of poll in the said bye-elections.


      MODEL CODE OF CONDUCT


      The Model Code of Conduct shall come into force with immediate effect in the district(s) in which the whole or any part of the Parliamentary Constituency/Assembly Constituencies going for bye-elections is included, subject to partial modification as issued vide Commission’s instruction No. 437/6/INST2016-CCS, dated 29th June, 2017 (available on the Commission’s website). The Model Code of Conduct shall be applicable to all candidates, political parties and the State Governments concerned. The Model Code of Conduct shall also be applicable to the Union Government for the States concerned.
