    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, yesterday (September 12, 2017) received His Excellency Mr. Alexander Lukashenko, the President of the Republic of Belarus, at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He also hosted a banquet in his honour.


    Welcoming the President of Belarus, the President said that his visit to India has a special importance as year 2017 is the silver jubilee year of establishment of diplomatic relations between India and Belarus.


    The President said that there is a huge opportunity to diversify the bilateral trade between India and Belarus. India is keen to strengthen its trade and investment partnership with Belarus. The ‘Make in India’ programme provides opportunities to companies of both countries for cooperation in the field of defence. Belarus is a great source of potash and India hopes for partnerships in this sector.


    The President said that India acknowledges Belarus’s support at various multilateral forums such as the United Nations, Nuclear Suppliers Group and International Court of Justice. India is committed to further strengthen its relations with Belarus.


    Subsequently, in his banquet speech, President Kovind said that our bilateral partnership so far has been laced with much warmth and friendship; our ties going into the future look equally promising. As two nations with a shared global vision, India and Belarus have stood for respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of all nations. We both support peace and stability in the world and seek peaceful resolution of disputes and conflicts. The two countries also forcefully condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.
