    The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been apprised of the progress under National Health Mission (NHM). The Cabinet was also apprised of the decisions of the Empowered Programme Committee (EPC) and Mission Steering Group (MSG) of NHM. National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched in April 2005 and it morphed into National Health Mission (NHM) with launch of National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) during 2013. Thereafter, NRHM and NUHM became two sub-missions under the overarching NHM.


    Cabinet noted the progress under NHM including accelerated decline in MMR, IMR, U5MR and TFR. It also noted the progress in respect of various disease control programmes like TB, Malaria, Leprosy etc.


    The Cabinet noted that:


    · The rate of decline in U5MR during NHM period has nearly doubled.


    · With the rate of decline achieved in MMR, India would have achieved the target of MDG 5.


    · Millennium Development Goal 6 of halting and reversing the incidence of Malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS had been achieved .


    · Number of endemic blocks with prevalence more than 1 case of Kala Azar per 10000 population was 230 in 2010. It has been brought down to 94 blocks in 2016.


    · Incentives were being provided @ of Rs 150 to Post-Partum Intra-Uterine Contraceptive Device (PPIUCD) service provider and Rs 150 to ASHA for motivating/escorting the client for PPIUCD insertion. To provide impetus for uptake of PPIUCD and Post-Abortion Intra-Uterine Contraceptive Device (PAIUCD) services, proposals for provision of incentives to the acceptor of PPIUCD services and incentives on the same pattern for PAIUCD were placed before the MSG. The MSG approved proposals for providing an incentive to acceptors of the PPIUCD to cover incidental cost and travel cost for follow up visits and provision of incentives for PAIUCD insertion tor acceptor, service provider and ASHA at the same rates as applicable to PPIUCD.


    · R elaxation of norm of one MMU per 10 lakh population in cases where patients served through existing MMUs exceeds 60 patients per day in plain areas and 30 patients per day in hilly areas, on a case to case basis. The MSG also noted the operational guidelines for MMUs.


    · The proposals under Menstrual Hygiene Scheme for Adolescent girls to - (i) increase the budget support from Rs.8 to Rs.12 for a pack of 6 sanitary napkins for the first year for the 19 States that are yet to take up the scheme and thereafter at the existing rate of Rs 8 for a pack of 6 sanitary napkins and (ii) authorise Ministry to approve any further cost escalations.


    · Increase in ceiling of Programme Management Budget under NHM, including monitoring and evaluation, from existing 6.5% to 9 % of the total Annual Work Plan for that year for bigger States and existing 11% to 14 % of the total Annual Work Plan for that year for smaller States/UTs.


    · Proposal for strengthening of school health activities under NHM in all the public and private schools in the country in coordination with Ministry of Human Resource Development through specified activities including promotion of healthy lifestyle behaviours.


    · Incentive to ASHA @ Rs 100 per month for mobilising and conducting mother’s meeting for promotion of breast feeding for conducting Mother’s Group Meeting under Mother’s Absolute Affection (MAA).


    Implementation Strategy:


    · Facilitate increased access and utilization of quality health services by all.


    · Forge a partnership between the Central, state and the local governments.


    · Set up a platform for involving the Panchayati Raj institutions and community in the management of primary health programmes and infrastructure.


    · Provide an opportunity for promoting equity and social justice.


    · Establish a mechanism to provide flexibility to the states and the community to promote local initiatives.


    · Develop a framework for promoting inter-sectoral convergence for promotive and preventive health care.


    Targets:

Annual rate of decline in 2014-15 was 4.4%. India is likely to have achieved the Millennium Development Goal 4 of U5MR at the present rate of decline.


    · Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR): (number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) declined from 178 during 2010-12 to 167 during 2011-13. Subsequent data is yet to be notified by RGI.

    · Total Fertility Rate (TFR) - declined from 2.5 in 2010 to 2.3 in the year 2015 (Presently it is 2.2 as per NFHS 2015-16). We are likely to achieve the 12th Five Year Plan target for TFR of 2.1 by 2017.


    · Malaria API has declined from 1.10 in 2011 to 0.84 in 2016. The 12th Plan target in respect of Malaria has been achieved and the API has been kept below 1 case per 1000 population.
