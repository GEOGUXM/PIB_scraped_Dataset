      Minister of State for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Shri Gajendra Singh and Smt. Krishna Raj today met with Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister, Shri Radha Mohan Singh and took the charge. On this occasion, Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that in his Ministry, he has already accompanied by an experienced and efficient Minister of State, Shri Parshottam Rupala. With the cooperation of these two Ministers of State, I am confident that the resolution of the creation of a new India and doubling the income of the farmers will be completed by 2022.
