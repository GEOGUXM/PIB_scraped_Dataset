    Minister of State (I/C) for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan launched MoP&NG e-Seva, a dedicated grievances redressal platform on Social Media for all queries and grievances relating to Oil and Gas Sector.

      The MOPNG e-Seva is an integrated grievances redressal platform across social media for all Oil & Gas related service issues.

MOPNG e-Seva will also deliver 24 x 7 support for consumers.
      The e-Seva portal will serve as a single point for queries on Twitter and Facebook to begin with; and other social media platforms in due course. A team of Nodal Officers from Oil Companies and Allied Services have been formed to address issues on real-time basis.
      Conversations are being tracked on real-time basis and a standard operating procedure has been put into place for immediate intervention and closure by concerned officials of Companies under the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas. While Oil Companies will continue to do regular redressal through their respective channels for complaints redressal, the MOPNG e-Seva is an exclusive integrated portal that would handle queries that are received on the official handles of Petroleum Minister, Petroleum Ministry and MOPNG e-Seva.
