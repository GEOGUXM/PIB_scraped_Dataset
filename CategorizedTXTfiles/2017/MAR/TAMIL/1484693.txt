    Instances have come to notice where some commercial organizations have released advertisements in newspapers and television channels promoting their brands or products using names or pictorial representation or emblems of institutions or individuals, in contravention of the provisions of the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950, and more specifically Section 3 of the Act.

    Section 3 of the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 stipulates that “ no person shall, except in such cases and under such conditions as may be prescribed by the Central Government, use, or continue to use, for the purpose of any trade, business, calling or profession, or in the title of any patent, or in any trade mark or design, any name or emblem specified in the Schedule or any colorable imitation thereof, without the previous permission of the Central Government or of such officer of Government as may be authorized in this behalf by the Central Government”.


    U nauthorised use of the names or emblems will invite objections and / or legal action. All publications / television channels are directed to adhere to the provisions of the act and should obtain the permission / authority from the competent authority before issuing any advertisement wherein the Emblem and Names, including photos, specified under the Act, are used.
