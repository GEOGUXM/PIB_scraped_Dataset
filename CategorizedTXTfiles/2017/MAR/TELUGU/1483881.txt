    All human rights are women’s rights. Women must be aware of this. They should know about the these rights. Creating awareness of the rights of women is the need of the hour. The Media is a protector of women’s rights. Dr. Ambedkar fructified the gender equality. While speaking on the occasion of International Women’s Day celebrations organised at C.G.O. Towers, Kavadiguda, Hyderabad today the Additional Director General of Press Information Bureau, Hyderabad, Dr. P.J.Sudhakar said that the NDA Government is implementing several schemes and policies for the empowerment of women. The information regarding these programmes must reach the intended target group, that is women. It is most important thing. The Media is a protector of women’s human rights. Problems of women would not be solved when there is lack of information. Dr. Sudhakar explained about the various legislations on women. A number of rights which women are entitled today are the result of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s sincere efforts, who scripted the Constitution. In this context, Dr. Sudhakar mentioned the Right to Eeducation, Right to Equality, Right against Discrimination and Right to Live and Liberty. When Dr. Ambedkar brought forth the Hindu Code Bill for the emancipation of women. He also made a reference of social reformers like Eshwara Chandra Vidya Sagar, Raja Ramamohan Roy and Tanguturi Prakasam Pantulu. The NDA Government under the Prime Ministership of Sri Narendra Modi is striving for the welfare of women. It has brought schemes like “Beti Bachao – Beti Padhao”, ‘Keshore Balika’, “Sukanya Samrudhi Yojana” to name a few. Though there are many Acts and Policies the police department, revenue department, Non- Governmental Organisations must come forward to lend a helping hand in the implementation, Dr. Sudhakar urged. He expressed concern over women who suffer a lot in silence. Women in many countries around the world got the Right to Vote very lately, in India they were bestowed upon this Right immediately after our country achieved Independence. The opportunity arose due to Dr. Ambedkar. Such is his devotion to equality. After his death, the Government enacted 5 legislations. The Special Marriages Act, The Hindu Marriage Act, The Hindu Succession Act are among these legislations. Dr. Ambedkar saw to it that the Constitution be treated as a legislation by itself. He recalled some of the many illustrious womens' names like Durgabai Deshmukh, Chand Bibi, Sultana Razia, Rani Rudramadevi, Jijiya bai (mother to the Maratha Warrior King Sivaji- 'the Great'), Sarojinidevi, Indira Gandhi, Pratibhatai Patel, Sumitra Mahajan, Jayalalitha, Mamta Benerji, Sushma Swaraj who are inspiring many girls to come up in life. There are many legislations which are intended to the welfare of women We cannot pay back the services of our Mothers, he asserted.


    Sri Srinivasa Rao, AE, CPWD gave vent to his feelilngs on the occasion. He told about his mother's passion of seeing him get good education though she is not a literate. In the process, she sold her last ornament, that is, her Mangalsutra when he was not able to pay for his Polytechnic exam fee. I owe it to my mother my present position in the Society, he said. Several woman speakers shared their views about the International Womens' Day. Some opined that it is most important that the mindset of Gents towards Women must change rather than the Acts that are growing in number with the times. A speaker said that it is women who are able to manage the affairs in a better way than men.
