    The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has said the Centre has chalked out a new roadmap to strengthen our border security. Addressing the Passing Out Parade of the Assistant Commandants at the BSF Academy, Tekanpur in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh today, he said the Government plans to seal the International Borders with Bangladesh & Pakistan.


    Shri Rajnath Singh said the BSF has changed the rules of engagement at the International Borders and now BSF is a known Force even in the neighbouring countries. BSF has built 73 Border Out Posts (BOPs) out of 76 BOPs constructed in recent times, he added.


    The Union Home Minister said we are planning for an effective grievances redressal mechanism in the forces. He said the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) are coming forward with such mechanism. Shri Rajnath Singh praised the first BSF woman field officer, Ms Tanu Shree Pareek who passed out from the academy today.


    Congratulating the trainee officers on their successful completion of the tough training, the Union Home Minister called upon them to display courage in the face of professional challenges, compassion with the troops under command and integrity of highest order. He wished them good luck and expressed confidence that the Trainee Officers will live up to the expectations of the Nation. He also applauded the efforts put in by Director, BSF Academy and his team of dedicated instructors for molding and shaping competent officers from a civilian. The ceremony concluded with BSF Band Show, Jaanbaaz Show, Dog Show and Bold Show. Several dignitaries including DG BSF, Senior BSF, Army and Police Officers graced the occasion.


    The Union Home Minister said BSF is the only force after the Indian Army to operate on Land, Water and Air. BSF is not only the 'First Line of Defence' but also the 'First Wall of Defence', he added. Paying homage to the BSF martyrs, Shri Rajnath Singh said many BSF officers and jawans have laid down their lives in service to the nation. Earlier the Union Home Minister laid wreath at the 'Ajay Prahari' memorial in the BSF Academy.


    The Passing Out Parade of BSF Assistant Commandants (Direct Entry) Batch No. 40 & Assistant Commandants (Limited Departmental Competitive Examination) Batch No. 10 was conducted at the Veerangana Lakshmibai Dikshant Prade Sthal in the BSF Academy today. A total of 67 Trainee Officers passed out after their basic training and all trainee officers were administered the Oath of allegiance to the Indian Constitution. Officer Trainee Tanu Shree Pareek, the first women officer inducted in the General Duty (GD) Stream of BSF, commanded the magnificent parade.


    On the occasion, the Union Home Minister awarded trophies to the following trainees:-

    The Union Home Minister also visited the National Training Centre for Dogs at the BSF Academy, where he was welcomed by the dog 'Shera'.


    Later Shri Rajnath Singh visited the home of visually challenged BSF Assistant Commandant Shri Sandip Mishra who lost his eyesight during an ambush in 2000. Sharing lunch with the family, Shri Rajnath Singh remarked Shri Sandip Mishra derives strength from his wife Smt. Indrakshi who decided to marry him in spite of him being specially abled. It is their love for the country which binds Sandip and Indrakshi together, he added.
