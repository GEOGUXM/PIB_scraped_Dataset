At present 39542 hectares of Railway land is under afforestation. Besides this, Ministry of Railways has also finalised a model agreement in consultation with Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change to be entered between Zonal Railways and respective State Forest Department in January, 2016 for plantation of trees on Railway land along the railway track and station yards without transferring the ownership of the land in favour of State Forest Department.

The plantation work on Railway land along the railway track has already been started under this agreement in some of the States. During the year 2016-17 (up to February 2017) 1.22 Cr. saplings have already been planted.
