      Posted On: 21 MAR 2017 2:51PM by PIB Delhi


    All exports including defence exports are covered under the Export and Import (EXIM) Policy issued by Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT). However, Ministry of Defence has formulated a separate Defence Export Strategy to give fillip to defence exports. The strategy includes creation of an Export Promotion Body, engaging Indian Missions / Embassies abroad in export promotion, export financing through Line of Credit etc., better use of Offset policy, export of indigenously developed defence systems and streamlining of the export regulation processes. The Defence Export Strategy has also been put in the public domain and is available at the website of Ministry of Defence ( www.ddpmod.gov.in ).


      This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to PROF. M. V. Rajeev Gowda in Rajya Sabha today.
