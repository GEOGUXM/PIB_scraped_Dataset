    Telangana Government has proposed expenditure in different mission cities over the next three years based on the proposals approved for various cities and towns for 2015-17.


    Under AMRUT, provision of water taps to all urban households in mission cities and augmenting water supply to the normative level of 135 litres per head per day is given priority followed by expanding sewerage and drainage networks while development of open and green spaces every year in mission cities is mandatory.


    Under this mission, central assistance is allocated to States/UTs for five years based on urban population and number of statutory Urban Local Bodies in each State/UT. Cities and towns with a population of above one lakh each are included in the Mission and accordingly, 12 cities and towns from Telangana are among the 500 mission cities. State and city governments propose action plans with matching contributions.


    For Andhra Pradesh, a total investment of Rs.2,890 cr with central assistance of Rs.1,057 was earlier approved for the five year mission period of 2015-20 for 33 mission cities.


    Central Government has approved Rs.50,000 cr for providing central assistance for improving basic urban infrastructure in 500 mission cities during 2015-20.
