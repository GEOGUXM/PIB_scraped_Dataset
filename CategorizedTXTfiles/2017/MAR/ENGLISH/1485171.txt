    An Indian Formed Police Unit (Assam Rifles 7th Contingent) was inducted for deployment at Haiti in last week of July 2016. As per the report received from Assam Rifles, the Cholera vaccines could only be procured by Medical Branch of the Directorate of Assam Rifles after dispatch of the Formed Police Unit (FPU-27th Contingent) to United Nations Mission in Haiti.


    
    On intimation, the Contingent was immediately vaccinated in-situ for Cholera (Both Doses) and as on date all personnel of Formed Police Unit (FPU-2) Assam Rifles Contingent are fully immunised. MHA have also issued instructions for compliance with mandatory Cholera Vaccination for the Uniformed Personnel prior to induction in United Nations Peacekeeping Missions.
    
    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question by Shri Anubhav Mohanty in the Rajya Sabha today.
