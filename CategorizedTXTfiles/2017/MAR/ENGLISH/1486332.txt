      Sericulture Resource Centres
      Posted On: 30 MAR 2017 4:10PM by PIB Delhi

      
      Sericulture Resource Centres (SRCs) were conceptualized on pilot basis during XII plan period as an initiative to further facilitate transfer of seri-technologies from laboratory to land to strengthen the existing extension mechanism for knowledge and skill transfer, ultimately influencing the production of quality silk in the country. So far 11 SRCs have been established in the country during 2015-16 and 2016-17.
      
      The question of vacant posts in the SRCs does not arise, because the SRCs are owned by elite/progressive farmers of a Seri-cluster and function under the supervision of the concerned Central Silk Board (CSB) unit/nested field units.
      
      The SRCs have helped in transfer of improved technologies to around 900 farmers including 400 farmers from North Eastern Region and guided the farmers in disease diagnosis, remedial measures to be taken for disease control besides crop improvement, improved package of practices to be adopted in host plant cultivation, silkworm rearing, hygiene maintenance etc. The SRCs have also organized farmersâ€™ groups for better synergy, forward and backward linkages.
      
      The above information was given by the Minister of State, Textiles, Shri Ajay Tamta today, in a written reply to a Lok Sabha question.
