      PRATHAM, a non-governmental organization conducts annual achievement surveys released in the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER). It is a household survey limited to rural areas of the country. As per their report of 2016, computers are available in 20% of schools in 2016 as compared to 19.6% in 2014. The report indicates only about availability of computers in schools and not about Computer Aided Learning (CAL) in schools. As per the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), 2015-16 (provisional) data, 25.97% of elementary schools have computers for Information Communication and Technology (ICT) and CAL as compared to 25.23% in 2014-15.

      
      There is no decline in the availability of computer and teachers in 2016 as compared to 2014 in Government and Government aided schools at elementary level.
      
      The Central Government, through its flagship programme of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), supports the States and UTs for universalization of elementary education across the country. Under the SSA, States and UTs are supported for improving ICT facilities in upper primary schools, through the CAL component.
      
      During 2016-17, an amount of Rs. 31195.06 lakhs have been allocated for CAL under SSA. Additionally, Central Government has launched Rashtriya Avishkar Abhiyan (RAA) for nurturing a spirit of inquiry and creativity, love for Science and Mathematics and effective use of Technology amongst children. Under RAA, States and UTs are given Rs. 25 lakh per District per annum for promoting activities in the areas of Science, Mathematics and Technology.
      
      This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Shri Upendra Kushwaha today in a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question .
