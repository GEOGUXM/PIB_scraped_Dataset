        General Bipin Rawat, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) is visiting Nepal and Bangladesh from 28 March to 02 April 2017 on his first foreign visit after assuming office. COAS will be visiting important military installations and meeting high ranking dignitaries including the Prime Minister, Defence Minister and the Chief of Army Staff. The delegation will also visit Nepalese Army Mountain Warfare School at Jomsom and the Pension Paying office at Pokhra where the COAS will address the Indian Army ex-servicemen of Nepalese origin.


        The visit to Nepal assumes importance as the President of Nepal will confer the title of “Honorary General of the Nepalese Army” to the COAS at a special investiture ceremony on 29 March 2017. This historic tradition is a reciprocal arrangement that is continuing uninterrupted since its inception in 1969 and has been a hallmark of the special relationship between the Indian and the Nepalese Army. General Rajendra Chettri, the Chief of Army Staff of Nepalese Army was conferred the title of “Honorary General of the Indian Army” on 03 February 2016, during his first visit to India after assuming office.


        Nepal visit will be followed by a visit to Bangladesh, where COAS will be meeting the President, the Prime Minister and the Chief of Army Staff of Bangladesh Army. The delegation will also visit Headquarters of an Infantry Division and Armoured Corps Centre at Bogra.


        This visit will help strengthen mutual trust with immediate neighbourhood particularly in the field of defence cooperation.
