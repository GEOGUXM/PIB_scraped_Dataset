    The Central Forensic Science Laboratories (CFSLs) maintain the repository of cases pending with them. All efforts are being made to optimally utilize the resources of CFSLs after suitable prioritization of cases for proper reporting on due time. In order to increase the efficiency of CFSLs, Government has established three new CFSLs at Bhopal, Guwahati and Pune and upgraded the existing three CFSLs at Chandigarh, Hyderabad and Kolkata at a total project cost of Rs.279.90 crores. In addition, Government has sanctioned 48 new posts and 39 contractual posts of scientific personnel in the CFSLs.
    
    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gagaram Ahir in a written reply to question by Shri Rajeev Chandrasekhar in the Rajya Sabha today.
