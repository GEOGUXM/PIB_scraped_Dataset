      Posted On: 15 MAR 2017 4:11PM by PIB Delhi

      

    At present, a total of 7062 Scientists/ Engineers are in position in ISRO. The demand for space based services in the country is increasing resulting in increased launch frequency and applications of space technology in emerging areas. To meet the work load arising due to these demands, a proposal for suitably augmenting the manpower, mostly in scientist/engineer category, has been prepared.
    
    The proposal has been reviewed and recommended by the Space Commission and the same is submitted to the Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance, for their recommendations, before placing the same for the approval of the Union Cabinet.
    
    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
