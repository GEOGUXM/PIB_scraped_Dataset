    As per the report on Rapid Assessment of India’s maritime energy efficiency, prepared as part of India’s commitment to the Global maritime energy efficiency partnerships (GloMEEP) project, the CO2 emissions from ships registered in India are approximately 4.75 million tonnes for the year 2016 when operating in Indian waters.

    India is one of the 10 Lead Pilot Countries (LPC) in International Maritime Organization (IMO)’s GloMEEP project. The project component includes Maritime Energy Efficiency Capacity Building and Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) to catalyze maritime sector Energy Efficiency Innovation, Research & Development and Technology Deployment, which primarily aims to catalyse the involvement of private sector in maritime sector energy efficiency activities in developing countries through knowledge sharing, international forums and collaborative pilot efforts in technology assessment and deployment.

    This information was given by Minister of State for Shipping, Shri Pon Radhakrishnan in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
