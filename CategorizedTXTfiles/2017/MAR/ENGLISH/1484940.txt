      The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has said that the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi represents "aspirational" India and the youth of the country have reposed overwhelming faith in the Prime Minister because they see in him the realization of their aspirations in “New India”.
      
      Speaking after flagging-off the “T1 Prima Truck Racing Championship” in Greater Noida yesterday, Dr Jitendra Singh said, dignity of labour and building of inspirational values is what the India of 2017 looks forward to. He said, an event like this serves not only as an occasion for excitement of adventure sports, but also as a platform to showcase one’s potentials through one’s inherent aptitude.
      
      India today comprises more than 65% of population below the age of 40 years, said Dr Jitendra Singh, and added that the present government under Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is seriously committed to follow the agenda of youth aspiration, envisaging employability with dignity and well-being. He said, in the contemporary global world, where youth are connected to each other, the Central Government will seek to provide opportunities for the Indian youth to become a resource pool of potential and profession for the rest of the world.
