      Promoting the Use of Organic Manure

        Organic fertilizers have been tested scientifically in Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR), institutions and State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) on various crops and soil types and found suitable for improving soil health and crop productivity. The organic fertilizers presently available may supplement (N,P) by nearly 20-25%. Biofertilizers when applied along with compost @ 5t/ha or vermicompost @ 2t/ha, fertilizer saving is almost 50%. The advantages of these organic fertilizers are that they are eco-friendly and not only provide nutrients for maintaining soil fertility but also improve soil physical & biological health. Government is promoting judicious use of chemical fertilizers in conjunction with organic manures and biofertilizers to maintain soil health and productivity.


        Organic fertilizers largely are produced on-farm by the farmers. When on-farm organic inputs are used, cost of production per unit area is less than 13% under organic agriculture than inorganic management. However, if organic inputs from outside the farm are purchased and utilized, the cost of production increases by about 15-20% depending on the nature of inputs used. Integrated Organic Farming System (IOFS) models being developed under National Project on Organic farming (NPOF) promises to meet 70-80% of organic inputs within the farm thus reducing the market input cost considerably.


        Government is promoting the use of Organic manures under the scheme Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) of National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA). The Government is promoting the use of organic inputs in the country, through assistance as under :


        (i) Financial assistance is provided under the component Integrated Manure Management of Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) for Phosphate Rich Organic Manure (PROM) as per specification given in FCO, 1985 @Rs.1000/acre for procuring and application of PROM to soil to meet phosphorus/Zinc deficiency in soil.


        (ii) Financial Assistance is provided for vermi-compost (size 7’x3’x1’) @Rs.5,000/- unit for procurement of earth worms, preparation of pits, construction of brick wall etc.


        (iii) Promotion of Organic Inputs under Organic & INM Components of Soil Health Management, assistance is provided for Vermi-compost, Bio-fertilizers (Liquid / solid), Waste compost, Herbal extracts etc. including PROM @ 50 % of cost subject to a limit of Rs. 5000/- per ha and maximum Rs.10,000 per beneficiary.


        (iv) Government is also promoting the production of organic manures by providing 100% financial assistance to State Governments/ Government Agencies upto a maximum limit of Rs.190.00 lakh per unit and 33% of project cost maximum limited to Rs.63 lakh per unit for individuals/private agencies through NABARD as capital investment for establishment of agro/vegetable waste compost production units of 3000 Total Per Annum (TPA) production capacity.


        (v) Under the Rain fed Area Development (RAD) component of NMSA, 50% of cost subject to limit of Rs 125/- per cubic ft. and maximum permissible assistance of Rs.50,000/- per unit for permanent structure and Rs 8,000/- per unit for High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) vermi bed is provided for construction of compost unit and, organic input production unit.


        (vi) The Government of India is providing a Market Development Assistance @ Rs.1500/-per metric ton (MT) to Fertilizer Companies for sale of City Compost.
