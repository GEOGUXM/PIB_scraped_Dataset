    The key findings in the report of Transparency International on corruption in Asia-Pacific region are, inter-alia, as follows:


    (i) People in India were most positive about their governments’ efforts in fighting corruption, with 53% saying that Government is doing well to tackle corruption.


    (ii) Only 41% respondents in India think that the level of corruption has increased. This is substantially lower than countries like China (73%), Indonesia (65%), Malaysia (59%), Vietnam (56%), South Korea (50%) and Hong Kong (46%).


    (iii) In the Asia-Pacific region, police forces are perceived to have the highest level of corruption of all the public services accessed by the people.


    (iv) 69% of those respondents in India, who had come into contact with six key public services in previous 12 months like public schools, public clinics or hospitals, official documents, utility services, the police and the courts, had either paid a bribe, given a gift or done a favor in order to receive the services.


    It is pertinent to mention that the survey by Transparency International was not conducted at the behest of the Central Government.


    This was stated by the Minister of State in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions and Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply to a question by Shri J.J.T. Natterjee and Shri Ram Tahal Choudhary and Dr. Thokchom Meinya in the Lok Sabha today.
