      Import of Defence Equipment
      Posted On: 10 MAR 2017 3:24PM by PIB Delhi


    Government is pursuing several measures to realize progressively higher levels of indigenization and self reliance in the defence sector. To this end, the Defence Procurement Procedure 2016 (DPP 2016) has provisions which accord higher priority to procurement from Indian vendors. Notwithstanding this, import of defence equipment may be necessitated to meet operational requirements and when indigenous equipment is not available.


    The expenditure in respect of orders placed on foreign vendors for capital acquisitions during each of the last two years is as under:-
                                   
Year     Expenditure (Rs. in crore)
                                   
                                   
2014-15  24992.36                  
                                   
                                   
                                   
2015-16  22422.12                  
                                   
                                   

    The countries from which defence equipment imports are being undertaken include Russia, USA, Israel, France and UK.

    This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri C.S. Putta Raju in Lok Sabha today.
