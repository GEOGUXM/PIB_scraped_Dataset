      Posted On: 31 MAR 2017 6:10PM by PIB Delhi


      Government proposes to include 500 central schemes under the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme during the next fiscal year. The scope of DBT has been expanded to include ‘in kind’ transfers as well as transfers to various ‘enablers’ of Government schemes like ASHA/ Aanganwadi workers etc. It has been decided to bring all welfare and subsidy schemes of the Government under DBT. DBT Mission has identified more than 500 Schemes/ Components of 63 Ministries /Departments to be implemented through DBT mode in a phased manner by 31st March, 2018. Out of the same, 90 such schemes of 19 Central Ministries/ Departments have been on-boarded to DBT platform as on 20.3.2017. A monitoring framework to assess the preparedness and progress of on-boarding has been put in place. To facilitate DBT implementation, DBT Cells have been set up by 76 Ministries / Departments.


      Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) is a major reform initiative where benefits, in cash or kind, are delivered directly to accurately identified beneficiaries using mostly Aadhaar as an identifier. It envisages efficiency and inclusion in the delivery processes leading to greater accountability and transparency in the system.


      The Central Ministries / Departments and various States have assessed DBT implementation in their Welfare & Subsidy schemes and have reported saving in view of de-duplication, elimination of ghost beneficiaries etc. in the last three years.


      Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas had launched modified Direct Benefit Transfer for LPG (DBTL/PAHAL) Scheme in 54 districts on 15.11.2014 and across the country on 01.01.2015. LPG consumers, who join the PAHAL scheme, get the LPG cylinders at non-subsidized price and receive LPG subsidy (as per their entitlement) directly into their registered bank accounts. As on 27.03.2017, out of 19.81 crore active LPG consumers, 16.95 crore have joined the PAHAL Scheme. Subsidy amount of more than Rs. 46,000 crore has been transferred to the beneficiaries’ bank accounts since its launch.


      This was stated by Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal, Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
