    Defence Canteen, commonly referred as CSD Canteen are entrusted with providing consumer goods and other household articles to the personnel of Defence Services and other entitled categories. However, food served to defence personnel is not through these Defence Canteens. Ration for the food to defence personnel is provided by Supply and Transport Directorate of Army.
    
    A study on quality of ration in Armed Forces was carried out during 2014-15 by Defence Institute of Psysiology and Allied Sciences (DIPAS). The study report has brought out that out of the 53203 number of troops examined, most have found quality of rations to be good and above. Multilevel routine feedback mechanism exists at stations and formation level in respect of ration quality to ensure troops satisfaction. The feedback on quality of ration and suggestions thereon is analysed and perused at the level of Chief of Army Staff. The feedback in last three years has been excellent with no complaints on quality of rations.
    
    This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri Tiruchi Siva in Rajya Sabha today.
