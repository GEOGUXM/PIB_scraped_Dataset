      In the matter of Youth Bar Association of India Vs Union of India and others, the Supreme Court in its judgment dated 7th September 2016 has directed all the Home Secretaries and Director General of Police of the States Government that the copies of the FIRs, unless the offence is sensitive in nature like sexual offences, offences pertaining to insurgency, terrorism and of that category, offences under POCSO Act and such other offences, should be uploaded on the Police website, and if there is no such website, on the official website of the States Governments, with in twenty four (24) hours of the registration of the FIRs.
      
      As ‘police’ and ‘public order’ are State subjects under the seventh Schedule of Constitution of India, the States are primarily responsible for compliance with the Apex Court directives.
      
      Under the ongoing Crime and Criminal Tracking Networks and System (CCTNS) project, there is a provision of entering FIRs in the CCTNS application software. So far over 1 Crore FIR have been entered in the CCTNS system by all States/UTs except Bihar and Rajasthan. The Department Website in Lakshadweep is being re-designed and CCTNS Portal in Jammu and Kashmir is under testing. Apart from these, all other States/UTs are uploading the FIRs as per the ruling of the Supreme Court of India.
      
      This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question by Shri Asaduddin Owaisi in the Lok Sabha today.
