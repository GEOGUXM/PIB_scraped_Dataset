    In pursuance of order dated 11th August 2016 of Hon’ble High Court of Delhi in W.P. No. 6000 of 2015 and 6668 of 2015, a Committee was constituted under the chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) to examine all relevant issues related to existing permits given to black/ yellow taxis, radio taxis, aggregators, etc. The committee had finalized its report in December, 2016. The committee has recommended that city taxies should be allowed to run on App Based platforms. The policy recommendations also ensure that bigger aggregators do not undercut the traditional cabs. The major focus of the policy is to ensure safe, secure and affordable ride to the common public so as to help in reducing congestion as well as pollution in the cities. The policy also recommends that the app used by aggregators is validated for its integrity by an agency authorized by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. The policy would help in a healthy growth of the taxi industry. The policy is recommendatory in nature and would help to provide a particular framework to help the States in framing detailed regulations.
