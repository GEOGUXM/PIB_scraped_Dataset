      Posted On: 23 MAR 2017 5:54PM by PIB Delhi


    Rohini Heliport has been formally inaugurated on 28 February, 2017. The heliport has provisions for operational facilities and Maintenance, Repair & Overhaul (MRO) as well. The heliport has the following facilities;

    (i) Centrally air-conditioned passenger terminal building having the capacity to handle 150 passengers

    (ii) Four hangers of 3600 sqm area (each hanger with 900 sqm)

    (iii) Parking capacity for 12 helicopters

    (iv) Refuelling facility

    (v) Fire services.

    The Heliport has been used for 25 operations so far by various operators. As per ICAO study - "Economic benefits of civil aviation: ripples of prosperity", the output and employment multipliers of aviation are 3.25 and 6.10 respectively. Ministry of Civil Aviation has issued the National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP), which has the provision of development of four helihubs in the Country, namely Northern, Western, Eastern and Southern . One of the Heli-hub has already been developed at Rohini, New Delhi. List of total number of helipads is attached as Annexure 'A'. Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme under NCAP which inter-alia permits helicopter operation only among the States of J&K, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, North Eastern Region of India, A&N Islands and Lakshadweep Islands. However, development of regional air connectivity routes is demand driven and left to market force, such that airline operators undertake assessment of demand of supply required on a particular route. Helipads in States/UT are generally constructed and maintained by State Govt. on requirement basis.


    This information was given by Minster of State for Civil Aviation, Shri Jayant Sinha in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
