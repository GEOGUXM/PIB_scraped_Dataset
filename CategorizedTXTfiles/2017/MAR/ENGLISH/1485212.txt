      Posted On: 22 MAR 2017 5:40PM by PIB Delhi


      Development of logistics and terminal infrastructure is an ongoing process on Indian Railways and depending on the type of traffic, quantum of traffic and the origin-destination flows, capacity of existing terminals are augmented or new facilities developed.

      
      Setting up of Multi-Modal Logistics Parks (MMLP) through Public Private Partnership (PPP) route is one of the areas identified in the 12th Plan. The Private Freight Terminal (PFT) Policy envisages setting up of freight terminals on private land as a multi user facility. The policy guideline was issued in 2012 and thereafter further liberalized in 2015. At present, 44 PFTs are already functional and approval for 39 more has been given by the Zonal Railways.
      
      This Press Release is based on the information given by the Minister of State for Railways Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha on 22.03.2017 (Wednesday).
