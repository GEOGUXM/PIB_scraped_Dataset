        It had come to the notice of the Medical Council of India (MCI) that following two Medical Colleges were functioning without required approval:-
        i. Singhania University, Pacheri Bair, Distt. Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan
        ii. Surendra Medical College and Hospital, Khagol, Patna, Patna
        The MCI had immediately issued press notice about the illegal functioning of theseMedical Colleges for public awareness. When the matter regarding Surendra Medical College and Hospital, Khagol, Patna came to the knowledge of the Ministry at the relevant time, the college was directed to discharge the admitted students. The college was informed that appropriate legal action would be taken against the college for opening the Medical College without permission and making illegal admissions. The State Government of Bihar was asked to take required action.
        Further MCI also publishes the details of approved Colleges on their website for the benefit of prospective students. From the academic session 2017-18 onwards, all admissions in Medical Colleges will be through National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET). States have been advised to fill the seats both in Government and private Medical Colleges through Common Counseling that ensures admissions only in approved Colleges.
        The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
