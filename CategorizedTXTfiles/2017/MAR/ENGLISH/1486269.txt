    Further, the decision of Government of India allowing 100% FDI in food processing under automatic route and 100% FDI in trading, including e-commerce, in respect of food products manufactured and/or produced in India, is likely to give impetus to farmerâ€™s income and also generate more employment through food processing logistics, retail chains and local sourcing.
