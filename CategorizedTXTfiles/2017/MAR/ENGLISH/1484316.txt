      The total sanctioned length of fence along Indo-Bangladesh border is 3326 km out of which 2731 km has been completed. The total sanctioned length of fence along Indo-Pakistan border is 2063.06 km out of which 2003.06 km has been completed. Along Indo-Myanmar border, a 10km fencing has been sanctioned out of which fence work in approximately 4 km has been completed.
      
      The Government has adopted multi-pronged approach for security arrangements at the Indo-Pakistan Border (IPB). The arrangements include deployment of Border Security Force (BSF), construction of border fence, construction of border roads, installation of floodlights, construction of Border Out Posts (BOPs), introduction of Hi-Tech surveillance equipments, providing weapons and Specialised Vehicles to Security Forces, etc.
      
      Vulnerability mapping of the BOPs which are sensitive with regard to infiltration/smuggling along the Borders has been carried out. These identified BOPs have been strengthened by deploying additional manpower, Special Surveillance equipment, vehicles and other infrastructure support. The Government has decided to plug the gaps along Indo-Pakistan Border by means of physical and non-physical barriers.
      
      This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question by Shri Jyotiraditya M. Scindia and Prof. Saugata Roy in the Lok Sabha today.
