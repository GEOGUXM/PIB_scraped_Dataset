      Posted On: 24 MAR 2017 5:22PM by PIB Delhi


    Minister of State for Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Chemicals & Fertilizers, Shri Mansukh L. Mandaviya, while giving a written reply to a question on benefits of Neem Coated Urea in Rajya Sabha today, said that the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare ( DAC&FW ) conducted a study to determine the impact of Neem Coated Urea that clearly demonstrates the benefits of the of the scheme, as detailed ahead .


    Shri Mandaviya informed that the interim report prepared by Agricultural Development and Rural Transformation Centre ( ADRTC ) , Bengaluru has been submitted by Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare ( DACFW ). The brief findings of the study are as follows :


    · Improvement in soil health;


    · Reduction in costs with respect to plant protection chemicals;


    · Reduction in pest and disease attack;


    · An increase in yield of paddy, sugarcane, maize, soybean and tur / red gram to an extent of 5 . 79 % , 17 . 5 % , 7 . 14 % , 7 . 4 % and 16 . 88 % respectively;


    · Diversion of highly subsidized urea towards non - agricultural purposes negligible among farmers after the introduction of the mandatory policy of production and distribution of only Neem coated urea .


    The Minister said that the availability of Urea during 2015 - 16 and in the current year is more than the requirement and sales . Further, some State Governments have reduced their requirement which was initially projected . There is no report of shortages received from any of the State Government . It is, therefore, perceived that Neem Coating of Urea has helped in curbing the diversion .


    The details of consumption of urea during the last three years is as under :

    Giving a background of the Neem Coating of urea in the country, the Minister informed that on 2 nd June 2008, the Government had notified the policy for encouraging production and availability of fortified and coated fertilizers in the country wherein the indigenous manufacturers / producers of the subsidized fertilizers were allowed to produce fortified / coated subsidized fertilizers up to a maximum of 20 % of their total production of respective subsidized fertilizers . This ceiling of production of Neem Coated Urea ( NCU ) was increased from the limit of 20 % to a maximum of 35 % of their total production vide notification dated 11 th January, 2011 .


    Shri Mandaviya said that the Government, on 24 th March, 2015 made mandatory for all the indigenous producers of urea to produce 75 % of their total production of subsidized urea as Neem Coated Urea . Subsequently, on 25 th May 2015, Department of Fertilizers made it mandatory for all the domestic producers of urea to produce 100 % as Neem Coated Urea with an extra MRP of 5 % ( of Rs . 5360 /- per MT ) to be charged by the fertilizer manufacturing entities from farmers . Entire quantity of indigenously produced urea and imported urea is being neem coated w . e . f 1 st September, 2015 and 1 st December, 2015 respectively .


    Also, the Minister stated that the P&K fertilizer companies have reduced the MRP of MOP, DAP and NPK by Rs 5000 / MT, Rs 2500 / MT and Rs 1000 / MT respectively in the month of June 2016 and again Rs 1300 / MT for DAP in the month of December, 2016 and it seems that the reduction of prices of P&K fertilizers will encourage the farmers to use more P&K fertilizers which will help the balanced use of fertilizers .
