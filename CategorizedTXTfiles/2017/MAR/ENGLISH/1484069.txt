      Posted On: 10 MAR 2017 12:57PM by PIB Delhi


    Government has been asking the State Governments to strengthen the financial management system and ensure that National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) grants are not misused. Central Government has issued operational guidelines, advisories and has implemented well established monitoring mechanism under NHM to strengthen the financial management system.

    Additional funds are given to States under NHM (earlier NRHM) that perform better on specific performance parameters. That details of incentive/disincentive from F.Y. 2015-16 and 2016-17 are given below:
