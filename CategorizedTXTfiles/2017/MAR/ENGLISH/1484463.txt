    Sahitya Akademi an autonomous organization under Ministry of Culture is set up with the mandate of promotion of Indian literature only.
    
    Ministry of Culture through Sahitya Akademi, promotes Indian literature in 24 recognized languages. Sahitya Akademi brings out annually more than 400 books in its 24 recognized languages along with the three journals, Indian Literature, Samakaleen Bharatiya Sahitya which are the bi-monthly journals and a half-yearly journal, Samskrit Pratibha. All the three journals covers the literature written in different languages and, hence, these journals are not only promoting the literature but also writers in these languages.
    
    In addition, Ministry of Culture is also implementing schemes such as Cultural Functions Grant Scheme, Award of Fellowship to Outstanding Persons in the Field of Culture, which among other areas, also deals with promotion of literature and litterateurs. Further, the Financial Assistance Scheme for participation in International and Domestic Book Fairs and International Events is a flagship scheme which the Ministry directly implements.
