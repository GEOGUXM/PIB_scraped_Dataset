    There are 32 State/UT Waqf Boards at present in the country. According to Section 32(1) of the Waqf Act, 1995, the general superintendence of all Auqaf in a State is vested in the State Waqf Board, established by the State/UT Government. The State Waqf Board exercises its power under this Act to ensure that Auqaf under its superintendence are properly maintained, controlled and administered. Hence, the details of Waqf Properties and earning are not maintained by Central Government. However, this Ministry has developed Waqf Management System of India (WAMSI) Portal for entering data of Waqf Properties. So far, State/UT Waqf Boards have entered 5,56,549 Immovable Waqf Properties in WAMSI registration module as on 28.02.2017. State-wise details of moveable & immovable Waqf Properties are available on the WAMSI portal at wamsi.nic.in.


    
    Central Waqf Council under this Ministry is the nodal authority to advise and issue directives to Waqf boards under section 9 of the Waqf Act 1995 as amended.
