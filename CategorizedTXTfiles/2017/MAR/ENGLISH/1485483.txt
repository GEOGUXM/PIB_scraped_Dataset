    The Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment has introduced a Bill titled "The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016" in the Lok Sabha on 2.8.2016. The Bill has been referred to the Standing Committee on Social Justice & Empowerment for examination. The Committee has been granted time till the first week of the Monsoon Session, 2017 to present the report.


    As informed by the Registrar General of India (RGI), during Enumeration of Census 2011, for the first time three codes were provided i.e. Male-1, Female â€“2 and others -3. This was at the discretion of the respondent. In case the respondent wished to record neither '1' nor '2', then enumerator was instructed to record sex as 'other' and give code '3'. Still, it is important to note that the Census on India does not collect any data specifically on 'transgender'. Thus, the category of 'other' would not only include 'transgender' but also any person who desires to record sex under the category of 'other'. It is also possible that some transgenders would have returned themselves either male or female depending upon their choice. The population of 'other' as per Census 2011 is 4,87,803.


    The details of funds allocated during the last two years is as under:-

                   
2014-15  1.00 Crore
                   
                   
                   
2015-16  1.56 Crore
