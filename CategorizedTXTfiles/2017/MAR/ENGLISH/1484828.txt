    (Rs. in crore )

2013-14  73,444.59         66,406.41          66,850.30           --

    No amount remained unspent during year 2013-14, while only a minor sum of ` 289.35 crore remained unspent during 2014-15 as a cumulative effect of small savings under various heads of account. During 2015-16 savings have occurred due to various reasons including slow progress in UAV Heron contracts/ major shipbuilding contracts, slow progress of strategic forces command and signal intelligence projects, non conclusion of submarine projects etc.

    Modernization of Armed Forces is a continuous process based on threat perceptions, operational challenges and technological changes to keep the Armed Forces in a state of readiness to meet various security challenges. This is achieved through induction of new equipment and technological upgradation of capabilities. The equipment and capabilities to be acquired for the Armed Forces are identified through a comprehensive planning process and after deliberations at various levels.


    Government is pursuing several measures to realize progressively higher levels of indigenization and self- reliance in defence sector. To this end, the Defence Procurement Procedure 2016 (DPP 2016) has provisions which accord higher priority to procurement from Indian vendors. Notwithstanding this, import of defence equipment may be necessitated to meet operational requirements and when indigenous equipment is not available.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri KesineniNani in Lok Sabha today.
