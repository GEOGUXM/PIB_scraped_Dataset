      (i) MEIS Scheme under new Foreign Trade Policy 2015-20.
      (ii) Restoring Interest rate subvention for pre and post shipment credit for the textile sector,
      (iii) Expanding the scope of Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS) since 29.10.2015 to 110 new tariff lines and increase rates or country coverage or both for 2228 existing tariff lines.
      (iv) Increased Duty Drawback rates for some textile articles.
