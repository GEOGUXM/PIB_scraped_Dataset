      Posted On: 20 MAR 2017 5:13PM by PIB Delhi

        As per our estimates India has the largest collection of Manuscripts. For documentation, conservation /preservation and digitization of Manuscripts project, National Mission for Manuscripts (NMM) was launched by the Ministry of Culture in 2003. Till date it has documented about 42 lakh Manuscripts in different scripts and languages. For conservation of Manuscripts, Manuscripts Conservation Centres (MCCs) have been established by NMM all over the country, which conduct preventive and curative conservation of Manuscripts requiring conservation in their region.
        Digitization of Manuscripts is done by NMM itself through invitation of open tenders.
        1. Number of Manuscripts documented – 42 lakhs Manuscripts.
        2. Number of Manuscripts digitized – 2.80 lakh Manuscripts.
        3. Number of Manuscripts conserved – preventive conservation of 733 lakh folios and curative
        conservation of 16 lakh folios.
