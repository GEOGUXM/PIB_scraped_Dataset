    The percentage of deliveries conducted by Caesarean section (C-section) in the country is 17.2% as per National Family Health Survey-IV (NFHS-IV, 2015-16). As NFHS does not conduct survey every year, separate details during the last three years are not available. However, as per Health Management Information System (HMIS) the numbers of Caesarean section for the last three years is available and placed at Annex.


    The percentage for rural and urban Caesarean Section in the country is available in NFHS IV (2015-16). The percentage for Caesarean Section in the country is higher in urban areas than rural areas with 28.3% and 12.9% respectively as per the latest National Family Health Survey-IV (NFHS-IV, 2015-16).


    As per NFHS-IV, the incidence of C-section is higher in some states. There are multiple reasons for higher rates of C-section. Nowadays the family size is small, hence, every pregnancy is precious. Some common and important indications for C-section includes foetal distress, prolonged labour, Oblique presentation of the foetus, a woman who is pregnant for the first time and previous C-section and C-section on demand by some patients. It is observed that due to good antenatal care, more high risk pregnancies are identified which also leads to high C-section.
