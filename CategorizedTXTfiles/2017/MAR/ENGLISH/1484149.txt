    As per the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, a total number of 222, 280 and 293 cases have been registered under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA) 2006 in the year 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively. The reasons for child marriage are complex and it is mind set problem which considers girl child as a burden. Social customs, tradition, illiteracy, poverty, low status of women in society, lack of awareness about consequences of child marriage are some of the other reasons that encourage the practice of child marriage.
    
    The Government of India has enacted the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 in order to prohibit child marriages rather than only restraining them. The States/UTs from time to time are being regularly pursued for effective implementation of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. The practice of Child Marriages is a social evil perpetuated social customs, tradition, illiteracy, poverty, low status of women in society and lack of awareness. These issues cannot be tackled by legislative interventions alone. This is a continuous process and Government undertakes media campaigns and outreach programmes to address this.
    
    This information was given by Minister of State for Women & Child Development, Smt Krishna Raj in reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
