    Ministry of Power has taken several measures to provide 24X7 affordable and environment friendly ‘Power for All’ by 2019. This was stated by Shri Piyush Goyal, Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal & New and Renewable Energy and Mines in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today. The measures inter-alia, include the following:-
    
    i. Electrification of 18,452 un-electrified villages (as on 1/4/2015): As on 20/03/2017, 12,661 villages have been electrified.
    
    ii. Preparation of state specific action plans for 24X7 Power for All, covering adequacy of generation, transmission capacity and distribution system: 24X7 Power for All documents have been signed with 35 States/UTs.
    
    iii. Launching of scheme called Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) for rural areas: The scheme provides for (a) separation of agriculture and non-agriculture feeders; (b) strengthening and augmentation of sub-transmission and distribution infrastructure in rural areas including metering at distribution transformers, feeders and consumers end; and (c) rural electrification.
    
    iv. Launching of Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) for urban areas: The scheme provides for (a) strengthening of sub-transmission and distribution networks in urban areas; (b) metering of distribution transformers/feeders/consumers in urban areas; and (c) IT enablement of distribution sector and strengthening of distribution network.
    
    v. Operationalization of Power System Development Fund (PSDF): PSDF shall be utilized for the project proposed by distribution utilities for (a) creating necessary transmission system of strategic importance; (b) installation of shunt capacitors etc. for improvement of voltage profile in the grid; (c) installation of standard and special protection schemes; and (d) Renovation and Modernisation of transmission and distribution systems for relieving congestion; etc.
    
    vi. Launching of Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY): The scheme has been launched for operational and financial turnaround of Discoms.
    
    vii. Measures initiated for reducing the generation cost of coal based power projects:
    
    (a) Increasing supply of domestic coal;
    (b) Coal usage flexibility
    (c) Rationalization of coal linkages
    
    viii 56,232.6 MW generation capacity have been added during the period 2014-17 (as on 28.02.2017).
    
    ix. Increase in electricity generation from 967 BU (Billion Unit) in 2013-14 to 1048 BU in 2014-15 and 1107 BU in 2015-16, resulting in lowest ever energy deficit of 2.1% in 2015-16. During the current year 2016-17 (upto February 2017), electricity generation has been 1057.746 BU. Energy deficit has further reduced to 0.7% during the period April-February, 2017 which is the lowest ever.
    
    x. 73,798 ckm transmission lines and 1,89,948 MVA sub-station capacity added during 2014 to February, 2017. 87% increase in transmission capacity to South India from 3450 MW in April- 2014–February, 2017 to 6450 MW.
    
    xi. Implementation of Green Energy Corridor for transmission of renewable energy.
    
    xii. Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA) to replace 77 crore incandescent bulbs with LED bulbs. This will result in estimated avoided capacity generation of 20,000 MW and save 100 billion kWh per year by March, 2019. As on date, 21.8 crore LED bulbs have been distributed. In addition, over 5.36 lakh energy efficient fans and 13.37 lakh LED tube lights have been distributed.
    
    xiii Street Lighting National Programme (SLNP) is being implemented to replace 1.4 crore conventional street lights by LED street lights. The replacement will result in avoided capacity generation of 1500 MW and save 9 billion kWh per year by March, 2019. As on date, over 18.3 lakh LED Street lights have been replaced across the country.
    
    The Minister further stated that the funding pattern for the new schemes initiated by the Government is as under:
    
    i. DDUGJY & IPDS: Government of India Grant – 60% (85% in case of Special Category States; Utility/State contribution – 10% (5% in case of Special Category States); loan from banks/financial institutions – 30% (10% in case of Special Category States) – Additional grant from GoI on achievement of prescribed milestones – 50% of the loan component.
    
    ii. PSDF: Subject to availability of funds and admissibility, the quantum of grant towards project cost ranges from 75% to 100% for non Special Category States. The projects from North-East and other hill States, namely, J&K, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand are eligible for grant upto 100%.
