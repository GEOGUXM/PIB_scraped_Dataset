      Posted On: 22 MAR 2017 3:28PM by PIB Delhi

      

    The Ministry of Home Affairs, in exercise of the powers conferred under sub-rule 3 of Rule 16 of the All India Services (Death-Cum-Retirement Benefits) Rules, 1958 has, in public interest, prematurely retired two IPS officers, namely, Shri Mayank Sheel Chohan, IPS (AGMUT:1998) and Shri Raj Kumar Dewangan, IPS (CH:1992) vide order dated 05.01.2017.
    
    The review is required to be carried out in respect of:-
    (i) all officers who have completed 15 years of qualifying service;
    (ii) all officers who have completed 25 years of qualifying service or attained the age of 50 years, whichever is earlier, subject to the following conditions:
    (a) An officer should have completed minimum 15 years of qualifying service;
    (b) In case of the State Service Officers appointed to an All India Service by promotion or by selection, they should have completed a minimum of 5 years of actual service in the respective All India Service.
    
    The Review Committee reviews records of officers under Rule 16 (3) of All India Services (Death-Cum-Retirement Benefits) Rules, 1958 by keeping in mind two broad objectives; firstly, to weed out officers of doubtful integrity and secondly, to weed out officers who have outlived their utility and have become inefficient or ineffective.
    
    No proposal of Service Review of Indian Police Service Officers has been received from the State Government of Jharkhand during the last two years and current year. The State Government has been advised to undertake such Review.
    
    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question by Shri Sanjiv Kumar in the Rajya Sabha today.
