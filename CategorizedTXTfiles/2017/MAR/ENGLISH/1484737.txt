    CGHS does not procure and provide any stents to its beneficiaries directly and reimburses the cost of procedures at rates prescribed by CGHS to empanelled hospitals. The stents and other products, if any, are supplied by hospital concerned to the patient. Further, no complaint about inferior quality stents having been provided has been received from any CGHS beneficiary.


    National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) has informed the views expressed by some stakeholders during consultations with NPPA that stents supplied to CGHS stream are very basic. The Ministry is vigilant about all the services being provided to CGHS beneficiaries including stents.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), ShFaggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
