    The amount credited to IEPF forms a part of the Consolidated Fund of India, from which the Ministry receives separate budgetary allocation specifically for making refunds against eligible claims as well as for creating investors awareness as per the mandate of the Companies Act. Claimants can approach the IEPF Authority for refund after the funds are transferred to IEPF. As on 10th March, 2016, 263 claimants against 114 companies have made applications for refund.


    This was stated by Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal, Minister of State for Corporate Affairs in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
