    Modernization and capacity expansion of units of HPC namely Cachar Paper Mill and Nagaon Paper Mill in Assam has not been taken as yet. However, modernization and refurbishment of some sections of the units has been incorporated in the proposed revival plan of HPC.

    
    A complaint was received through Central Vigilance Commission regarding alleged irregularities in the procurement of Bamboo. The case has been forwarded to CBI to inquire the matter comprehensively.
    
    At present, Government has no such proposal. However, the purchase policy of HPC for bamboo has been updated and hoisted by HPC on their website.
    
    This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Lok Sabha today.
