    Out of 111 National Waterways (NWs), NW 1, 2 and 3were declared as NWs in 1986, 1988, 1993 respectively and NW-4 & 5 in 2008. Development work in these five NWs were undertaken after techno-economic feasibility studies and Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) including safety aspects.

    The Registration and survey of mechanically propelled inland vessels is mandatory under the Inland Vessels Act, 1917. The Act prescribes compliance requirement for life saving appliances, communication and navigation apparatus to be installed on board inland mechanically propelled vessels.
