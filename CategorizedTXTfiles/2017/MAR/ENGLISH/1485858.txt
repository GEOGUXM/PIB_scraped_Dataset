    World Health Organization (WHO) in its statement released in April, 2015 has said that at population level, Caesarean section rates higher than 10% are not associated with reductions in maternal and newborn mortality rates. Government of India (GoI) has already written to all States and UTs sharing the latest WHO statement. In addition, States have been informed to conduct periodic prescription audits in the private health facilities under the Clinical Establishment Act. They have also been informed that prescription audits can be extended to public health facilities. The Government of India has enacted the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010 with the objective of registration and regulation of health care institutions including those in the private sector. 10 States and 6 UTs have adopted the Clinical Establishment Act. Health being a state subject, it is the responsibility of the state to effectively implement the act.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
