      Posted On: 28 MAR 2017 4:42PM by PIB Delhi


    India is a signatory of UNECE, WP-29, 1998 agreement and takes active part in the formulation of Global Technical Regulations. As such all safety norms prescribed under CMVR 1989 are based on UN regulated international standards.

    
    Although government has not put any mechanism in place to monitor and redress manufacturing defects, Indian Auto Industry has proactively, on a voluntary basis put in place ‘Voluntary Recall Policy’ since June 2012.
    
    This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Lok Sabha today.
