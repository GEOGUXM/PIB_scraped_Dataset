For the declaration made under this campaign, the employer shall be responsible to remit the employer’s contribution, interest under section 7Q of the Act and damages. As an incentive, the following shall apply to the declarations made under the campaign: -
    
    (i) The employee’s share of contribution if declared by the employer not to have been deducted shall not be required to be paid.
    
    (ii) The damages to be paid by the employer in respect of the employees for whom declaration has been made under this campaign shall be at the rate of Rupee 1(one) per annum.
