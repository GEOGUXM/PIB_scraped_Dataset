    'Police' and 'Public order' being State subjects, the State Governments have their own surrender and rehabilitation incentives to bring Left Wing Extremists cadres into the mainstream. The Government of India reimburses the claims made by the State Governments on the rehabilitation of surrendered LWE cadres under the Security Related Expenditure Scheme, subject to a ceiling of rs.2.5 lakh for higher ranked and rs.1.5 lakh for middle/ lower ranked LWE cadres. The additional incentives given for surrender with weapons/ammunition are also reimbursed which range from rs.10 to rs.35,000 per weapon depending on type of weapon surrendered from detonator to Light Machine Gun, Rocket Launcher etc. In addition, a monthly stipend up to rs.4,000 per month per surrenderee is paid for a maximum period of 36 months for vocational training for the surrenderee.

    As per the report from Jharkhand Police, a FIR No.77/2014 dated 28.03.2014 was registered in Lower Bazaar Police Station, Ranchi District under sections 406/420/120B IPC, on the basis of a complaint received with regard to bogus surrender of Naxals. Five persons have been arrested as accused and a charge sheet No. 94/2014 dated 27.05.2014 along with supplementary charge sheets Nos.- 188/2014 dated 29.09.2014 and 2003/2015 dated 17.08.2015 have been filed against them. The matter is sub-judice.

    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question by Shri Sanjiv Kumar in the Rajya Sabha today.
