As a result of the initiatives of the Government, the country’s Total Fertility Rate (TFR) has declined from 2.7 in 2006 to 2.2 in 2016 (NFHS- IV). The decadal growth rate has declined from 21.54 % in 1990-2000 to 17.64 % during 2001-11. The Crude Birth Rate has declined from 23.8 in 2005 to 20.8 (SRS 2015) and 24 states/UTs have already achieved the replacement level TFR of 2.1 or less out of 36 states/UTs.
