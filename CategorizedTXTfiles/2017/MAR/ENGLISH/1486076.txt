    In the Financial Year 2015-16, the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region launched a scheme namely ‘North-East Road Sector Development Scheme (NERSDS)’ for rehabilitation/up-gradation of important but neglected inter-State roads of the region to be implemented by National Highways Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL). The scheme was transferred to North Eastern Council in 2016.
    Further to this, the following 4 (four) Nos. of roads were taken up for implementation by NHIDCL under the scheme:
    
    1. Upgradation of Doimukh to Harmuti Road in Arunachal Pradesh & Assam.
    2. Upgradation of Tura-Mankachar road in Assam.
    3. Rehabilitation and upgradation of Saiphai-Bagha Bazar (16.5 km) portion in Assam of the Sherkhan-Bagha Bazar road.
    4. Rehabilitation of Wokha-Merapani-Golaghat road in Nagaland and Assam.
    
    However, the road at S. No. 3 was later on taken up by the Government of Assam under different sources of funding and as such NHIDCL is implementing 3 (three) roads as on now.
    
    A sum of Rs. 225.00 crore has so far been allotted to NHIDCL to implement the work of identified roads.
    
    This was stated by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question by Shri Maheish Girri in the Lok Sabha today.
