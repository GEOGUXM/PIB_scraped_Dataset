      Posted On: 21 MAR 2017 2:46PM by PIB Delhi


    Industry is a State Subject and therefore, any centralized data regarding number of heavy industries/setting up of heavy industries/development of heavy industries in the country is not maintained in the Department of Heavy Industry (DHI). The role of DHI is confined to the administration of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) under its administrative control. The Department however seeks to provide technology development, as well as environment friendly technologies in the industry through innovative schemes. Many States have evolved incentives and schemes for the development and growth of industries including heavy industries. Central Government, through Ministry of Finance, also provides incentives in the direct and indirect tax structure for the growth of industries across the country.
    
    Moreover, the ‘National Policy on Capital Goods’ has been launched by the Minister for Heavy Industries & Public Enterprises on 15th February, 2016 during “Make in India Week”. Details of the Policy is available in DHI Website .
    
    This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Lok Sabha today.
