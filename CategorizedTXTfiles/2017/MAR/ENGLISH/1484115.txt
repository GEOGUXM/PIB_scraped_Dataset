    A large number of officers have been trained, as Counsellors, to provide psychological counseling to the defence personnel and their families. Civilian psychological counselors have also been employed, to provide mental health services. A Psychologist, visits units and formations from time to time and carries out psychological counseling, individually and at times in groups.


    Government has taken various other measures also to prevent such incidents. Some of these measures include improvement in living and working conditions through provision of better infrastructure and facilities; additional family accommodation, liberalized leave policy, establishing grievance redressal mechanism, conduct of yoga, meditation as part of unit routine etc.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri Hariom Singh Rathore and Shri Feroze Varun Gandhi in Lok Sabha today.
