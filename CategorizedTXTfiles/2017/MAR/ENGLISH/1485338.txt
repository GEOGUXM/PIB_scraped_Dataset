      Posted On: 23 MAR 2017 1:09PM by PIB Delhi

      On account of increased production of coal imports have fallen from 217.78 Mte in 2014-15 to 199.88 Mte in 2015-16. The trend of fall in import of coal has continued in 2016-17 wherein for the period April 2016-January 2017, coal imports have reduced by 2.59% as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. This was stated by Shri Piyush Goyal, Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal & New and Renewable Energy and Mines in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
      However, import of coal is not solely dependent on the domestic production of coal. It also depends on other factors like power plant designed on imported coal and insufficient availability of coking coal of required grade. A policy for allocation of coal to power sector is under formulation, the Minister added.
      The Minister further stated that as per International Energy Agency (IEA), India was the third largest producer and second largest importer of coal in 2014 in the World.
