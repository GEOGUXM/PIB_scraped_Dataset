      Posted On: 10 MAR 2017 5:26PM by PIB Delhi


    The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) based inflation increased to 5.2 per cent in January, 2017 from 3.4 per cent in the previous month mainly due to rise in ‘fuel & power’ inflation reflecting hike in global crude oil prices.
    
    The Government has taken a number of measures to control inflation. The steps taken, inter alia, include, (i) increased allocation for Price Stabilization Fund in the budget 2017-18 to check volatility of prices of essential commodities, in particular of pulses; (ii) created buffer stock of pulses through domestic procurement and imports; (iii) announced higher Minimum Support Prices so as to incentivize production; (iv) issued advisory to States/UTs to take strict action against hoarding and black marketing under the Essential Commodities Act 1955 and the Prevention of Black-marketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980; (v) imposed 20 per cent duty on export of sugar; and (vi) reduced import duty on potatoes, wheat and palm oil.
    
    This was stated by Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal, Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
