    The Law Commission of India in its 264th Report titled “Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2017 (Provisions dealing with Food Adulteration)”, while reviewing sections 272 and 273 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860 to address the concern of the Supreme Court in matters relating to food adulteration, recommended that the provisions contained in sections 272 and 273 of the IPC may be suitably modified on the lines of the provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The report is available on the internet at http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/reports/Report264.pdf
    
    As criminal law and criminal procedure is in the Concurrent List, the 264th Report of the Law Commission has been circulated by the Ministry of Home Affairs to all the State Governments / UT Administrations for their comments.
    
    Data on deaths caused due to adulteration in food items is not maintained centrally by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India.
