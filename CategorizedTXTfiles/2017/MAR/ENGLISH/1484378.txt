    The Framework Agreement of August 3, 2015 between the Government of India and the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Issak-Muivah) NSCN(I-M) is a relevant document. Details of the final settlement are being worked out within the parameters of the Framework Agreement. Hence it would be premature to make public the Framework Agreement.
    
    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to a question by Shri D.P.Tripathi in the Rajya Sabha today.
