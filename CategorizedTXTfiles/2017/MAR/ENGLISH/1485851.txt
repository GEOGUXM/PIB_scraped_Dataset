      Services Provided in Government Hospitals
      Posted On: 28 MAR 2017 4:19PM by PIB Delhi

      

        The number of patients visiting three Central Government Hospitals viz. Safdarjung Hospital, Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and Lady Hardinge Medical College and associated Hospitals for treatment is much larger as compared to their handling capacity in terms of number of beds, manpower and other resources. Despite availability of huge infrastructure and other services in these hospitals, there is a waiting period for certain procedures due to the ever increasing pressure on infrastructure and available manpower in these hospitals, which varies from Department to Department in these Hospitals.


        As per information provided by Medical Council of India, there are a total 9,88,922 allopathic doctors registered with the State Medical Council/Medical Council of India as on 30th June, 2016. Assuming 80% availability, it is estimated that around 7.91 lakh doctors may be actually available for active service. It gives a doctor population ration of 1:1668 as per current population estimate of 1.32 billion .


        The Government has taken various steps to increase availability of doctors. These steps include:


        I. The ratio of teachers to students has been revised from 1:1 to 1:2 for all MD/MS disciplines and 1:1 to 1:3 in subjects of Anesthesiology, Forensic Medicine, Radiotherapy, Medical Oncology, Surgical Oncology and Psychiatry in all medical colleges across the country. Further, teacher: student ratio in public funded Government Medical Colleges for Professor has been increased from 1:2 to 1:3 in all clinical subjects and for Associate Prof. from 1:1 to 1:2 if the Associate Prof. is a unit head. This would result in increase in number of specialists in the country.


        II. DNB qualification has been recognized for appointment as faculty to take care of shortage of faculty.


        III. Enhancement of maximum intake capacity at MBBS level from 150 to 250.


        IV. Enhancement of age for superannuation to 65 years for all sub-cadres of Central Health Services.


        V. Relaxation in the norms of setting up of Medical College in terms of requirement for land, faculty, staff, bed/bed strength and other infrastructure.


        VI. Strengthening/upgradation of State Government Medical Colleges for starting new PG courses/Increase of PG seats.


        VII. Establishment of New Medical Colleges by upgrading district/referral hospitals preferably in underserved districts of the country.


        VIII. Strengthening/ upgradation of existing State Government/Central Government Medical Colleges to increase MBBS seats.
