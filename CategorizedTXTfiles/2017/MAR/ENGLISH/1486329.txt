      Posted On: 30 MAR 2017 4:08PM by PIB Delhi

      
      Looms operated with the aid of electric power for manufacturing of cloth are called as Powerlooms whereas the handlooms are looms operated without aid of power.
      
      The Handlooms (Reservation of Articles for Production) Act, 1985 protects the interests of the handloom sector from the encroachment of the powerloom industry by way of reserving 11 textile articles with certain specifications for exclusive production by handlooms. Whenever any violation is detected, suitable action is initiated under the Handloom Act, 1985. Government of India has introduced ‘Handloom Mark’ and ‘India Handloom Brand’ to identify the origin and quality of the handloom products. Also, 57 handloom products have also been registered under the Geographical Indication (GI) of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999.
      
      The above information was given by the Minister of State, Textiles, Shri Ajay Tamta today, in a written reply to a Lok Sabha question.
