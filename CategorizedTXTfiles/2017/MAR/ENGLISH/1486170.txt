    Three Indian satellites were launched onboard PSLV-C37 on February 15, 2017. These satellites are: (i) Cartosat-2 Series satellite (weighing 714 kg) and (ii) two Indian Nano-satellites viz., INS-1A & 1B (together weighing 18.1 kg).


    The objective of Indian Cartosat-2 series satellite is to provide high resolution images of earthâ€™s surface at sub-meter resolution (Black & White image) and at 2 meter resolution (4-band colored image). The images obtained from this satellite are useful in variety of applications requiring high resolution images, which include cartography, infrastructure planning, urban & rural development, utility management, natural resources inventory & management, disaster management. The objective of Indian nano-satellites INS-1A & 1B is to demonstrate new technologies and miniaturization of spacecraft.


    Total 101 nano satellites from six foreign countries were launched in this mission. These satellites are: BGUSat (Israel), Al-Farabi-1 (Kazakhstan), PEASSS (The Netherlands), DIDO-2 (Switzerland), Nayif-1 (UAE), 8 Lemur satellites (USA) and 88 Dove satellites (USA). These nano satellites from foreign countries were launched under a commercial arrangement between Antrix Corporation Limited (Antrix), the commercial arm of ISRO and the foreign customer.


    Antrix has earned a revenue of about half of the cost of launch vehicle in terms of foreign exchange.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
