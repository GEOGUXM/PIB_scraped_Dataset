    According to National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB), Ministry of Home Affairs, the specific information is not maintained by the Bureau separately regarding the tendency to commit crime among adolescents due to influence of mobile and internet, thereby increasing the number of juvenile offenders in the country. However, under Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Special & Local Laws (SLL) during the year 2013, 2014 and 2015, there were 35,861, 38,565 and 33,433 cases of children in conflict with law under various cognizable crimes showing a mixed trend. A total of 20 cases in 2014 & 17 cases in 2015 were registered against children in conflict with law under the Information & Technology Act, 2000.
    
    The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act) has come into effect from 15.01.2016 repealing the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000. New ‘JJ Act’ includes special provisions to address heinous offences committed by children above the age of 16 years to act as a deterrent for child offenders committing such crimes. The Act is a comprehensive law with strengthened provisions for children in conflict with law and those in need of care and protection. For the first time, offences have been clearly defined and classified in the Act as petty, serious and heinous. Special provisions have been made to tackle child offenders committing heinous offences in the age group of 16-18 years, which will act as a deterrent.
