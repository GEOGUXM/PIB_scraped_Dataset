      Progress of Soil Health Card

        The Government has introduced Soil Health Card Scheme in all States/UTs with an aim to assist all State Governments to evaluate fertility in all farm holdings across the country and issue soil health cards to farmers regularly in a cycle of 2 years. Soil Health Cards provide information to farmers on nutrient status of their soil along with recommendations on appropriate dosage of nutrients to be applied for improving soil health and its fertility.


        Against the target of 2.53 crore soil samples, the States have collected 2.71 crore samples and tested 2.05 crore samples to print about 11 crore soil health cards. As on 14.03.2017, 5.66 crore cards have been distributed to farmers. State-wise details are given below.


        A study conducted by National Productivity Council (NPC) in 2016 has shown that 84% of farmers have expressed that they have applied the nutrients recommendations suggested in soil health card that have proven to be beneficial to them in reducing the cost of cultivation and improving productivity of crops.
