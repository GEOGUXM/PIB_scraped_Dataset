      Posted On: 25 MAR 2017 6:28PM by PIB Delhi


    Some media reports have appeared recently to the effect that the Govt. of India has agreed to carve out a larger Nagaland State by taking away the territories of the states contiguous to Nagaland. Such reports are erroneous. It is clarified that there is no such agreement or decision of the Govt. of India.
