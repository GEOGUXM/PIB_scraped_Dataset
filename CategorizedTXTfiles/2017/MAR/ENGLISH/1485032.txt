    All personnel inducted into High Altitude regions are given adequate training in mountain craft, ice craft, and survival in glaciated terrain to cope with any eventuality like avalanches. Best quality of winter clothing and equipment is procured to prevent weather related casualties. Modern means of conveyance like snow scooters are utilized to ensure timely reaction to any eventuality and reduce fatigue. A number of specialized equipments have also been deployed in the avalanche prone areas.


    For avalanche warning, 56 High Altitude Observatories and 55 Automatic Weather Stations have been set up by DRDO in Uttarakhand, Himachal and J&K. Further, based on advisories received from Indian Meteorological Department in respect of cyclones & floods and from Indian Tsunami Early Warning Center in respect of Tsunami, timely dissemination of information is ensured to all formations.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri A. Vijaya Kumar in Rajya Sabha today.
