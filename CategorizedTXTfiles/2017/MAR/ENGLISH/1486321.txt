      Posted On: 31 MAR 2017 3:47PM by PIB Delhi

      

        Several measures have been taken by Indian Railways to modernize / upgrade rail coaches of Mainline trains in the recent past. These include provision of improved interiors with upgraded fire retardant properties, Bio Toilets, Balanced Draft Gear for reducing the jerks in Centre Buffer Couplers (CBC) fitted coaches, Light Emitting Diode (LED) lighting, Screw less Fibre-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) or Aluminium Composite Panel (ACP) paneling for interiors, etc. Besides, a policy decision has been taken to proliferate Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches. LHB type coaches are based on new technology and are of superior design as compared to conventional Integral Coach Factory (ICF) type coaches.


        In addition to the above, Humsafar trains having additional amenities in the coaches have recently been introduced for providing comfortable Air-Conditioned III Tier travel. Humsafar coaches have better passenger amenities, improved aesthetics, passenger announcement system, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) based surveillance system, etc. Also, Antyodaya and Deen Dayalu coaches for unreserved travel, having additional amenities in the coaches, have been introduced in service. These coaches have features such as cushioned luggage racks, drinking water dispenser, pleasing interior and exterior with anti-graffiti measures, enhanced number of mobile charging points, etc.


        Targets set for the manufacture of Humsafar/Deen Dayalu and Antyodaya coaches for the next three years, which are available now, are as under:
