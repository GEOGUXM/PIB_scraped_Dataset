      Posted On: 28 MAR 2017 4:24PM by PIB Delhi


    Government of India is aware of the rising problem of multi-drug resistance in the country which at times may lead to deaths due to invasive infectious complications. To address the problem of growing Antimicrobial Resistance, Government of India has launched the ‘National Programme on Containment of Antimicrobial Resistance’ under the 12th Five Year Plan with National Centre of Disease Control (NCDC) as the coordinating centre. Under this Programme, IEC activities are being conducted for creating awareness in community for rational use of drugs.

    
    Drugs and Cosmetics Rules of 1945 are amended to control the overuse of 24 antibiotics and other drugs through over-the counter sale without prescription by the pharmacies. Schedule H1 drugs can be sold only on production of a valid prescription by registered medical practitioner and a warning to this effect is printed on the label in a Box with Red border and Rx symbol.
    
    Pharmacists now have to document identity of the patient, contact details of the prescribing doctor and the name and dispensed quantity of the drug in a separate register, subject to regular inspections by drug control officials. This register has to be retained for at least three years.
    
    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
