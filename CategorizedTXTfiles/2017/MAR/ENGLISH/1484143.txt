      The Minister also stated that the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) is prepared by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on the recommendation of the core committee appointed by them. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has revised the NLEM, 2015 on 23 rd December, 2015 and subsequently Schedule – 1 of DPCO, 2013 was revised by Department of Pharmaceuticals on 10 th March, 2016. There were 348 medicines listed in NLEM 2011. A total of 106 medicines have been added, and 70 medicines have been deleted to prepare NLEM 2015, which now contains a total of 376 medicines.


      
      In a written reply to another question in Rajya Sabha today, Shri Mandaviya informed thatthe initial price fixation/price determination is not under the purview of Government. Government only controls price of medical devices declared as essential drugs. Out of the 23 medical devices regulated as “Drugs” under Drugs & Cosmetics Act & Rules thereunder,3 devices namely ‘Condom’, ‘Intra Uterine Device (IUD) containing copper’ & ‘Coronary Stents’ have been included in the Schedule-I of DPCO, 2013 and are under price control. The remaining 20 medical devices are categorized as non-scheduled formulations under DPCO, 2013 and therefore, no price has been fixed for these non-scheduled medical devices. However, manufacturers are not allowed to increase the price of these 20 medical devices more than 10% per annum, the Minister added.
