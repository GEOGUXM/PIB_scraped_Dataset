    The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has constituted a Committee on 22nd November, 2016 to review the existing road accident data collection and reporting format so as to make recording and reporting of road accident data more accurate, objective and ensuring coverage of all relevant information regarding actual circumstances or underlying causes of road accidents for undertaking preventive measures to reduce road accidents. The Committee includes experts from IIT-Delhi, IIT- Kharagpur, WHO, senior officers from Police and Transport Departments of states, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and officers of the Ministry. The committee submitted its recommendations on 9 February, 2017. The committee has recommended uniform Road Accident Recording Format to be adopted by the police in all States and U.Ts and a set of the corresponding annual road accident data Reporting Format ( 17 tables) in which States and U.Ts would furnish data to the Ministry. All the states & U.Ts have been requested to adopt the road accident recording format immediately so that they would be able to furnish the annual road accident data in the new reporting format to Transport Research Wing, Ministry of Road Transport & Highways w.e.f calendar 2017. States and U.Ts have also been requested that the formats for recording/reporting of road accidents data may be shared with the members of the State Road Safety Council and other stakeholders involved in the State Road Safety Action Plan. It is expected that the newly designed road accident recording and reporting formats would facilitate police in capturing all the relevant information on road accident and transmit the information to the Ministry and other stakeholders for taking corrective measures to reduce road accidents in the country. This information was given by the Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways Shri Pon. Radhakrishnan in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today. ***** UM/NP/MS
