      Posted On: 17 MAR 2017 5:47PM by PIB Delhi

      

    All kinds of medical facilities such as primary medical healthcare, specialist medical care and super specialists medical care are provided to armed forces personnel including ex-servicemen and their dependents.


    
    At present, treatment facilities through Ayurvedic and Unani system of medicine are not available in the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) hospitals for the reasons that the structure of AFMS revolves on combat medical and surgical requirements and the basic ethos of keeping the service personnel fighting fit at all times.


    
    However, it has been decided to open two AYUSH lifestyle centres â€“ one at Army Hospital (Research & Referral), Delhi and another at Air Force Hospital, Hindon on trial basis.


    
    This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply toDr. A. Sampathin Lok Sabha today.
