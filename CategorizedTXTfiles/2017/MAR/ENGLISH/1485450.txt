    The Ministry of Women & Child Development is implementing Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme, Scheme for Adolescent Girls (AGs) and Maternity Benefit Programme (MBP) as direct targeted interventions to address the problem of malnutrition in the country.
    
    An amount of Rs.5866.68 Crores, Rs.6711.90 Crores & Rs.8048.72 Crores released to States/UTs for Supplementary Nutrition under ICDS Scheme for the year 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16 respectively. Similarly, Rs.575.36, Rs.610.32 Crores, Rs. 470.40 Crores was released to States/UTs under Scheme for Adolescent Girls for the year 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16 respectively. An amount of Rs 232.05 Crores for the year 2013-14, Rs. 343.13 Crores for the year 2014-15 and Rs.233.46 Crores for the year 2015-16 was also released to States/UTs under Maternity Benefit Programme.
    
    Under the ICDS scheme, there is a provision of Supplementary Nutritious Food to the beneficiaries. Take Home Ration is given to Pregnant Women & Lactating Mothers, children (6 months - 3 years) and severely malnourished children and Hot Cooked Meals are provided to children (3 - 6 years). ICDS is a universal and a self-selecting scheme. Those who visit Anganwadi Centers and enroll themselves can avail these services.
    
    As per the recent report of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) – 4, 2015-16, 35.7% children under 5 years of age are underweight and 38.4% are stunted indicating a reduction from the previous data captured in NFHS – 3, 2005-06, which reported 42.5% children under 5 years of age as underweight and 48% stunted.
    
    Malnutrition is not a direct cause of death but contributes to mortality and morbidity by reducing resistance to infections. As per the Sample Registration Report (SRS), 2010-13 of Registrar General of India, the major causes of deaths of children are - Prematurity & low birth weight (29.8%); Pneumonia (17.1%); Diarrhoeal disease (8.6%); Other Non-Communicable Diseases (8.3%); Birth asphyxia & birth trauma (8.2%); Injuries (4.6%); Congenital anomalies (4.4%); Ill-defined or cause unknown (4.4%); Acute bacterial sepsis and severe infections (3.6%); Fever of unknown origin (2.5%) and all other remaining causes (8.4%). However, the data regarding death of children and women due to malnutrition is not maintained by this Ministry.
    This information was given by Minister of State for Women & Child Development, Smt Krishna Raj in reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
