      Scrapping the Post of Orderlies in the Army
      Posted On: 21 MAR 2017 2:37PM by PIB Delhi


    Indian Navy and Air Force do not have the system of Orderlies.
    
    Sahayaks (Orderlies) are combatant soldiers and provide support to officers and JCOs in the Army when serving with units or HQ functioning on War Establishments. Thus there is no separate category of Sahayaks. A Sahayak has clearly defined military duties and forms an integral part of the organisation structure of a unit and has specific functions during war and peace. In addition to their duties as soldier, they provide the essential support to authorized officers and JCOs, both in peace and war to enable them to fully attend to their assigned duty. During operations in the field areas, Officer / JCO and the Sahayak act as buddies in arms. One covers the movement of the other buddy and protects him in operation where support has to be total i.e. mental, physical and moral.
    
    The nomenclature was changed from ‘Orderly’ to ‘Sahayak’ in 1983 based on the directions of COAS, when combatants were entrusted the responsibility of supporting the officers.
    
    This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shrimati Wansuk Syiem in Rajya Sabha today.
