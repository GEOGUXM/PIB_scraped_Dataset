      Posted On: 10 MAR 2017 3:30PM by PIB Delhi


    Recruitment rallies are conducted in different parts of the country to provide opportunity to youth from these areas to join the Armed Forces. Recruitment in the Armed Forces is a continuous process. Efforts are made to cover entire country including remote, border, tribal and hilly areas.
    
    Presently there is no proposal to open any new recruitment centre.
    
    For recruitment in Army, certain relaxations in physical and educational standards are available for candidates of tribal / hilly and other backward areas. In the case of Navy and Air Force, there is no provision for relaxation in educational standards. However, some relaxation in height is given to candidates from certain areas.
    
    This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shrimati Kamla Devi Paatle and Shri Harinarayan Rajbhar in Lok Sabha today.
