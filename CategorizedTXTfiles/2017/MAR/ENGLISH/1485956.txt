      Posted On: 29 MAR 2017 2:42PM by PIB Delhi


    National Mission on Monuments & Antiquities (NMMA) gets the documentation of antiquities and monuments done by outsourcing through Documentation Resource Centers (DRCs) which comprise Universities, State Archaeological Departments, Endowment Boards, Research Institutes, Trusts, NGOs etc. These DRCs are identified by NMMA in association with State Level Implementation Committees (SLIC) constituted for the purpose in different States. The projects awarded to DRCs are monitored by SLICs, Finance Committee and Monitoring Committee. The DRCs get the documentation done in house or through outsourcing as the case may be.
    
    There is already in built mechanism for certification of data by subject experts before submission of data to NMMA. The data received in NMMA is further verified by the subject experts before release of funds and uploading of the documented data.
    
    This information was given by Dr. Mahesh Sharma, Minister of State for Culture and Tourism (Independent Charge) in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
