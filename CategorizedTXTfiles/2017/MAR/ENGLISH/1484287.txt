    It has come to the notice of Ministry of Women & Child Development (MWCD), Government of India that certain unauthorized elements/individuals are distributing illegal forms in the name of cash incentive under BetiBachaoBetiPadhao (BBBP) Scheme. The scheme has no provision for ANY CASH INCENTIVES FOR INDIVIDUALS. BBBP scheme focuses on challenging mindsets and deep rooted patriarchy in the societal system in order to value girl child, strict enforcement of PC & PNDT Act, advancing education of the girl child: focus is on issues of women empowerment on a life cycle continuum.


    
    The Ministry of Women & Child Development has taken up this matter with the State Government Authorities where this illegal activity has taken place namely Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Punjab and Bihar. Repeated warnings have been publicized several times by this Ministry in print media as well as electronic media. The Ministry had advised that no personal details should be shared in this regard and no one should subscribe to such fraudulent schemes. However, still some people are falling prey to such frauds and buying forms or disclosing personal details in name of such non-existent benefits being falsely offered in the name of BBBP scheme.
    Keeping in view the public interest and gravity of the matter, it is informed to general public that the case has now been referred to Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for investigation into the matter.
