      Posted On: 21 MAR 2017 4:54PM by PIB Delhi

      The Government of Telangana has requested for increasing the seats in Legislative Assembly of Telangana State from 119 to 153 as envisaged in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014.
      
      The issue was taken up with the Ministry of Law & Justice, who in turn sought the opinion of Attorney General who had observed that as per Article 170(3) of the Constitution, the total number of seats in the Assembly of each State shall not be readjusted till after the first Census is published post the year 2026. Therefore, unless and until Article 170 is amended to bring up in line with Section 26 of the A.P. Reorganisation Act, 2014, the increase in the number of seats cannot be given effect.
      
      This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question by Shri Prabhakar Reddy Kotha in the Lok Sabha today.
