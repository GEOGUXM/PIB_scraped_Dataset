      The National Archives of India would be celebrating its 127th Foundation Day on Saturday, 11 March 2017 in their premises at Janpath, New Delhi. It is an Attached Office under the Ministry of Culture and established on 11 March 1891 at Calcutta as the Imperial Record Department. Professor G.W.Forrest was the first officer in charge of the department. Following the transfer of the capital from Calcutta to Delhi in 1911, the present building of the National Archives of India was constructed in 1926 which is designed by Edwin Lutyens. The transfer of all records from Calcutta to New Delhi was completed in 1937. The National Archives of India has one Regional Office at Bhopal and three Records Centers at Bhubaneswar, Jaipur and Puducherry.
      On the occasion of 127th Foundation Day, an exhibition entitled Revolutionary Patriots (1905-1947) would be inaugurated by Shri NK Sinha, Secretary, Ministry of Culture at 4.30 p.m. which is based on original documents and proscribed literature. This exhibition has been organised with a two-fold objective: to sensitize the younger generation to the sacrifices made by the revolutionaries in their fight for independence from the imperial rule and to inculcate a sense of archival awareness among the public. It will remain open for public till 10 April 2017 from 10.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. during working days only.
      Dr. TCA Raghvan, Former High Commissioner of India to Pakistan will deliver Foundation Day Talk on Foreign Policy and National Archives of India. The Foundation Day Celebrations would be concluded with a cultural evening where Alha Samrat Vindhyasharan Shukla will present patriotic poems in folk Alha format at 6.15 p.m.in the presence of invited audience.
