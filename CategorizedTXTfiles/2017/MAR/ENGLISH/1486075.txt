      Repatriation of Pakistani and Bangladeshi Citizens
      Posted On: 29 MAR 2017 4:56PM by PIB Delhi


    During the last three years i.e 2014, 2015 and 2016, more than 250 Pakistani nationals and 1750 Bangladeshi nationals were deported to their respective countries after due process of identification.
    
    Illegal immigrants enter into the country without valid travel documents in clandestine and surreptitious means. There is no accurate data with regard to number of Bangladeshi citizens illegally residing in the country. Some Bangladeshi migrants may be prone to Islamic fundamentalism and become easy prey for militancy, communal conflicts, anti-India elements like Pak ISI etc. Besides, illegal Bangladeshi immigrants are found to be involved in cases relating to theft/burglary, smuggling, human trafficking and drugs trafficking etc.
    
    The Government has been strengthening Indo-Bangladesh Border to prevent infiltration of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Besides, bilateral mechanisms such as Joint Working Group on Security, Director General level talks between Border Security Force (BSF) and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), Home Secretary level talks and Home Minister level consultations are in place between the two countries to address problems arising from illegal border crossing, transborder crimes like smuggling of drugs, Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN), human trafficking etc. Further, deportation of illegal Bangladeshi migrants is also undertaken by the State Governments who have been delegated the power of detection and deportation of the illegal foreign migrants under the Foreigners Act.
    
    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question by Shrimati Jaya Bachchan in the Rajya Sabha today.
