    At present, Ministry of Food Processing Industries does not have any scheme for assisting setting up of food processing units including mango processing units. However, under the Scheme for Technology Upgradation/ Establishment/ Modernization of Food Processing Industries implemented during 11th Plan, the financial assistance has been provided for setting up of new food processing units as well as Technological Upgradation and Expansion of existing units including mango processing units under Fruit & Vegetable sector in the country.
    
    This scheme was subsequently subsumed in the Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS)-National Mission on Food Processing (NMFP) with effect from 01.04.2012 till 31.03.2015. Thereafter, the said scheme got delinked from Government of India’s assistance and it was left to the State Governments to decide on its continuance from their increased resources as per recommendation of 14th Finance Commission. The committed/spillover liabilities of cases received upto end of 11th Plan are being considered by Ministry of Food Processing Industries for sanction of Grant – in - aid during the 12th Plan under the said scheme as per availability of funds and merits of proposals
    
    However, under the Skill Development initiative, this Ministry has been assisting Food Industry Capacity and Skill Initiative (FICSI) since September, 2015 to impart training in food processing sector under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY). Besides, National Institute of Food Technology Entrepreneurship and Management (NIFTEM), a deemed de novo university & Indian Institute of Crop Processing Technology (IICPT) under the administrative control of Ministry of Food Processing Industries also conduct programmes/courses on Skill Development (under self-financing, sponsored and PMKVY) and entrepreneurship for the youth, farmers, self–help groups besides running their normal educational courses and other academic research and outreach activities.
