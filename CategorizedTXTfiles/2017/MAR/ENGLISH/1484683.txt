    Safety of women in the country is of utmost priority for the Government. The Government is endeavouring to put in place effective mechanisms to provide safe environment for women. The Criminal Law (Amendment), Act 2013 has been enacted making the punishment more stringent for offences like rape. Provision for increased penalty for gang rape and causing serious injury to the victim resulting her to remain in a vegetative state have been made. New offences like acid attack, sexual harassment, voyeurism and stalking, disrobing a woman have been incorporated in the Indian Penal Code. Certain changes have also been introduced in the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.PC) and the Indian Evidence Act, like the recording of statement of the victim of rape and sexual assault by a woman police officer and provisions to ensure that the victims ( below the age of eighteen) is not confronted by the accused at the time of trial. Government has also enacted the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 to provide a safe and secure environment to women at the workplace.


    Apart from the above, t he schemes of One Stop Centre and Women Helpline for women affected by violence funded from Nirbhaya Fund to facilitate access to justice are being implemented since 1 st April, 2015. Further, t he Ministry of Women and Child Development is also administering Swadhar Greh Scheme for relief and rehabilitation of women in difficult circumstances, including the victims of rape.

    Under the Central Victim Compensation Fund (CVCF) Scheme, financial assistance of Rs.200 Crores as one time grant has been sanctioned from Nirbhaya Fund and allocated to States/UTs for compensating women victims on crimes committed against victims on acid attacks, rape, trafficking, etc.
