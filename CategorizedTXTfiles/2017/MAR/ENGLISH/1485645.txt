    The Ministry of AYUSH has implemented a programme ‘Homeopathy for Healthy Child’ (HHC) through Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH), an autonomous organization under Ministry of AYUSH. The programme has been undertaken on pilot basis in ten blocks of six districts in five states of the country. The program is also extended in two blocks of Jharkhand and Rajasthan under tribal sub-plan.

    The program has 2 components namely, ‘Homoeopathy for teething complaints in children’ and ‘Integration of Homoeopathy with Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK)’. The component on ‘Homoeopathy for teething complaints in children’ focuses on children in the age group of 6 months to 3 years and aims at promotion of healthy teething by using Homoeopathic bio-chemic medicines. Teething associated problems such as diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, irritability are treated with homeopathic medicines. The component on ‘Integration of Homoeopathy with RBSK’ focuses on children in the age group of 0 to 18 years and aims at screening, early detection and early intervention of defects, delays, deficiencies and diseases identified under RBSK. The program is being undertaken on pilot mode in 10 blocks in 6 districts as follows:

    The program is also extended in two blocks of Jharkhand and Rajasthan under tribal sub-plan.
    The field workers in these blocks have been trained by experts from homoeopathy, pediatrics and dentistry or community medicine for identifying the common problems associated with primary teething and the use of homoeopathic medicine kits. They have been provided with the medicine kits and data recording registers for data collection and compilation. All these programs were conducted in coordination with the district and block level authorities.
    More than 50,000 children have been enrolled. The nodal officers of the program have been trained on undertaking screening of children for 4 Ds (defects, developmental delays, deficiencies and diseases) as outlined under the RBSK.

    This information was given by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) for AYUSH, Shri ShripadYesso Naik in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
