      Posted On: 30 MAR 2017 4:53PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government of India has enacted comprehensive legislation i.e., the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, to handle child sexual abuse. This Act has come into force on 14th November 2012. Such cases are processed as per provisions of POCSO Act, 2012.

    
    The Hon’ble Minister, WCD (in the context of POCSO) had requested all States/UTs Education Minister/Administrator to circulate animated short film “Komal” that deals with the topic of child sexual abuse, in all the schools under State/UT Governments to sensitize the children on what constitutes an “inappropriate touch”. The Ministry has again requested Ministry of Human Resource Development for taking necessary action for compulsorily showing ‘Komal’ video in all the schools all over India. Apart from above, the Department of School Education & Literacy had issued Guidelines/Advisory dated 9th October, 2014 to all the States/UTs to ensure the safety and security of children in schools. National Commission for Protection of Child Rights(NCPCR) and Childline India Foundation(CIF) have also organised seminars/workshops to sensitise all stakeholders.
    
    This information was given by Minister of State for Women & Child Development, Smt Krishna Raj in reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
