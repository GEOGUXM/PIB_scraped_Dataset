      Posted On: 17 MAR 2017 4:34PM by PIB Delhi


    The pulses procured and imported by the designated agencies are stored in their own godowns as well as godowns hired from CWC/SWC/Private parties. The storage capacity available with FCI, CWC, SWC and other state agencies along with private warehouses available in the country are adequate for storing the buffer stock of pulses.


      As on 14.03.2017, Government has created a buffer of around 15.33 lakh tonnes of pulses including 4.01 lakh tonnes contracted for imports. The variety-wise, State-wise stock available is given below in table.
