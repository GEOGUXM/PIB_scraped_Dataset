        General Bipin Rawat, Chief of the Army Staff (COAS), on 27 March 2017 at South Block, New Delhi, released the book ‘Home of the Brave ’ on the history of Indian Army’s Counter Insurgency Force, the Rashtriya Rifles (RR). The book is authored by Mr Nitin A Gokhale, Defence & Security Analyst and Brig S K Chatterji (Retired). The event of release of the book was attended by the COAS, Director General of the Rashtriya Rifles, other senior officers from Directorate General of the Rashtriya Rifles along with the authors.


        Home of the Brave traces the early history of the RR, its organization, including its raising and subsequent deployment in Punjab, the North East and in Jammu & Kashmir. The RR, a formidable Counter Insurgency Force, has won many laurels in the operations. In addition to fulfilling its primary mandate of securing the Nation, the Force has also conducted several softer measures to win hearts and minds of the people- a critical and valuable practice that the Indian Army has embraced. The book also reflects upon the role of the RR in strengthening the professionalism of the Indian Army and military ethics and values throughout its rank and file.


        Home of the Brave will serve as an authentic record of achievements of the RR for all the Army units and Army training institutions. For defence policy planners, research scholars and military historians, this book provides factual and well chronicled information.
