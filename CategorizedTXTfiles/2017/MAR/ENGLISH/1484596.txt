      Posted On: 16 MAR 2017 3:22PM by PIB Delhi


        The Ministry of Textiles is implementing ‘Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (ATUFS)’ with effect from 13.01.2016, for a period of seven years. Under ATUFS, there is a provision of one-time capital subsidy for eligible benchmarked machinery at the rate of 15% for garmenting and technical textiles segments with a cap of Rs. 30 crore and at the rate of 10% for weaving, processing, jute, silk and handloom segments with a cap of Rs. 20 crore. An outlay of Rs. 17,822 crore has been approved for seven years to meet the committed liabilities of Rs. 12,671 crore and Rs. 5151 crore for new cases under ATUFS. While ATUFS covers Capital Investment Subsidy (CIS), earlier schemes of TUFS had provisions both for interest reimbursement as well as Capital Subsidy. Further ATUFS is targeted towards focused segments like garmenting and made-ups with additional 10% subsidy. The segments which have achieved desired level of modernization, i.e. spinning etc., have been excluded under ATUFS.


        So far 2036 UIDs have been issued under ATUFS with expected employment generation of 45,659 against investments reported of Rs. 5225.86 crore.


        TUFS is a Central Sector Scheme being implemented on pan India basis. However, under the Scheme subsidy is given to the units/entities through nodal financial institutions and not through the state govt. The details of the fund provided under TUFS during the last three years and current year are given below:
