      Posted On: 29 MAR 2017 5:23PM by PIB Delhi


    

    It has been decided to replace the Centre Buffer Couplers (CBCs) of LHB (Linke Hofmann Busch) type coaches fitted with Single pack draft gear or Floating plate draft gear with CBCs with Balanced draft gear to mitigate the jerks in the train ride.

    
    Sanction for the retrofitment of improved design CBCs with Balanced draft gear in 1350 LHB coaches is already available under Rolling Stock Programme (RSP) and provision of the same in 500 more LHB coaches has been sought under RSP 17-18 at a cost of ₹ 5 lac per coach. The approximate cost for this work in 1850 LHB coaches at a cost of ₹ 5 lac per coach would be ₹ 92.5 crore.
    
    All new passenger coaches (Mainline) are being manufactured with CBCs with Balanced draft gear.
    
    It has been decided to proliferate coaches with CBCs with Balanced Draft Gear on Indian Railways irrespective of specific trains/routes.
    
    This Press Release is based on the information given by the Minister of State for Railways Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha on 29.03.2017 (Wednesday).
