    The State of Manipur is facing problems of disruption of supplies of essential commodities due to economic blockade called by United Naga Council (UNC) since November 1, 2016. To deal with the situation, various steps have been taken by Central Government in a coordinated way with the State Government. 135 Coys of CAPFs were deployed in the State of Manipur for Internal Security, Law & Order and border guarding duties up to October, 2016.
    
    Additional 40 Coys of CAPFs have been provided to Manipur for opening of National Highways and restore transportation of supplies of essential commodities. As NH-2 has been blocked for goods transportation, CAPFs are assisting the State Government in bringing supplies through NH-37. Government of India has organized tripartite talks with Government of Manipur and United Naga Council (UNC) three times on 15.11.2016, 3.2.2017 and 7.3.2017. There has been directions from Govt. of India and meetings had been held at the level of Union Home Minister and MoS (Home) with Chief Minister and State Government of Manipur. There has been continuous monitoring and review of situation in Manipur at the highest level. Need-based airlifting of Petroleum Products to the state of Manipur to ease supplies position has been done.
    
    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in written reply to a question by Smt. Ambika Soni and Dr. T. Subbarami Reddy in the Rajya Sabha today.
