      Posted On: 24 MAR 2017 12:34PM by PIB Delhi


    Health is a State subject and thereby the State concerned is primarily responsible for setting up of Super Specialty Hospitals. However, Central Government has been supplementing the efforts in the domain of tertiary health care by way of setting up of Institutes of National Importance like All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and up-gradation of existing State Government Medical Colleges/Institutions through construction of Super Speciality Blocks/Trauma centres under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY).


    At present, six new AIIMS are functional at Patna (Bihar), Raipur (Chhattisgarh), Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh), Bhubaneshwar (Odisha), Jodhpur (Rajasthan) and Rishikesh (Uttarakhand) and 6 more AIIMS will be instituted at RaeBareli (Uttar Pradesh, Mangalagiri (Andhra Pradesh), Kalyani (West Bengal), Nagpur (Maharashtra), Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh) and Bathinda (Punjab) as per the approval by Cabinet. Further, setting up of new AIIMS at Himachal Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Jammu, Kashmir, Gujarat and Jharkhand have been announced.


    In addition, 73 Government Medical Colleges/Institutes have already been approved for up-gradation in different phases under PMSSY. Under these upgradations, superspeciality blocks are being created in these Government Medical Colleges/Institutes.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
