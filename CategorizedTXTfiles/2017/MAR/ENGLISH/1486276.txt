    The status of ongoing food processing projects in the country and funds released to these projects, State/UT-wise is given in the Annexure.


    The Government has approved setting up of 42 Mega Food Park projects, 133 Cold Chain projects, 38 Abattoir projects, 101 Food Testing Laboratories and assistance to 7381 food processing industries for technology up-gradation/ establishment/ modernization under major schemes of the Ministry. Out of the approved projects, 8 Mega Food Parks have been made operational, 97 Cold Chain Projects have been completed, 7 abattoir projects have been made operational and 61 Food Testing Laboratories have been completed. On an average, each Mega Food Park attracts investment of about Rs.100 Crore in Common Facilities and leverage an additional investment of about Rs.250 Crore in processing units leading to an annual turnover of about Rs.450 - 500 Crore and creation of direct/ indirect employment of about 5000 persons. Each Mega Food Park on being fully operational also benefits about 25000 farmers. These completed Mega Food Parks have the capacity of 10.25 Lakh MT of agri-horti produce processing of the value of Rs. 2,500 Crore. Cold Chain infrastructure created by the MOFPI supported completed projects is 3.65 lakh MT of Cold Storage, Controlled Atmosphere (CA)/ Modified Atmosphere (MA) storage, Deep Freezer, 81.90 MT per hour of IQF and Spiral Freezer, 81.35 MT per batch of Blast Freezer, 38.85 LLPD Milk storage and 528 numbers of reefer carriers. The completed abattoirs have the capacity for processing of 3405 large animals, 19650 sheep/goat, 2510 pig and 14000 poultry per day. Besides, the Ministry is also implementing schemes for Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP), Research and Development, Promotional Activities and Strengthening of Institutions to enhance capacity and competitiveness of the food processing sector.


    For timely completion of the projects, Ministry has suitably modified the guidelines of the Schemes from time to time in consultation with the stakeholders, involved State Governments in the process of selection of the projects, making available affordable credit through NABARD, classified food processing as agriculture activity for primary sector lending and made available various fiscal concessions. The State Governments are also impressed upon to put in place an effective single window clearance system for one-point clearance of all the approvals. The regular project-wise monitoring is undertaken at various levels in the Ministry to expedite implementation.
