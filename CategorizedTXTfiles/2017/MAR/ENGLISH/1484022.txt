      Posted On: 09 MAR 2017 8:23PM by PIB Delhi

    The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has incorporated Indian Highway Management Company Limited (IHMCL) to expedite the implementation of Electronic Fee Collection (EFC). National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has been engaged to work as Central Clearing House (CCH) to implement inter-operability so that several banks could participate in the EFC programme. As on 03.03.2017, the participating banks are SBI, KVB, ICICI, AXIS, IDFC and Equitas SF Bank. As on 03rd March 2017, total 3,47,200 electronic tags have been issued for fee collection on National Highways. The Road users are being encouraged to use electronic means for payment of user fees for seamless travel through fee plazas. Government has also notified the use of pre-paid payment instruments vide Notification G.S.R 1114 (E) dated 02nd December, .2016 for collection of user fee from road users. This is to permit road users to opt for available cashless modes of payment. NHAI has facilitated the Concessionaire and Contractor to use POS machines for collection of user fees through credit & debit card. Since, FASTag is not mandatory for payment of user fees for use of National Highways; therefore, no target/deadline has been fixed. This information was given by the Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways Shri Pon. Radhakrishnan in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today. ***** UM/NP/MS
