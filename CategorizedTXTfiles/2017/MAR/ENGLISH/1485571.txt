      Posted On: 24 MAR 2017 12:26PM by PIB Delhi


    Under National Health Mission (NHM), family planning is one of the major activities like other activities. The funds are approved activity-wise but are allocated/released to States pools-wise under NHM. Hence, a statement indicating SPIP (State Programme Implementation Plan) Approval and Expenditure towards the activity family planning under NHM State-wise during the previous year and current financial year is given below:
