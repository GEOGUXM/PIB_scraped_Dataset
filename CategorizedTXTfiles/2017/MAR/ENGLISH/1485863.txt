      Growth of CPSEs
      Posted On: 28 MAR 2017 4:36PM by PIB Delhi


    As per information available in the Public Enterprises Survey 2015-16, the turnover of all operating Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) increased from 2009-10 to 2013-14 and declined during 2014-15 and in 2015-16. The reasons for the decline are enterprise specific. Some major reasons are resource crunch, low capacity utilization, old plant and machinery, stiff competition, weak marketing etc.
    
    The CPSEs operate in a global environment. The decisions on strategic and day to day management of the CPSEs are taken by the Board of CPSEs and the concerned administrative ministries. Maharatna and Navratna CPSEs have been given enhanced autonomy and delegation of powers to incur capital expenditure, to enter into technology joint ventures / strategic alliances, to raise capital from domestic and international markets and to establish financial joint ventures etc.
    
    This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Lok Sabha today.
