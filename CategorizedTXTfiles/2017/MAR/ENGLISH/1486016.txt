        Zonal Railways have been using Hydraulic Rescue Devices (HRDs), procured from foreign countries including Germany, at accident sites as a part of rescue efforts whenever needed. Available details of usage for the last 3 years are as below:


        1. Central 04.05.2014


        2. North Eastern 30.09.2014


        3. Northern 20.03.2015

        The first hour from the time of accident is referred to as the “Golden Hour”. Rescue of passengers from the accident involved coaches within the Golden Hour depends on many factors, mainly reaching of HRD equipment to the accident site. After reaching the accident spot, Hydraulic Rescue Devices have been successful when used for rescue operation. The total time taken for such rescue operation by Hydraulic Rescue Devices has been varying depending upon the type of accident and site conditions.


        The competency/viability of these HRDs has been assessed during the past rescue operations. HRDs have performed successfully during rescue operations.


        This Press Release is based on the information given by the Minister of State for Railways Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha on 29.03.2017 (Wednesday).
