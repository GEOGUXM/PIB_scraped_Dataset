      Posted On: 16 MAR 2017 4:29PM by PIB Delhi


    Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has successfully launched 104 satellites, in a single launch, onboard India’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle “PSLV-C37’ on February 15, 2017 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), Sriharikota. These satellites include- (i) India’s Cartosat-2 Series Satellite (weighting 714kg) as primary payload, (ii) two Indian Nano-Satellites viz. INS-IA&IB(together weighing 18.1 kg) and (iii) 101 foreign nano-satellites together weighing 645.9 kg) from six counties as co-passengers. This was the 38th successful PSLV mission in a row, which has once again demonstrated the versatility and reliability of the PSLV vehicle. While PSLV has already established itself as a preferred launch vehicle, in its class, in the global satellite market, this mission is expected to further strengthen the commercial footprint of PSLV in the global market for launch services, especially for smaller satellites.
    
    During the last two years, Antrix Corporation Limited (Antrix), the commercial arm of ISRO, has earned a foreign exchange of 76.5 Million Euros and 4.5 Million USD from foreign countries through launching of their satellites on-board PSLV. As of now, the spare capacity available onboard PSLV, after meeting the national requirements, is provided for commercial launch services. ISRO will continue to make available the spare capacity available on its launch vehicles for commercial launch services through Anrix.
