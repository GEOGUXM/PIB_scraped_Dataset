      Posted On: 23 MAR 2017 4:11PM by PIB Delhi


    The current installed nuclear power capacity in the country comprises of 21 reactors with a total capacity of 5780 MW. One more reactor, KKNPP-2 (1000 MW) is presently generating infirm (non-commercial) power and commencement of its commercial operation will take the nuclear installed capacity to 6780 MW. The details of their location, date of start of commercial operation and capacity are as below:

    * Under extended shutdown for techno-economic assessment for continued operation.


    ** Presently, generating infirm (non-commercial) power and is expected to be in commercial operation soon.


    # Presently, the units are under long shutdown for Enmasse Coolant Channel Replacement (EMCCR) and Enmasse Feeder Replacement (EMFR)

    In the current financial year 2016-17 (upto February 2017), the electricity generation from nuclear power on commercial basis was 34136 Million Units. In addition, Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project (KKNPP), Unit-2 has generated 2086 Million Units of infirm power (non-commercial) during this period. Thus, 36223 Million Units of electricity has been generated from nuclear power as against 903694 Million Units from fossil fuel sources (source: CEA), which is about 4% of the energy generated from fossil fuel in the current financial year 2016-17 (up to Feb-2017).
