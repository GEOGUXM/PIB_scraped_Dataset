      8-year-old World Kickboxing champion Tajamul Islam here today called on Union Sports Minister Vijay Goel. The meeting took place as Tajamul wanted to thank shri Goel for his prompt response after she posted a video last week which showed poor infrastructure for kickboxing players. Shri Goel wrote to J&K Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti and urged her to take action to provide better facilities for the players. An amount of Rs.10 lakhs was released by the J&K Sports Council after the state government received union Sports Minister letter.

      
      Tajamul was accompanied by her father and Kickboxing Federation officials and expressed her happiness after meeting the Sports minister. The officials also requested Goel to grant them recognition so that the federation can work in a better and efficient manner.
      
      Shri Goel lauded Tajamul’s efforts and congratulated as well as thanked her father for encouraging Tajamul who is making India proud in the global sporting arena at such a young age. Shri Goel also gave some gifts to the little kickboxing wonder.
      
      Shri Goel said, ‘Our government and Sports Ministry is committed to do the best for our budding young players and that’s one reason I wrote to Chief Minister Ms. Mufti after Tajamul posted a video on social media about the lack of facilities for the players. We will continue to provide the best facilities for our players and our doors are always open for them if they have any issues or problems’
