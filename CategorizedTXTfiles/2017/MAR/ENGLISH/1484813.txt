      Posted On: 17 MAR 2017 6:07PM by PIB Delhi

      The 7 th Central Pay Commission (CPC) recommended the following on disability pension:-
      The Commission is of the considered view that the regime implemented post 6 th CPC needs to be discontinued, and recommended a return to the slab based system. The slab rates for disability element for
      100 percent disability would be as follows:
  Ranks                             Levels          Rate per month (INR)
                                                                        
  Service Officers                  10 and above    27,000              
                                                                        
  Honorary Commissioned Officers
                                
  Subedar Majors / Equivalents      6 to 9          17,000              
                                                                        
  Subedar / Equivalents         
                                
  Naib Subedar / Equivalents    
                                
  Havildar / Equivalents            5 and below     12,000              
                                                                        
  Naik / Equivalents            
                                
  Sepoy / Equivalents           
                                
      The above recommendation has been accepted and Resolution dated 30.09.2016 issued accordingly.
      The 6 th CPC dispensation of the calculation of disability element on percentage basis, however, continues for civil side which has resulted in an anomalous situation. The issue has accordingly been referred to the Anomaly Committee. However, the disability element which was being paid as on 31.12.2015 to the eligible defence service pensioners will continue to be paid till decision on the recommendations of Anomaly Committee is taken by the Government.
      This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri Dr. Kirit P. Solanki and Shri Rajan Vichare in Lok Sabha today.
