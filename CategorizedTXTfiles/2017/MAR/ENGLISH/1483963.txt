      Under SAI Schemes the female wrestlers are also inducted for regular training on residential and non-residential basis. Presently, there are 135 female wrestlers (49 residential and 86 non-residential) under training in SAI centres.

      To exclusively nurture female wrestlers, SAI has recently adopted Jog Maharaj Vyayamshala, Pune under its Akhara Scheme and 19 talented female wrestlers are being trained in the Akhara.

      Wrestling being a traditional Indian sport, efforts are being made to admit more number of female wrestlers under SAI schemes, since there is enormous potential among the Indian women in the discipline of wrestling
