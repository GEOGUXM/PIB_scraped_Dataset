      Measurement of Emissions
      Posted On: 20 MAR 2017 4:34PM by PIB Delhi


    “Emission Intensity is calculated by dividing ‘Total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions’ by ‘Total Gross Domestic Product (GDP)’ of a country. India has committed to reduce emissions intensity of its GDP in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Goal of reducing Emissions intensity of GDP allows a country to reduce its emissions even while its GDP grows. The NDC was framed by adopting an inclusive process of consultations with key Ministries, State Governments, civil society organisations, think-tanks, and technical and academic institutions. Each country has chosen its own metric for climate action. Many other developing countries also use Emission Intensity of GDP for the purpose. Each Mission under the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) is independently anchored by respective Ministries in-charge of implementing the Mission. Following the Paris Agreement, the Missions continue to contribute to the declared goal of reduction of emissions intensity of GDP as also other sustainable development goals outlined in the NDC.”


    This information was given by Minister of State (Independent Charge) of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Anil Madhav Dave, in reply to a written question in Rajya Sabha today.
