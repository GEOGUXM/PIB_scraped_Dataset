    “Studies have been conducted by the Ministry of Earth Sciences to understand the natural variability of the marine ecology of the Indian Ocean. The studies include satellite-derived chlorophyll concentration and productivity patterns in the ocean.

    
    Studies broadly indicate that temperature rise in the Ocean lead to redistribution of marine species and reduction in marine biodiversity.
    
    Measures have been initiated by Government through various Ministries and institutions to address the challenge. The Ministry has undertaken schemes related to coral reef conservation as well as protection and management of marine species through setting up of designated Marine Protected Areas and other projects in association with coastal communities.”
    
    This information was given by Minister of State (Independent Charge) of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Anil Madhav Dave, in a reply to a written question in Lok Sabha today.
