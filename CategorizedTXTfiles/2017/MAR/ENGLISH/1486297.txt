    Force accretion of Armed Forces is an ongoing process dictated primarily by capabilities to be achieved and threat perception. Accordingly, Government has sanctioned a number of proposals for accretion of manpower in the recent years.


    A number of measures have also been taken to meet the shortage of manpower in the Armed Forces including by sustained image projection, publicity campaign to create awareness among the youth on the advantages of taking up a challenging and satisfying career, as also by augmenting the training infrastructure of the Armed Forces.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri M Raja Mohan Reddy in Lok Sabha today.
