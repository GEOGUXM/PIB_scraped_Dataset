    ISRO has launched two high resolution earth observation satellites ‘Cartosat-2 Series satellite’ onboard Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle ‘PSLV-C34’ on June 20, 2016 and onboard ‘PSLV-C37’ on February 15, 2017 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), Sriharikota. These Cartosat-2 series satellites are placed in a sun synchronous orbit with a designed mission life of 5 years. The main objective of these satellites is to provide high resolution images of earth’s surface at sub-meter resolution (Black & White image) and at 2 meter resolution (4-band coloured image). The images obtained from these satellites are useful in variety of applications requiring high resolution images, which include cartography, infrastructure planning, urban & rural development, utility management, natural resources inventory & management, disaster management.


    Cartosat-2 series satellite does not transmit continuous and uninterrupted live pictures. However, the capability exists to provide 1 minute video of specific area of interest.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
