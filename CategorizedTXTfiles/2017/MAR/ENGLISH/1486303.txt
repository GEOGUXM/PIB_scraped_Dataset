    Every aircraft accident / incident is thoroughly investigated by a Court / Board of Inquiry to ascertain the cause of accident and the recommendations of the completed Court / Board of Inquiry are implemented. Defence Forces have taken various preventive measures like invigoration of Aviation Safety Organization, streamlining of accident / incident reporting procedure, analytical studies and quality audits of the aircraft fleets to identify vulnerable areas to avoid aircraft accidents. Accident prevention programmes have been given an added thrust to identify risk prone / hazardous areas specific to the aircraft fleets and operational environment to ensure safe practices / procedures.
