      Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has been apprised of the Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) signed between India and:

      
      (i) Indonesia for cooperation in youth and sports matters, and
      
      (ii) Kyrgyz Republic for cooperation in the field of youth development.
      
      The MoUs envisage organizing Youth Exchange Programmes with Indonesia and Kyrgyz Republic, and cooperation in other youth and sports related matters.
      
      International Youth Exchange programmes promote exchange of ideas, values and culture amongst youth and help in developing international perspective among the youth. Further, these Programmes promote peace and understanding, and strengthen friendly relations between countries. Cooperation in other youth and sports-related matters also helps in youth development and sports promotion in partner countries.
      
      The benefits arising from bilateral exchange programmes in the field of Youth and Sports would be equally available to all youth irrespective of their caste, religion and gender.
      
      The selection of youth for participation in youth exchange and other programmes shall be done in an objective and transparent manner and the outcomes of the programmes under the MoUs shall be open for public scrutiny.
      
      Youth exchange and other programmes will help in developing international perspective among the youth and expanding their knowledge and expertise.
