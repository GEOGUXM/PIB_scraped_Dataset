      Posted On: 29 MAR 2017 2:59PM by PIB Delhi


    There are 31 Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) under the Department of Heavy Industry (DHI). Out of which, 21 including Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) are running in losses. Details including profit and loss and balance sheets of these CPSEs are available in Volume – I and Volume – II respectively of the Public Enterprises Survey 2015-16 which has already been laid on the Table of both Houses of Parliament on 21st March, 2017.
    
    DHI is undertaking appraisal of the status of each CPSEs regularly with a view to assessing the prospects of revival on case to case basis. As a part of this exercise, while profit making CPSEs require further strengthening, the loss making CPSEs having the potential of being turned around need to be revived. Those CPSEs which have been chronically sick and are not found revivable on sustainable basis are to be disinvested or closed after payment of due compensation to employees. NITI Aayog has been entrusted the responsibility to critically review the performance of loss making CPSEs and give their recommendation on the future of these CPSEs.
    
    This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Rajya Sabha today.
