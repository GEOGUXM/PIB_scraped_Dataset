        Smt. Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary, MeitY had said that “ The idea of having Hackathon is that the students across the country have the opportunity to contribute their creativity to solve some of the country problem and outcome of this exercise will probably help us to actually come up with innovative solutions of many issues which we face in India today”


        Smart India Hackathon 2017 is expected to become the ‘world’s biggest open innovation model’ that other countries can replicate. Since Hackathon as a concept is new to India, AICTE arranged 26 awareness workshops across India to sensitized students about Smart India Hackathon 2017. These workshops helped connect students with problems of our nation. Out of the 7531 idea submissions received for the 598 problems posted by 29 govt. department, 1266 ideas have been shortlisted for the ‘Grand Finale’ on April 1 & 2, 2017, during which these teams will work nonstop for 36 hours to build products based on their ideas across 26 locations in India. For the first time, 10,000+ youngsters (6 students & 2 mentors per team) will work non-stop for 36 hours to develop products for our nation. To ensure the success of Smart India Hackathon 2017, multiple online training sessions have been organized in hope of training 30,000+ students.
