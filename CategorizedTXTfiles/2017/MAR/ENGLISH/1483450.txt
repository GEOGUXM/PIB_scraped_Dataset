      No Net Impact on LPG Consumers
      Posted On: 01 MAR 2017 11:05AM by PIB Delhi

      With effect from 1st March, 2017, non-subsidized price of LPG cylinder has increased by Rs.86. This is in line with the rise in global LPG product prices. However, there will be no impact on the LPG consumers receiving subsidized refills. To illustrate with an example, the consumer will pay Rs.737 for a new refill in Delhi w.e.f. 1st March, 2017 and will receive subsidy amount of Rs.303 in his/ her account and the net price for the consumer will be Rs.434, which remains unchanged.
      Thus, there will be no net impact of the increase in price of non-subsidized cylinder on the LPG consumers receiving subsidized refills.
