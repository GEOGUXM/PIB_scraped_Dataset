      Posted On: 15 MAR 2017 5:40PM by PIB Delhi


    Airports Authority of India owns and maintains 8 airports in Madhya Pradesh including a Civil Enclave at Gwalior.
    
    Development of airports to international standards is a continuous process and is undertaken by Airports Authority of India (AAI) from time to time depending upon commercial viability, traffic demand, availability of land, demand from airlines, etc. Bhopal, Indore and Khajuraho airports in Madhya Pradesh have already been upgraded to international standards with new integrated terminal buildings and other requisite facilities for international operations.
    
    Indian carriers are free to mount services from any point in India to foreign destinations as per the respective bilateral air service agreements. However, actual operations are always guided by traffic demands and commercial judgement of airlines.
    
    This information was given by Minister of State for Civil Aviation, Shri Jayant Sinha in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
