    Ministry of Health and Family Welfare periodically conducts National Family Health Surveys, which inter alia measures the nutritional indicators in the country in order to assess the prevalence of malnutrition. As per the recent report of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) – 4 conducted by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in 2015-16, there is a clearcut decline in malnutrition levels in the country. In NFHS-4, 35.7% children under 5 years of age are underweight and 38.4% are stunted indicating a reduction from the previous NFHS – 3 conducted in 2005-06, which reported 42.5% children under 5 years of age as underweight and 48% stunted.


    To measure nutritional status of children, WHO growth charts are used at the Anganwadi Centers, using weight-to-age (underweight) as an indicator under Integrated Child Development Services Scheme (ICDS) of Ministry of Women and Child Development.


    Data on prevalence of malnutrition in the country is captured under the National Family Health Surveys (NFHS) periodically conducted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Under NFHS, data is collected from a nationally representative sample of population and the results are then statistically analysed. The latest round of NFHS was conducted in 2015-16.


    This information was given by Minister of Women & Child Development, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi in reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
