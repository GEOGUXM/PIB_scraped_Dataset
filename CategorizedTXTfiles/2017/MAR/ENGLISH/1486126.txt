Reasons for depletion of ground water resources is mainly due to growing population, urbanization and industrialization.

The average annual per capita water availability in the years 2001 and 2011 was assessed as 1820 cubic meters and 1545 cubic meters respectively, which may reduce further to 1341 and 1140 in the years 2025 and 2050 respectively.
