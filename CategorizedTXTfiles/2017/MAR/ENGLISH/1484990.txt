      The erstwhile Planning Commission had supported Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati to evaluate the UGC Career Oriented Courses on employability of the students in South India. The university submitted its report in 2014 to NITI Aayog. The report, inter-alia, reveals that the list of courses organised by colleges are market oriented, need based, able to promote skills in the areas concerned and career oriented. However, the Report further recommends that vocational training on par with regular education should be provided through career oriented courses to increase the coverage of students.
      University Grants Commission (UGC)’s scheme titled “Introduction of Career Oriented Courses in Universities and Colleges” aims at introducing career and market oriented, skill enhancing add-on courses at undergraduate level which have utility for jobs, self-employment and empowerment of the students. Career oriented courses under this scheme follow a progressive approach and involve field work/project work/practical training activities so as to make the course useful in upgrading the skill sets of students. Further, the syllabi of courses are prepared by the universities/colleges keeping in view the subject specific academic needs and market requirements to make the courses relevant. Besides this scheme, the UGC also implements three other career oriented schemes viz. Community Colleges, B.Voc Degree Programme and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya KAUSHAL Kendras to improve the quality of skill oriented education for ensuring employability of students and making them industry ready.
      This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey today in a written reply to a Lok Sabha question.
