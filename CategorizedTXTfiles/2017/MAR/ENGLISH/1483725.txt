      The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee in his message on the eve of International Women’s Day, which is observed every year on March 8, has said: -
      “On the occasion of International Women’s Day, I extend warm greetings and best wishes to women in India and in all parts of the world.
      With their incomparable compassion, tolerance and hardwork, generations of Indian women have made an invaluable contribution to the development and progress of our country. Government of India has introduced and implemented historic legislations and far sighted programmes for their empowerment and equal participation in nation building. ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ is an important initiative to prevent female foeticide and provide educational opportunities for female children in India.
      On this day, I call upon the people of India to reaffirm their commitment to gender equality and the true empowerment of women. Let us rededicate our efforts to give them all the support they need to develop to their full potential, realise their aspirations and enjoy the safety, dignity and unfettered equality that is their sacred right.”
