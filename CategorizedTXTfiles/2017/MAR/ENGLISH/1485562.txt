      There are large numbers of clinics in the country offering surrogacy services. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2016, introduced in the Lok Sabha on 21.11.2016, envisages provisions to govern surrogacy in India. Commissioning of surrogacy in India has been prohibited for foreigners, Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) and Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) vide Ministry of Home Affairsâ€™ Order No. 25022/74/2011-F-I (Vol.III) dated 3rd November, 2015.

      The major objectives of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2016 are to regulate surrogacy services in the country and to provide altruistic ethical surrogacy to the needy infertile Indian couples. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2016 contains adequate provisions, inter alia, to safeguard the interests of surrogate mothers and children born through surrogacy in India.

      The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
