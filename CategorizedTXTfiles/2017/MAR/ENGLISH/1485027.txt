      Posted On: 21 MAR 2017 1:16PM by PIB Delhi

      
      Under the existing provisions of the Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and Registration of Food Businesses) Regulations, 2011, it is mandatory to display the true copy of the license at a prominent place at all times within the premises where the Food Business Operator carries on the food business. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has come out with a revamped Food Safety Display Board (FSDB) covering information viz., (i) FSSAI registration/license number which the customer can verify at FSSAI website (ii) basic food hygiene and safety tips to inform the customers and the food handlers about the important food safety and hygiene requirements (iii) food Safety declaration indicating that the restaurant abides by regulations under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (iv) consumer feedback system informing the consumer about various options for sending feedback to FSSAI through WhatsApp, SMS or give feedback on FSSAI App. These FSDBs have a holistic 360 degree approach wherein a consumer can know about the Safe Food Practices; Food Handlers can know about the Good Manufacturing Practices/ Good Manufacturing Practices to be followed; and the Regulatory Staff can know about the inspection check points, thus covering the gap. FSDBs have till now been prepared for six sectors namely-restaurants, street food, milk retail, meat retail, food retail sector and fruit & vegetable retail. Presently, these Food Safety Display Boards are being displayed voluntarily by 14 major and few minor Food Business Operators across their chain covering around 2000 outlets across India.

      The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
