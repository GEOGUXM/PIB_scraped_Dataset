      Leading up to International Women’s Day on March 8, 2017, the Ministry of Women and Child Development has initiated a social media campaign - #WeAreEqual - targeted at raising awareness about gender discrimination. The campaign will culminate into the celebration of International Women’s Day marked by the prestigious Nari Shakti Award ceremony, in which the Hon’ble President will honour individuals and institutions for their exemplary contribution to women’s empowerment.


      The campaign takes a positive approach, engaging both men and women across the cross-section of the society and reflects their personal effort at creating a more equal society. The Ministry’s Facebook and Twitter handles have received an overwhelming number of posts by social media users with the hashtag #WeAreEqual, reaching 2.6 crore persons since its inception last month. The posts show everyday examples of how men and women of India are sharing more responsibilities and standing up for equal rights and opportunities.


      The #WeAreEqual campaign is gaining momentum with the partnership by prominent personalities such as film actors Mr. Amitabh Bachchan, and Ms. Dia Mirza; sportspersons Ms. Mary Kom and Mr. Sangram Singh and ISRO scientists Ms. K Thenmozhi Selvi, Ms. Subha Varier and Ms. Minal Rohit among others.


      Ms. Vasu Primlani, a triathlete, comedian, musician and Nari Shakti Awardee, has also joined the campaign by preparing a rap music video on the theme of gender equality. Several other organisations like Change.org, Breakthrough, Girls Count , Facebook #Hundred Women Achievers have partnered with the Ministry to carry forward the message of the campaign.


      The Ministry has also produced an insightful short video reflecting the views of the general public on gender discrimination and the need for equality.
