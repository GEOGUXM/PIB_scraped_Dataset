    As per the provisions of Indian Medical Council Act, 1956, the Ministry receives applications for starting new Medical Colleges and forwards them to the Medical Council of India (MCI) for making recommendations. The MCI after making necessary scrutiny/assessment of the Colleges makes recommendations to the Central Government. In case MCI sends recommendation for disapproval, the Ministry grants an opportunity to the applicant colleges before taking a decision. The last date for sending recommendations by MCI is 30.04.17 and for issuing permission by the Central Government is 31.05.17 for the academic year 2017-18. The applications received for the year 2017-18 are at different stages of processing.
