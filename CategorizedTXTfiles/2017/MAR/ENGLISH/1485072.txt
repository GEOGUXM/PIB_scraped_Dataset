    The Union Government has decided that in all cases where the service of the retiring Central Government employees has been verified, payment of the accumulation under Savings Fund of Central Government Employee Group Insurance Scheme (CGEGIS) will be made without awaiting confirmation of deduction of each monthly subscription of CGEGIS. This would help in timely payment of accumulations under the Savings Fund of the CGEGIS. The necessary Orders in this regard have been issued by Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance on 17.03.2017.
    
    Often delay occurs in payment of dues to the retiring Central Government employees as the existing procedure requires confirmation of deduction of each monthly subscription to the scheme. The present decision of the Union Government is a step towards simplification of procedure as well as to ensure timely payment of savings along with interest under CGEGIS, to the Central Government employees at the time of retirement.
    
    Under the Central Government Employees Group Insurance Scheme, 1980, the accumulations under the component of Savings Fund together with interest thereon are payable to the employees on retirement or on cessation of employment with the Central Government or to their family on death while in service.
