        Minister for Information & Broadcasting Shri M .Venkaiah Naidu has said that Photography as a communication tool was an influential medium to spread awareness and ensure Good Governance. Photographs along with Social Media had been a potent combination in today’s digital world. The ‘Selfie with Daughters’ campaign launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi came out to be a powerful instrument of social change. This way of posting photos created a powerful impact on societal behaviour and ingrained cultural traditions. The Minister stated this at the inaugural function of 6 th National Photography Awards ceremony here today. Col. Rajyavardhan Rathore, Minister of State for Information & Broadcasting, Shri Ajay Mittal, Secretary I&B were also present on the occasion.


        Shri Naidu, while speaking on the role of photographs as a powerful medium of communication, quoted that “A picture is worth a thousand words”. They formed a means of artistic statement that provided insight into the thought and mental makeup of the communicator, while enabling them to transcend the limitations and boundaries of the linguistics of a written or spoken language.


        Elaborating further Shri Naidu said that photographs were a powerful language which spoke to our emotions and became a part of our legacy. The photograph of a 3 year old dead Syrian child washed ashore on a beach changed the entire world opinion on the Refugee Crisis thereby shaking collective consciousness of the humanity.


        Speaking about the basic essence of photography, Shri Naidu said that there were no specific set of rules to take a good photograph. A photographer was not bound by technique or theory. They were free to interpret and capture the subject the way they likes. It was imperative to have the right amalgamation of art, angle and aperture to capture and process pictures, which only comes through years of practice.


        On the role of fast changing technology in communication domain, Shri Naidu said that the Internet has brought out the resurgence of visual image into our everyday communication. Digital cameras and cell phones with integrated cameras have generated an explosion of images into everyone’s lives. Social Media has provided a new platform to people to Share, Communicate and Inform through photographs.
