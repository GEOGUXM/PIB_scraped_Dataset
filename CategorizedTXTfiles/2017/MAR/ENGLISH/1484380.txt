    As per available information, the National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) and States Police have registered cases to investigate the alleged links of individuals with ISIS and 75 individuals (Kerala-21, Telangana -16, Karnataka – 9, Maharashtra – 8, Madhya Pradesh – 6, Uttarakhand – 4, Uttar Pradesh – 3, Rajasthan – 2, Tamil Nadu -4 and 1 each from Jammu & Kashmir and West Bengal), have so far been arrested.

      A few incidents of unfurling of flags of ISIS by some misguided youth were noticed on different occasions in Jammu & Kashmir in the recent past. ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ being State subjects, the State Government concerned has been directed to take appropriate action against such elements as per relevant provisions of Law.
      As per the reports of the security agencies, few educated youth, who got attracted to the ISIS ideology, did so through social media.
      This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in written reply to a question by Ch. Sukhram Singh Yadav, Smt. Chhaya Verma and Shri Vishambhar Prasad Nishad in the Rajya Sabha today.
