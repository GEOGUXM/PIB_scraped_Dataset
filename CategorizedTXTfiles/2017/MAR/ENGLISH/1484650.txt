          The salient features of the proposed above mentioned Bills are:
          (I) The Admiralty (Jurisdiction and Settlement of Maritime Claims) Bill consolidates the existing laws relating to admiralty jurisdiction of courts, admiralty proceedings on maritime claims, arrest of vessels and related issues. The Bill confers admiralty jurisdiction on High Courts located in coastal states of India and this jurisdiction extends upto territorial waters. The jurisdiction is for adjudicating on a set of maritime claims listed in the Bill. In order to ensure security against a maritime claim a vessel can be arrested in certain circumstances.
          (II) The Merchant Shipping Bill, 2016 is a revamped version of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958. The provisions of the Bill will simplify the law governing the merchant shipping in India. Further, certain redundant provisions will be dispensed with and remaining provisions will stand consolidated and simplified so as to promote ease of doing business, transparency and effective delivery of services. The significant reforms that will usher in, upon enactment of the Bill, are augmentation of Indian tonnage, promotion of coastal shipping, introduction of welfare measures for seafarers, registration of vessels not covered under any statute. The Bill also incorporates all International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Conventions/Protocols in the Indian laws up-to-date.
          (III) The Major Ports Authorities Bill, 2016 inter alia provides for the following namely:-
          (i) to constitute the Board of Port Authority for each Major Port in the place of the Board of Trustees;

          (iii) to empower the Board of Port Authority to raise the loans and issue securities for the purposes of the capital expenditure and working capital requirements of such Port Authority;
          (iv) to constitute an Adjudicatory Board for adjudication of disputes among Major Ports, Public Private Partnership concessionaries and captive users;
