      A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Chennai Port Trust and the Government of Puducherry in New Delhi today for handling EXIM cargo originating from Puducherry Port hinterland. The MoU envisages that Chennai Port Trust will assist Puducherry Port in handling its export cargo. The cargo originating from Puducherry Port hinterland will be transported through sea mode to Chennai Port for shipping to overseas destinations through mainline and feeder vessels. Similarly, the import cargo destined to Puducherry hinterland will be unloaded at Chennai Port and will be moved in small coastal vessels to Puducherry Port, thus reducing total logistics costs, besides easing road congestion.
      
      The MoU was signed by Chairman, Chennai Port Trust and Chief Secretary, Government of Puducherry in the presence of Shri Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister for Shipping, Road Transport & Highways, Sh. V. Narayansamy , Chief Minister, Puducherry, Shri Mansukh L. Mandaviya, Union Minister of State for Shipping, Road Transport & Highways and other dignitaries. Speaking on the occasion Shri Gadkari said that this MoU will facilitate handling of EXIM cargo - to and from Puducherry hinterland through Chennai Port. Around 5 Lakh to 10 Lakh tonnes of cargo is expected to be handled. He said that once this arrangement becomes operational, road congestion will reduce substantially as almost 300 trucks will go off road. He said that this move will also bring down pollution levels significantly.
      
      The MoU is expected to promote industrial growth in the region, generate substantial employment and attract investment by major industries.
