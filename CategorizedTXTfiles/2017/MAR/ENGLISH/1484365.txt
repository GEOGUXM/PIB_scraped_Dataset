    (iii) 2015-16 - 1.3% (RE)


    (iv) 2016-17 - 1.4 % (BE)


    The Draft National Health Policy 2015 envisages raising public health expenditure progressively to 2.5% of the GDP.


    Public health and hospitals is a state subject. However under NHM, Government provides technical and financial support to states to strengthen their healthcare system.


    National Health Mission (NHM) implementation framework seeks to achieve health goals through strengthening state health systems, facility based service delivery, expanding the outreach services, strengthening community The processes, addressing social determinants of health, providing social protection against cost of care through provision of free drugs, diagnostics, diet and transport; and building a robust health management information system.


    To ensure proper utilization of funds and to provide health care facilities to all the citizens of the country, the Government has taken several steps including, inter-alia :


    Organizing periodical review meetings/Joint Monitoring Missions, conducting external surveys, undertaking Common Review Missions (CRM) on annual basis, conducting monthly concurrent audit and annual audit of the State/District Health Societies, Performance Audit by CAG, Mid-Term Appraisal by Planning Commission (Now NITI Aayog) etc.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
