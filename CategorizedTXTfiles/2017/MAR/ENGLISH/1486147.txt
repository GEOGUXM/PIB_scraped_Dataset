      Aadhaar identification for MDMS
      Posted On: 30 MAR 2017 3:39PM by PIB Delhi


    Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDMS) is covered under the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016. A notification has been published in the Gazette of India (Extraordinary) dated 28th February, 2017 which came into effect in all States and Union Territories except in the States of Assam, Meghalaya and the State of Jammu & Kashmir. As per the notification, the beneficiaries are required to furnish proof of possession of Aadhaar number or undergo Aadhaar authentification and if not enrolled for Aadhaar, shall have to apply for Aadhaar enrolment by 30th June, 2017 provided that till the time Aadhaar is assigned to the individual, he/she shall be entitled for benefit subject to the production of the following identification documents, namely:


    (i) If he or she has enrolled, his or her Aadhaar Enrolment Id slip; or


    (ii) A copy of his or her application made for Aadhaar Enrolment and an undertaking by the parent or legal guardian that the child is not availing benefit from any other school and any one of the documents mentioned in the notification.


    The use of Aadhaar as identity document would not affect the health of the children as it brings in transparency and efficiency for delivery of services or benefits or subsidies, simplifies the Government delivery processes and enables beneficiaries to get their entitlements directly to them in a convenient and seamless manner. The Aadhaar also obviates the need for producing multiple documents to prove oneâ€™s identity.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Shri Upendra Kushwaha today in a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question.
