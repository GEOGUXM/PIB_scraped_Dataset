        In addition, other benefits such as liberalised family pension, death-cum-retirement-gratuity, etc. are granted as per extant rules.


        In case of civilians, as per Ministry of Home Affairs scheme, an amount of Rs. 5 lakh is given for each death or permanent incapacitation to the Nok/victims of cross-border firing.


        Appropriate retaliation to these ceasefire violations have been carried out wherever necessary. During ceasefire violations, the inhabitants of border villages, which are vulnerable to shelling/firing, are shifted to safer locations to prevent any loss of life. All arrangements are made by the District administration for free boarding, lodging, medicare, water, electricity, food, sanitation and transport to safer places in such cases.


        The defences along the border are adequately fortified to withstand enemy fire. Continuous improvements, including the usage of modern technology, in the defences are made to make them more robust and resilient to enemy fire.


        This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri Rahul Shewale and others in Lok Sabha today.
