      Posted On: 20 MAR 2017 5:30PM by PIB Delhi

      

    State Private Universities are established by Acts of their State legislatures and they are regulated by their respective acts. However, in order to ensure transparency, quality and standard of education in State Private Universities, University Grants Commission has notified UGC (Establishment of and Maintenance of Standards in Private Universities) Regulations, 2003. As far as private deemed universities are concerned, UGC has notified UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2016.
    
    Both the Regulations have provisions for periodic inspection of such Universities by UGC. The UGC Expert Committees (including representatives from the concerned Statutory Councils) conducts inspection of these Universities to assess the fulfilment of minimum criteria in terms of programmes, faculty, infrastructural facilities etc., as laid down by the UGC and deficiencies, if any, observed during inspection are communicated to respective universities for rectification.
    
    In the year 2016, UGC has notified the new UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2016 in which several new measures viz. stringent eligibility criteria to ensure quality of education, fixing of time frame for processing of application of Deemed to be University status as well as application for new Off-Campus / new Department / new Course, reducing the Government interference in the Institutes, several students welfare measures, provision of removal of Vice chancellor etc. have been incorporated.
    
    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey today in a written reply to a Lok Sabha question.
