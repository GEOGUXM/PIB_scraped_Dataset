    “The National Forest Policy 1988 envisages taking afforestation programme with particular emphasis on fodder Development and in consonance with this, the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change is implementing centrally sponsored scheme National Afforestation Programme (NAP) for eco-restoration of degraded forests in the country through people’s participation. The scheme is implemented through the State Forest Development Agency (SFDA) at the state level, Forest Development Agency (FDA) at the forest division level and the Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMCs) at the village level. The scheme provides various models for eco-restoration, one of them being Pasture Development/Silvipasture, which aims for improvement of grasslands and enhancing the fodder availability.

    
    During the last three years an amount of Rs.41.78 crores has been sanctioned for pasture development under NAP which includes 13,013 hectares of the new area under the specific model. Further, the National Mission for a Green India (GIM) is a recent initiative by the Ministry under the National Action Plan on Climate Change that aims at protecting and enhancing India’s forest cover to counter the perils of climate change. The Mission supports the restoration of grasslands and pastures, Agro-forestry and Social Forestry.
    
    However there is no specific suggestion for earmarking of area for growing grass and fodder under the above schemes.”
    
    This information was given by Minister of State (Independent Charge) of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Anil Madhav Dave, in reply to a written question in Lok Sabha today.
