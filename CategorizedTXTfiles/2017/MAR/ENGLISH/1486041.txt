        The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) has assessed shoreline change using the satellite data acquired during 1972-2000 in order to calculate the shoreline change rate. Shoreline change rate is one of the input parameters to calculate the coastal vulnerability index along the Indian coast.


        This work was carried out during the period 2007-2009 at INCOIS using the satellite data acquired during 1972-2000, State wise shoreline change rate calculated at 1:100000 scale are given below

        Satellite data were taken from open source Landsat of USA and Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite of India data available at INCOIS from other projects were used; hence no expenditure was incurred towards data specific to this work.
