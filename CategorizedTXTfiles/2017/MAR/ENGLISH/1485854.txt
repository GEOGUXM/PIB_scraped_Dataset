    The Food Safety and Standards (FSS) Act was enacted in 2006 to establish the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). FSSAI has the mandate for laying down science based standards for articles of food and to regulate their manufacture, storage, distribution, sale and import and to ensure availability of safe and wholesome food for human consumption. The work relating to implementation and enforcement of the FSS Act, 2006 and regulations thereunder has primarily been entrusted to the Food Safety Departments of the States/Union Territories. Appropriate structures have been established in the States/Union Territories for enforcement of the Act.

    
    Regulation 2.2 of the Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labelling) Regulations, 2011 prescribes the general requirements for labelling of pre-packaged food which includes the clause regarding nutritional information on food labels.
    
    Regular surveillance, monitoring, inspection and random sampling of food products is undertaken by the officials of Food Safety Departments of the respective States/ UTs to ensure that food products comply with the laid down standards. In cases, where food samples are found to be non-conforming to the prescribed standards, recourse is taken to penal provisions under Chapter IX of the FSS Act, 2006.
    
    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
