          Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production

          Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall have been given in following sub-sections:


          1.1 Crude oil production by ONGC during February, 2017 was 1741.31 TMT which is 4.89% lower than the monthly target and 2.17% lower when compared with February, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April, 2016 - February, 2017 was 20286.65 TMT which is 2.10% lower than target for the period and 1.0% lower than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


          Ø Delay in deployment of MOPU-Sagar Samrat.


          Ø Delay in implementation of “Development of Western Periphery of MHS (ZC)” Project.


          Ø Natural decline in matured fields of Western Offshore.


          Ø GEB Power shutdown in Ahmedabad and Mehsana.


          Ø Ceasure of wells in North Kadi & Laghnaj fields and closure of high water cut wells.


          Ø Assam: ASEB power shutdown.


          1.2 Crude oil production by OIL during February, 2017 was 260.32 TMT which is 13.45% lower than monthly target but 5.73% higher than production in February, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April, 2016 - February, 2017 was 2964.83 TMT which is 5.45% lower than target for the period but 0.26% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Shortfall in production was mainly due to less than planned contribution from high producing areas like Greater Hapjan, Shalmari and Moran fields primarily on account of rise in water cut.


          1.3 Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during February, 2017 was 795.64 TMT which is 3.51% lower than the monthly target and 8.52% lower than February, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April, 2016 - February, 2017 was 9666.53 TMT which is 2.66% lower than target for the period and 7.34% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


          Ø RJ-ON-90/1: Less production from Mangala as one power fluid pump tripped on 21.02.2017. Few high water cut wells closed at Mangala, poor reservoir performance of Bhagyam


          Ø CY-ONN-2002/2: Under Test Production


          Ø Underperformance of KG- OSN-2001/3


          Ø Natural Decline in CB-OS/2 and Panna-Mukta


          Natural Gas


          2 Natural gas production during February, 2017 was 2522.54 MMSCM which is 9.95% lower than the target for the month and 1.66% lower when compared with February, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production during April, 2016 - February, 2017 was 29146.41 MMSCM which is 5.99% lower than target for the period and 1.90% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II. Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of February, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April, 2016 -February, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

          Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production

          2.1 Natural gas production by ONGC during February, 2017 was 1773.12 MMSCM which is 5.84% lower than the monthly target but 2.44% higher when compared with February, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC during April, 2016 - February, 2017 was 20115.67 MMSCM which is 2.58% lower than the cumulative target but 2.98% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year. Shortfall in production was mainly due to less than planned production from Daman & C-26 Cluster due to evacuation constraint (export lines to TCPP platform are not completed) and natural decline from Bassein field


          2.2 Natural gas production by OIL during February, 2017 was 225.18 MMSCM which is 6.37% higher than the monthly target and 3.07% higher than February, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April, 2016 - February, 2017 was 2685.53 MMSCM which is 0.78% lower than the cumulative target but 3.92% higher than the production during the corresponding period of last year.

          2.3 Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during February, 2017 was 524.24 MMSCM which is 25.80% lower than the monthly target and 14.85% lower when compared with February, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April, 2016 - February, 2017 was 6345.21 MMSCM which is 17.04% lower than the cumulative target and 16.42% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:
          Ø Underperformance of wells in KG- OSN-2001/3
          Ø Underperformance of Sohagpur West CBM block, closure of few wells for maintenance in Raniganj East CBM block.
          Ø Closure of 2 wells in D1D3 field in KG-DWN-98/3.
          Ø RJ-ON-90/1: Less production from Mangala as one power fluid pump tripped on 21.02.2017. Few high water cut wells closed at Mangala, poor reservoir performance of Bhagyam

          Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)

Cumulative production during April, 2016-February, 2017 was 224055 TMT which is 1.89% higher than the target for the period and 5.95% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III. Company-wise production for the month of February, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April, 2016 - February, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

          Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production

          3.1 PSU Refineries’ production during February, 2017 was 10726.35 TMT which is 3.61% higher than the target for the month but 3.07% lower than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by PSU refineries during April, 2016 - February, 2017 was 125254.79 TMT which is 1.22% higher than the target for the period and 8.79% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some PSU refineries are as under:

          v IOCL, Paradip: Throughput is lower due to coke upliftment issue.
          v IOCL, Haldia: Throughput is lower due to VGO stock build-up.
          v IOCL, Digboi / Guwahati: Lower availability of Assam crude.
          v BPCL, Kochi: DHDT was run at a lower charge due to non-availability of hydrogen from BOO and Build-up of VGO.
          v CPCL, Manali: Deferred shutdown of Manali Refinery due to OHCU shutdown.
          v CPCL, CBR: Evacuation constraints in CBR refinery.
          v MRPL, Mangalore: Throughput lower due to shutdown taken in CDU -1 to repair heater coil supports.

          3.2 Production in JV refineries during February, 2017 was 1315.90 TMT which is 5.78% higher than the target for the month and 9.49% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April, 2016 - February, 2017 was 15532.79 TMT which is 10.54% higher than the target for the period but marginally lower (0.05%) than the production during corresponding period of last year.


          3.3 Production in private refineries during February, 2017 was 7007.80 TMT which is 3.18% lower than the target for the month and 3.16% lower when compared with February, 2016. Cumulative production by private refineries during April, 2016 - February, 2017 was 83267.41 TMT which is 1.43% higher than the target for the period and 3.05% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year.


          3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of February, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April, 2016 - February, 2017 vis-à-vis April, 2015 - February, 2016 are given at Annexures-IV and V respectively.
