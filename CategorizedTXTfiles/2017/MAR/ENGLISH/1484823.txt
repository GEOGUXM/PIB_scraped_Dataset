      Posted On: 17 MAR 2017 6:21PM by PIB Delhi

      
      The Indian Air Force (IAF) is adequately equipped to cater for the threat environment that exists and is ready to meet the role assigned to it. Operational preparedness of IAF is reviewed from time to time based on the threat perception.
      
      The first indigenous Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) system on board Embraer-145 has been inducted into Indian Air Force on 14.02.2017, with Initial Operational Configuration capabilities.
      
      The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is developing three such systems at a cost of Rs.2425 crore.
      
      Augmentation of airborne surveillance capabilities of IAF by way of procurement and indigenous production depends upon national security, strategic objectives and operational requirements of the defence forces and is reviewed by the Government from time to time. This is dynamic and continuous process.
      
      This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri J Jayavardhan and others in Lok Sabha today.
