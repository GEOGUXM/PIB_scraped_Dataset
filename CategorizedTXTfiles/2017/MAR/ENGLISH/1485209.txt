      Posted On: 22 MAR 2017 5:38PM by PIB Delhi


      52 pairs of trains have been speeded up and converted into Superfast category. However, speeding up of trains is a continuous exercise over Indian Railways and is done keeping in view the operational feasibility, availability of sectional speed on line, high speed compatible coaches, high power locos etc. ‘Mission Raftaar’ has been announced in the Railway Budget 2016-17. The mission envisages, inter alia, increasing the average speed of all non-suburban passenger trains by 25 kmph in next 5 years. A cross functional Mobility Directorate has been created in Railway Board for this purpose.

      
      The fare of Superfast trains has not been increased. However, there is a levy of Supplementary charge for Superfast trains.
      
      This Press Release is based on the information given by the Minister of State for Railways Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha on 22.03.2017 (Wednesday).
