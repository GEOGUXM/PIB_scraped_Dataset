    As per available information, there are presently more than 25,000 active voluntary organisations including schools and madrasas who are receiving assistance from foreign countries. State wise data and information regarding unregistered voluntary organisations is not available with the Ministry.
    
    Zakir Naik’s NGO, ‘Islamic Research Foundation’ (IRF) has been proscribed under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for links to terrorism. There are no current direct inputs to indicate that any other FCRA-registered NGO, has come to notice for misuse of foreign contribution to spread terrorism.
    
    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question by Shri Sukhbir Singh Jaunapuria in the Lok Sabha today.
