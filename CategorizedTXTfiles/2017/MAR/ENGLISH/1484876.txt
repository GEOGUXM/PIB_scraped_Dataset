      Posted On: 17 MAR 2017 5:56PM by PIB Delhi


    Force accretion of Armed Forces and development of their combat capabilities to tackle the entire spectrum of security challenges is an ongoing process dictated primarily by capabilities to be achieved, threat perceptions, prevailing eternal strategic security environment and emerging technologies.

    Procurement of defence weapons/equipments and ammunition is undertaken as per the Long Term Integrated Perspective Plan (LTIPP), the 5 year Acquisition Plan, the Annual Acquisition Plan and the 12 th Defence Plan.

    Government has sanctioned a number of proposals for accretion of manpower in the recent years. A number of measures have also been taken to meet the shortage of manpowers in the Armed Forces including by sustained image projection, publicity campaign to create awareness among the youth on the advantages of taking up a challenging and satisfying career, as also by augmenting the training infrastructure of the Armed forces.

    The details of personnel in the defence services are as under:-
