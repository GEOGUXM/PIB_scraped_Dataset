      The Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa PVSM AVSM YSM VM ADC has formally launched the e-billing system 'ATF DIP' at New Delhi on 28 Mar 17. The new Digital Issue and Payment system will be implemented from 01 Apr 17.
      
      The Aviation Fuel Management in the Indian Air Force involves over two lakh transactions and a substantial portion of the Air Force revenue budget per year. The IAF has embarked upon an e-billing system in line with the Government of India's flagship programme of Digital India.
      
      A web based e-billing module christened as `ATF DIP' or the `Aviation Turbine Fuel Digital Issue and Payment' has been developed for the speedy accounting and clearance of Aviation Fuel bills of Oil PSUs.
      
      During the formal launch, the CAS highlighted that this was a milestone achievement for the IAF and complimented all stake holders, especially CGDA and Chairman of M/s IOCL for their whole hearted association with the IAF in completing the project within a short span of time.
      
      He also complimented the PSU for their commitment and unstinted support in ensuring robust supply chain management of Aviation Fuel, especially at the high altitude locations and during natural calamities. The Indian Oil Corporation was specially lauded for their initiative in developing new designs for Bulk Petroleum Installation and Rubberised Fuel Tanks for ATF supplies at Advance Landing Grounds (ALGs)/Helipads to support various contingencies.
