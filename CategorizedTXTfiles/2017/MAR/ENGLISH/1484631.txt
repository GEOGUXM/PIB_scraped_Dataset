    The share of nuclear power was about 3.2% in India in the year 2016-17 (up to Feb-2017). During this period, about 34136 Million Units (MUs) of electricity was produced from Nuclear Power Plants against a total of about 1052160 MUs produced in India [Source: Central Electricity Authority (CEA), All India Summary, Issue Date-March 02, 2017]. The share of nuclear power is country-specific and depends on other sources of electricity generation deployed in the country.
    
    The share of nuclear power in total electricity generation is planned to be progressively increased by addition of nuclear power capacity for which a large expansion programme based on both indigenous technologies and with foreign technical cooperation is planned. In this regard, the Government has taken several enabling steps which include according of “In principle” approval of sites for locating future nuclear reactors based both on indigenous technologies and with foreign technical cooperation; entering into enabling agreements with foreign countries for nuclear cooperation including supply of fuel; amendment of the Atomic Energy Act to enable Joint Ventures of Public Sector Companies to set up nuclear power projects and creation of India Nuclear Insurance Pool (INIP) for resolving issues arising out of Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act, 2010.
