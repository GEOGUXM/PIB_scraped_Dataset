2             To enhance the transparency and reduce human interface on-line software has been developed and put in use for filing of claims for the infrastructure development projects. This has also being expanded to other schemes.  On-line software has resulted in quicker disposal of the claims for grant by the projects and resulting in acceleration of the progress on the grant
