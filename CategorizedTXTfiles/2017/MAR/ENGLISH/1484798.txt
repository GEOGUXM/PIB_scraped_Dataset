      Posted On: 17 MAR 2017 5:39PM by PIB Delhi


    The Ministry of Corporate Affairs had setup the Central Registration Centre in 2016 for processing “Name Availability” and “Incorporation” applications for starting a new company. In cases where the applications are compliant with the Companies Act/Rules, the same are processed within the next 1-2 working days.
    
    The authenticity is ensured by obtaining a declaration and certification by a professional such as an advocate/ chartered accountant / cost accountant / company secretary in practice. In addition, the person named in the Articles of Association as a director/manager/secretary of the company has to give a declaration confirming the fulfilment of all requirements for registration under the Companies Act and Rules thereunder. Any false statement in this regard is punishable under section 448 of the Companies Act, 2013.
    
    This was stated by Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal, Minister of State for Corporate Affairs in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
