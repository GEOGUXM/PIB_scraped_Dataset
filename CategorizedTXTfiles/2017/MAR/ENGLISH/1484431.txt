The Minister said that the Government is determined to boost the manufacturing sector in the country by pursuing its global agenda on ‘Make in India’ campaign. The Labour laws are being reformed by bringing in more transparency through the application of information technology in the administration of these laws. This rationalization process will improve the working condition of workers as well as encourage the investors to invest in the country.
