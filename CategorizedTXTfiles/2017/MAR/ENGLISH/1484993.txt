    In order to bring premier educational institutions like IITs/NITs/ IISERs and IIITs into international knowledge network, Government has undertaken several initiatives such as:
    i. The Global Interactive Academic Network (GIAN), under which foreign academicians are invited to offer short courses in the Indian institutions.
    ii. Provision of 10% supernumerary seats for foreign students.
    iii. Promotion of collaborative research with foreign universities.
    iv. Conducting of entrance exams like JEE (Main) and JEE (Advanced) in select foreign countries.
    v. Besides this, the UGC (Promotion and Maintenance of Standards of Academic Collaboration between Indian and Foreign Educational Institutions) Regulations, 2016 allows Indian Universities to have collaboration with foreign universities with prior permission of UGC. The UGC regulations also permit private and deemed to be universities to establish off-shore campuses.
    In order to promote high quality research, (66) Centres of Excellence have been started in the Institutes of National Importance and Universities. Funds are also provided under RUSA for research, innovation and quality improvement programmes.
    For improving funds for quality research, initiatives such as Impacting Research Innovation and Technology (IMPRINT) and Uchhatar Avishkar Yojana (UAY) have been launched. Under these, research that is socially relevant, outcome-oriented and is of use to the Industry are funded. The total budget for the two schemes is Rs.487 crore and Rs.475 crore respectively.

    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey today in a written reply to a Lok Sabha question.
