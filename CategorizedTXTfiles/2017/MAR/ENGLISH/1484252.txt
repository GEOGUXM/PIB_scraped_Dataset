      I express my heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families of the personnel who have lost their lives and I would like to say firmly that the entire nation is with them in their hour of grief. The nation will always remember their sacrifices. The injured personnel will be provided with the best possible treatment available. On behalf of the entire house, I pray for their health and wellbeing.
      The unprecedented success of the Security Forces of late has led to evident uneasiness among the Left Wing Extremist Groups. The Forces have achieved tremendous success during 2016 in all LWE affected States and particularly in Chhattisgarh where 135 LWE cadres were eliminated, 779 arrested and 1198 surrendered. The number of violent incidents in Chhattisgarh also dropped by 15% from 466 in 2015 to 395 in 2016. Improved efficacy of the Security Forces is evident from the following indicators-
      (a) The number of Left Wing Extremists killed increased by 150% (89 in 2015 to 222 in 2016) in 2016.
      (b) Surrenders and arrests registered a combined increase of 47% over 2015 (2238 to 3282).
      (c) Only 03 weapons were lost by the SFs in 2016 as against 15 in 2015.
      (d) 67% of Encounters/Exchange of Fire resulted in neutralization of LWE cadres as against only 36% in 2015.
      (e) Sustained operations by the Security Forces ensured that South Bastar districts, considered to be the nucleus of LWE strength witnessed a considerable fall in violence in 2016 (252 incidents as against 326 in 2015).
      The Left Wing Extremists have suffered unprecedented losses in 2016. They have admitted so, openly in their documents and statements. They will continue to attempt such incidents to restore the flagging morale of their cadres. I believe that our brave soldiers and officers will continue to respond with a firm resolve and contribute whole heartedly towards elimination of Left Wing Extremism.
      However there is a need for introspection on this incident. I have directed the DG, CRPF to conduct a detailed enquiry into the incident so that the lapses that led to the incident can be identified which will reduce the possibility of repetition of such incidents in the future.
      I visited Chhattisgarh to pay my homage to the martyrs and met the two injured personnel on the day of the incident itself. Arrangements were made to ensure that mortal remains reach their respective families. Loss of life can in no way be compensated by money, however, the next of kin of the martyred CRPF personnel will be provided Rs 35 lacs as ex-gratia from the Central Government, Rs 20 lacs from the Risk Fund of CRPF and Rs 01 lac from the CRPF Welfare Fund. They will also get Rs 25 lacs as insurance benefits and Rs 03 lacs as ex-gratia from the Chhattisgarh Government. The next of kin will also be provided full salary till the age of superannuation of the personnel martyred under the Liberalized Pensionary Award (LPA).
      I assure the house that the Government is committed to providing all support to the CAPF in order to prepare them for their tasks. In the same way the Government is also committed to supporting the States for training, capacity building, provision of CAPF battalions as required and intelligence sharing.
      I would like to assure the nation through this house that we will not let Left Wing Extremists succeed in misleading the people and depriving parts of the country from the benefits of development.
      I once again pay my homage to the martyred personnel and express heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families. I assure the house that their sacrifices will not go in vain.”
