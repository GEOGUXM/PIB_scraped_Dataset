    The target of construction of National Highways is 15,000 km, of which 6,604 km have been completed till Feb in the current financial year 2016-17. The slow speed of construction of National Highways(NHs) are mainly due to land acquisition, utility shifting, non-availability of Soil/Aggregates, Poor performance of contractors, Environment/ Forest/Wildlife Clearance, ROB & RUB issue with Railways, Public agitation for additional facilities, Arbitration/contractual disputes with contractors etc. There is a well-established mechanism for monitoring and testing of quality of construction and development of work of National Highways (NHs) by engaging a Consultancy firm of International and National repute for every project to ensure quality construction. They supervise, monitor and conduct tests as per procedures laid down in various codes published by Indian Road Congress, manuals & MoRT&H specifications for Road and Bridge works and National Highway Authority India Quality Manuals etc. Apart from this, field units and Quality Division of Ministry, NHAI and State PWD also conduct inspection at various project sites regularly to monitor the quality of work. Quality Auditors are also engaged from time to time for conducting Quality Audits of the project work. On observation of any violation, action against the defaulter is taken as per provision in the agreement. The Ministry has empaneled National Level Project Monitors for monitoring of critical and languishing National Highways projects all over the country. This information was given by the Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways Shri Pon. Radhakrishnan in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today. ***** UM/NP/MS
