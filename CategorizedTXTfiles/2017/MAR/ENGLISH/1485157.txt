      Posted On: 22 MAR 2017 3:32PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government continues to engage pro-actively with SAARC countries to strengthen trade and economic relations. Issues impacting bilateral trade, raised by these countries, are taken up for an early resolution. Discussions are held with these countries at bilateral/multilateral level from time to time, to explore mechanisms for enhancement of cross border trade.
    
    Government has set up Border Haats at India-Bangladesh border to promote well-being of the people dwelling in remote areas by establishing traditional system of marketing the local produce through local markets. Issues relating to improvement of trade infrastructure at Land Custom Stations/Integrated Check Posts are also being coordinated in consultation with the concerned states and the neighbouring countries.
    
    Further, assistance is provided under Market Access Initiative(MAI) and Market Development Assistance(MDA) schemes to Indian exporters, Export Promotion Councils, Apex Trade Bodies etc. for participation in events in foreign countries, including countries in neighbourhood.
    
    This information was given by the Commerce and Industry Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
