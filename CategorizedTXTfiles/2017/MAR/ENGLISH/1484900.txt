    The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee has extended his greetings and felicitations to the Government and people of the Republic of Tunisia on the eve of their National Day (March 20, 2017).
    
    In a message to His Excellency Mr. Beji Caid Essebsi, the President of the Republic of Tunisia, the President has said, “On behalf of the Government, the people of India and on my own behalf, it is with immense pleasure that I extend warm greetings and felicitations to you and to the friendly people of the Republic of Tunisia on the occasion of your National Day.
    
    Our two countries enjoy a close and multi-faceted relationship. The fruitful visit of Vice President Mr. Mohammad Hamid Ansari to Tunisia in June 2016 has laid the foundation for a deeper and diversified relationship between our nations.
