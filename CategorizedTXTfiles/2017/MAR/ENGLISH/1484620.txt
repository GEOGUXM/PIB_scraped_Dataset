      Posted On: 16 MAR 2017 4:36PM by PIB Delhi


    As per Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S), Kolkata, the share of the air transport in the total exports of the country in terms of value for the last three years are as under:

    Year % Share of Air Transport;

    in the total exports;

    2013-14 19.76
    2014-15 21.87
    2015-16 23.49

    As per DGCI&S, different commodities being exported have different units of measurement, viz kilograms, square meters, numbers, carats etc. hence calculation of volume of exports in a single unit is very difficult and will not give an accurate figure.

    This information was given by the Minister of State for Civil Aviation Shri Jayant Sinha in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
