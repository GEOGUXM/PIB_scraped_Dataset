    Duel Benefit of Government Schemes for both Employers and Employees


    March 31, 2017


    The Government of India has launched Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojnca (PMPRY) and Pradhan Mantri Paridhan Rojgar Protsahan Vojna (PMPRPV) both on August 9, 2016.


    The scheme PMPRY will incentivize employers for generation of new employment. Government of India shall be paying the Employees' Pension Scheme contribution of 8.33 per cent for all new employees enrolling in EPFO for the first three years for their employment under this scheme. It has a dual benefit, where, on one hand, the employer is incentivized for increasing the employment of workers in the establishment, and on the other hand, a large number of workers will find jobs in such establishments. A direct benefit is that these workers will have access to social security benefits of the organized sector.


    Under the PMPRPY scheme in case of textile sector, the government will also be paying the 3.67 per cent EPF contribution of the eligible employers for the new employees along with Employeesâ€™ Pension Scheme contribution of 8.33 per cent.


    Knowing the benefits of these schemes, the employers can create job opportunities for the workforce. The employees whose Aadhaar is seeded along with approved KYC are eligible for benefit.
