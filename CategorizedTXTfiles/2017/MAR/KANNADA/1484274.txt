      The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has appealed to the citizens to take the pledge for a New India and express commitment.
      
      The Prime Minister said, " On the NM Mobile App http://nm4.in/dnldapp , take the pledge and express your commitment towards building a new India.
      
      A new India is emerging, which is being powered by the strength & skills of 125 crore Indians. This India stands for development.
      
      When we mark 75 years of freedom in 2022, we should have made an India that will make Gandhi Ji, Sardar Patel & Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar proud."
