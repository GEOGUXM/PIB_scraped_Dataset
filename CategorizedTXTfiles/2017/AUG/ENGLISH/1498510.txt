    The Central Government had constituted a Group of Experts (GoE) headed by late Prof. Ranjit Roy Choudhary to study the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 and make recommendations to the Government to make the Medical Council of India (MCI) modern and suited to the prevailing conditions. The report of GoE was subsequently examined by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health & Family Welfare and they too made their recommendations. Further, a four member committee headed by Vice Chairman NITI Aayog was constituted to examine all options for reforms in MCI and suggest way forward. The Committee has framed a draft “National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill” which provides for constitution of NMC in place of MCI. The draft Bill has been relooked by a Group of Ministers (GoM) constituted for the purpose. The GoM has approved the draft Bill with some modifications. The proposed National Medical Commission shall have an Appellate Tribunal and four boards viz. Under-Graduate medical Education Board (UGMEB), Post-Graduate Medical Education Board (PGMED), Medical Assessment and Rating Board (MARB) and Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB).


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
