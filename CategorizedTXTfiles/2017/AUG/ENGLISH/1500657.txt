    Rt. Honourable Mr. Sher Bahadur Deuba, the Prime Minister of Nepal, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (August 24, 2017).
    
    Welcoming the Nepalese Prime Minister, the President congratulated him on becoming the Prime Minister of Nepal for the 4th time. He expressed happiness that the Prime Minister of Nepal is the first foreign dignitary to stay in Rashtrapati Bhavan during his Presidency, and thanked Mr. Deuba for accepting his invitation.
    
    The President congratulated the Government and people of Nepal for successfully conducting two phases of local elections. He also conveyed his best wishes for the conduct of the upcoming provincial and federal elections in Nepal.
    
    The President of India condoled the loss of lives and destruction of property during recent floods in Nepal. He said the Government and people of India were committed to stand by Nepal.
    
    The President expressed satisfaction on the state of India-Nepal relations which have seen eight high level visits in the past three years. He said that India-Nepal relations derive their strength from a shared history, common culture, trade links and an open border. This is symbolised by the “national” treatment both countries give to each other’s citizens. India is looking forward to expanding its economic and development cooperation with Nepal, as per Nepal’s national priorities.
    
    The President expressed happiness at the large number of Nepalese students studying in India. He emphasised that the Government of India provides several scholarships to Nepalese students, and they are always welcome in India.
