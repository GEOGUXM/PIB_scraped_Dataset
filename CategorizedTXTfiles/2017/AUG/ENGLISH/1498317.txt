    Govt. of India has taken up the Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP) with the financial assistance of the World Bank for the repair and rehabilitation of initially about 225 dam projects across the seven states of India, namely Jharkhand (DVC), Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and Uttarakhand (UJVNL). The number of dams has been finally revised to 198. Project was started in April 2012 and scheduled completion is June 2018. The total project cost is Rs.2100 Crore.


    The objectives of DRIP are to improve the safety and operational performance of selected existing dams and associated appurtenances in a sustainable manner, and to strengthen the dam safety institutional setup of participating States / Implementing Agencies.


    The State-wise breakup of the dams identified for rehabilitation along with fund allocated to Project Implementing Agencies under DRIP is given as under:-
