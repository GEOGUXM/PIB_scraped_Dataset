      A five year (2015-2020) Long Term Roll on Works plan (LTRoWP) for BRO has been approved for construction/improvement of 530 roads as identified by the Army. Work is in progress on 373 roads and for 157 roads work is in pre-construction stage. Out of the 373 roads, 17 roads are delayed which were to be completed by 2016 as per the LTRoWP. The revised completion schedule for the 17 roads is as under:-


      · 8 roads by 2017


      · 8 roads by 2018


      · 1 road by 2020


      The 17 roads which are delayed are being executed by BRO through departmental execution and the work is in progress therefore, the additional expenditure, if any, can be ascertained once these roads are completed.


      This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Prof. MV Rajeev Gowda in Rajya Sabha today.
