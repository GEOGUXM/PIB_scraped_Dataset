      Posted On: 01 AUG 2017 5:47PM by PIB Delhi


    Development and Modernisation of airports is a continuous process which is undertaken by Airports Authority of India (AAI) from time to time depending upon traffic demand, availability of land and resources, grant of environmental clearance, NOC's from various regulatory authorities, etc.
    
    In the bid to develop airports in the state of Tamil Nadu, especially in small cities, AAI has undertaken various modernization and upgradation works such as construction of new domestic terminal building to handle 470 peak hour passengers and conversion of old terminal building to international cargo terminal at Tiruchirappalli Airport, re-carpeting of existing runway/taxiway at Tuticorin Airport, construction of new integrated terminal building to cater to 700 peak hour passengers and conversion of part of old domestic terminal building as common user domestic cargo terminal at Madurai Airport and extension and modification of old integrated terminal building to cater to 625 peak hour passengers at Coimbatore Airport. This information was given by Minister of State for Civil Aviation Shri Jayant Sinha in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
