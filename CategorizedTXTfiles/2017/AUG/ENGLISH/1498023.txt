      CRPFâ€™S Helpline in J&K
      Posted On: 01 AUG 2017 5:38PM by PIB Delhi


    The CRPF Helpline was launched in Jammu and Kashmir on 16.06.2017. The helpline is getting good response with callers seeking help in matters relating to medical assistance, misbehavior by anti-socials, recruitment details and complaints about unavailability of civic amenities. They also seek assistance in organizing sports events and improving sports facilities especially in rural areas.


    The Helpline has been started to build bridge of trust and confidence with citizens.


    It is true that some calls are silent. It is difficult to attribute a particular reason though it may possibly be that citizens are trying to confirm about the existence of toll free helpline.


    CRPF has undertaken Publicity Campaigns through print, electronics, social media and audio-visual media also to reach out to every Kashmiri and for increasing the awareness about CRPF Helpline among local public.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question by Dr. P Venugopal in the Lok Sabha today.
