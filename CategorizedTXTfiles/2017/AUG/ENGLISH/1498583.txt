    Improvement to Passenger amenities on Indian Railways (IR) is a continuous process. Present day passengers expect visible and qualitative improvement in public utilities and amenities provided at the Stations. With a view to meeting the expectations of the passengers, Indian Railways is making all out effort to provide improved facilities at the stations including those located in small cities/towns. Indian Railways has more than 8000 Stations. It has always been the endeavour of the Railways to provide adequate amenities to the passengers at the stations. Certain amenities are provided at the time of construction of new stations based on anticipated volume of traffic. Amenities are further augmented from time to time with growth in passenger traffic handled at stations, based on the felt need, expectations of the travelling public and availability of funds.


    In the recent past Indian Railways has taken various steps to improve the services and facilitate the passengers, some of which are given below.


    At stations:

     1. Lifts and Escalators at the stations for facilitating movement across platforms.
     2. Battery Operated Vehicles for carrying passengers before/after the train journey, especially senior citizens and persons with disabilities.
      * Yatri Mitra Sewa for passengers requiring wheel-chair assistance.
     1. Well appointed Retiring Rooms, Waiting Halls and Executive Lounges to relax for passengers during transit.
     2. Wi-fi facility at 127 important stations on IR.

    In Reservations and travel:

     1. Introduction of the Alternate Train Accommodation Scheme known as ‘VIKALP’ to give option to waitlisted passengers to shift to alternate train having vacant accommodation.
     2. Provision of facility to physically handicapped persons to book reserved tickets online.

In order to facilitate cancellation of PRS counter tickets at relatively smaller stations, one of the Unreserved Ticketing System(UTS) cum PRS counters (wherever PRS booking facility is available) has been earmarked for granting refund beyond the working hours of PRS counters/Current counters. This facility is available in respect of PRS counter tickets for those trains whose scheduled departure time is within the next 24 hours.
