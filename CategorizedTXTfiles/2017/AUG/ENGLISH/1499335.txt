    The expenditure on the exercises is either part of the regular overseas deployment programme of Indian Naval Ships or is met from the revenue budget of the Indian Navy.


    There is no institutionalized joint exercise with China. However, a Passage Exercise (PASSEX) was conducted with the PLA Navy during an Indian Navy Shipâ€™s visit to Qingdao, China in April 2014.
