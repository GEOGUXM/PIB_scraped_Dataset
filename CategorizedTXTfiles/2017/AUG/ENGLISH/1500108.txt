        The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind met the President’s Press Wing officers and staff at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (August 19, 2017). This is the second in a series of meetings that the President of India has called to acquaint himself with the President’s staff. In the first batch, he had met the President’s Military Wing officers and staff at Rashtrapati Bhavan on August 5, 2017.
        The Press Secretary to the President, Shri Ashok Malik introduced the Press Wing of Rashtrapati Bhavan to the President, comprising Deputy Press Secretary, Smt. Shamima Siddiqui, Message Section, Library, Photo Section, Multi Media Studio, Reference & Clipping Cell and the Government of India Printing Press.
        Speaking on the occasion, the President said Rashtrapati Bhavan is a national institution. It belongs to all the people of our country. The Press Wing is responsible for providing information regarding Rashtrapati Bhavan to the world. Rashtrapati Bhavan should be accessible to as many people as possible. Those in Delhi can visit it by themselves, but an updated website and digital presence, in this era of digital technology and social media, can ensure that more and more people in other parts of the country can be part of the Rashtrapati Bhavan online community. He also emphasized the importance of physical health and good conduct of officers and staff of Rashtrapati Bhavan.
