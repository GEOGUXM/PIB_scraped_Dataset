    Further, Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment implements the Central Sector Scheme of Assistance for Prevention of Alcoholism and Substance (Drug) Abuse and for Social Defence Services for identification, counseling, treatment and rehabilitation of addicts through voluntary and other eligible organizations. Underthis Scheme, financial assistance upto 90% of the expenditure is provided to Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), Panchayati Raj Institutions, Urban Local Bodies etc. for inter-alia, awareness & preventive education and running of Integrated Rehabilitation Centres for Addicts (IRCAs). In the case of North-Eastern States, Sikkim and Jammu & Kashmir, the quantum of assistance is 95% of the total admissible expenditure.
