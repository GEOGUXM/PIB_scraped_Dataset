      Posted On: 08 AUG 2017 12:05PM by PIB Delhi


    Since Industry is a State subject, the Department of Heavy Industry (DHI) does not maintain any centralized data regarding generation of new employment and investment made in heavy industries in the country. The role of DHI is confined to the administration of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) under its administrative control. So far as details of employment and investment in CPSEs, in the country, is concerned, the Public Enterprises Survey 2015 – 16, already laid in both the houses of Parliament on 21st March, 2017 indicates that the total number of employees in CPSEs is declining every year since 2009 – 10 except during 2011 -12 and the investment in these CPSEs during the last 3 years i.e. 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16 was Rs. 992095.67 cr., 1095554.32 cr. and 1171844.25 cr. respectively.


    This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Lok Sabha today.
