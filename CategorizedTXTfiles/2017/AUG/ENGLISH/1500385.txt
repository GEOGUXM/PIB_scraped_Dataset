    The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh is leading a delegation today to the Kyrgyz Republic to attend the 9th Meeting of Heads of Governments of Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Member states to be held on August 24-25, 2017, dealing with the prevention and elimination of emergency situations. The Indian delegation includes senior officers from the Ministry of Home Affairs, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the Ministry of External Affairs.


    India got the full membership of SCO this year and the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi attended Shanghai Cooperation Organizationâ€™s annual Summit meeting held in Astana, Kazakhstan in June, 2017. The participation of India as SCO Member will open the additional opportunities for giving new impetus to the development of international cooperation in the field of protecting the population and territories from emergency situations within the framework of the SCO and will bring it qualitatively new positions in regional and global formats.


    Meeting of Heads of Government authorities of Shanghai Cooperation Organization Member states will consider and approve the draft Action Plan for 2018-2019 for the implementation of the agreement between the governments of the SCO Member States on cooperation in providing assistance in the elimination of emergency situations.


    During the visit, the Home Minister is likely to have bilateral meetings with the Ministers of some of the SCO Member States.
