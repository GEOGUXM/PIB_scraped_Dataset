    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated, and laid the foundation stone, of several major highway projects at Udaipur in Rajasthan.


    Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said he is delighted to be in the "Veer Bhumi" of Mewar.


    The Prime Minister assured people affected by natural calamities, that the Union Government stood by them at this hour of difficulty, and expressed confidence that the people would overcome the challenges, and march forward with even greater vigour.


    The Prime Minister said that projects worth over 15000 crore are either being Inaugurated, or initiated (foundation stone being laid) today, in a single function.


    The Prime Minister said that infrastructure projects are crucial to the progress of the country. He said India can no longer afford delay in infrastructure projects, especially connectivity projects. He said projects such as roads, infuse new energy in the lives of the people.


    The Prime Minister recalled the Golden Quadrilateral initiated by former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and said it benefited farmers by connecting them to markets. He said Rajasthan could benefit a lot from tourism, through better infrastructure connectivity, which would bring in employment.


    The Prime Minister spoke about the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, under which LPG connections are being given to rural households, which will especially benefit women.


    The Prime Minister said GST had hugely benefited the nation's economy, by eliminating long waiting times at inter-state borders.


    The Prime Minister later visited the Pratap Gaurav Kendra, which celebrates the life, valour and achievements of Maharana Pratap, the great King of the erstwhile kingdom of Mewar.
