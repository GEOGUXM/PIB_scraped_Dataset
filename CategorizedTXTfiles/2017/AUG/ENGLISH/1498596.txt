    Under National AYUSH Mission (NAM) grant-in-aid is being provided to State/UT Governments as per their proposed State Annual Action Plans (SAAPs). Since, implementation of the programme comes under the purview of State/UT Governments, no target has been fixed by the Central Government State/UT wise. However, resource pool allocated under NAM for each State/UT Government is communicated to the States/UTs. Accordingly, States/UTs are required to prepare their State Annual Action Plans (SAAPs) as per their requirements in accordance with NAM guidelines.


    The Government of India approved and notified National AYUSH Mission (NAM) on 29 th September 2014 which envisages better access to AYUSH services, strengthening of AYUSH educational institutions, facilitate the enforcement of quality control of Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani & Homoeopathy (ASU &H) drugs and sustainable availability of ASU & H raw-materials in the States/UTs during 12th Plan.
