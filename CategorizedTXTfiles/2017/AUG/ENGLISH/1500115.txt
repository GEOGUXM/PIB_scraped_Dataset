        The DPR of Damanganga -Pinjal link and Par-Tapi-Narmada interlinking projects are in advanced stage. Further, the Kosi â€“Mechi link and Kosi-Ghagra link envisaged in the Himalayan region would greatly attenuate high flood intensity in the Ganga Basin.

Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project on river Sarada; Sapta Kosi High dam Project and Sun Kosi Storage-cum- Diversion scheme are proposed in the Sapta Kosi Basin.
