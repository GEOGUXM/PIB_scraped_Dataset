    The coastal security issues are regularly reviewed at appropriate levels with National committee on Strengthening Maritime and Coastal Security (NCSMCS), being the apex body for inter-ministerial and inter-agency coordination. A coastal security mechanism in the form of a three-tiered cover comprising Indian Navy (IN), Indian Coast Guard (ICG) and State Marine Police with demarcated areas of responsibility has been put in place. Coastal Security Exercises are being conducted in all coastal States and Union Territories to assess the effectiveness of existing mechanisms and to address gaps.

    
    Coastal Surveillance Network (CSN) which includes radars has been established along the coastline. Under Phase-I of this project 45 radars have been made operational. Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard have been provided with adequate powers under the Coast Guard Act, 1978 and other Acts / Rules to enable them to face various challenges effectively.
    
    This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Smt Rajani Patil in Rajya Sabha today.
