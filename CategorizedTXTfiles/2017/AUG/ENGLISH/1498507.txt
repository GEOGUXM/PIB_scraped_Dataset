      Posted On: 04 AUG 2017 1:10PM by PIB Delhi


    Central Government provides assistance to the States for strengthening of health infrastructure under the National Health Mission. This facilitates treatment for various diseases and emergencies including snake bites. Health being a State subject, the Ministry has asked the States to procure anti-snake venom serum under National Health Mission after reflecting the same in their annual PIP for approvals.


    Rabies is transmitted to the humans following bite of animals (dogs, cats, monkeys, mongoose etc.) infected by rabies virus. For prevention of deaths due to Rabies, Government of India is implementing the National Rabies Control Programme in the country. The objectives of the program are to:


    · Prevent human deaths due to rabies


    · Prevent transmission of rabies virus in dog population


    · Mass vaccination of dogs.


    · Dog population management


    · Strengthening surveillance & response.


    To prevent deaths due to human rabies, the strategy adopted is to implement more cost effective Intra Dermal (ID) route of inoculation for anti-rabies vaccines for Category II & Category III bites and infiltration of Rabies immunoglobulin in all Cat III bites in all major anti-rabies clinics of government health facilities.


    The States are asked to organize training of health professional on animal bite management and ID route of anti-rabies vaccination, IEC activities for community awareness on dos’ and don’ts in the eventof animal bite, strengthening surveillance of human rabies and strengthening lab diagnostics for rabies.


    As per reports received from the States, details of State wise deaths due to snake bite and rabies, during the last three years in the country are given below:
