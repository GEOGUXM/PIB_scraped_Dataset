        The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind has greeted fellow-citizens on the eve of Ganesh Chaturthi.


        In his message, the President has said, "On the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi, I convey my heartiest greetings and good wishes to my fellow citizens.


        Lord Ganesha, widely worshipped as the God of wisdom, prosperity and good fortune, is traditionally invoked at the beginning of new ventures. The great freedom fighter, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak championed the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi to garner support for our country’s freedom movement. Let us on this day recall this inclusive vision and re-dedicate ourselves to building a strong and caring India where peace and prosperity prevail.


        May the celebrations of the birth of Lord Ganesha remove all obstacles in India’s path of progress and bless us all with joy, prosperity and peace”.


        Hindi version of the President’s message is attached.
