    Ø Amendment to the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 by which eligibility limit for payment of bonus enhanced from Rs 10,000/- to Rs. 21,000/- per month and the Calculation Ceiling from Rs. 3,500/- to Rs. 7,000/- or the minimum wages.

    Ø Maternity Benefit Amendment Act, 2017, increases the paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks.


    Ø The Employee Compensation (Amendment) Act, seeks to rationalize penalties and strengthen the rights of the workers under the Act.

The said Bill inter alia provides for freedom to operate an Establishment for 365 days in a year without any restriction on opening/closing time and enables employment of women during night shifts if adequate safety provisions exist.


    Ø A category i.e. Fixed Term Employment has been introduced under Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946 to impart flexibility to an establishment to employ people in case of Apparel Manufacturing Sector to meet the fluctuating demands of the sector due to its seasonal nature .


    These legislative initiatives are expected to not only facilitate effective enforcement but also enhance wage security, job security, social security and safety, health and working conditions for workers.
