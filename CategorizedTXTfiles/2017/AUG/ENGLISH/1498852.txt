        Law and order is a State subject. No information is available centrally on the expenditure incurred on keeping such people in custody.


        Central Government is vested with powers to deport a foreign national illegally staying in t he country under Section 3(2)(c ) of the Foreigners Act, 1946. These powers to identify, detect a nd deport illegally staying foreign nationals have also been delegated to the State Govts/UT Administrations. Detection and deportation of such over-staying foreign nationals is a continuous process. In genuine cases, where the overstay is unintentional or because of ignorance or under compelling circumstances, the period of overstay is regularized and visa extension fee is charged for the overstay period. Where the overstay is found to be intentional, the foreigner is served with Leave India Notice and penalty/ visa fee for the period of overstay is charged as per instructions.


        This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question by Shri Vishnu Dayal Ram, Shri Bharat Singh and Shri Rakesh Singh in the Lok Sabha today.
