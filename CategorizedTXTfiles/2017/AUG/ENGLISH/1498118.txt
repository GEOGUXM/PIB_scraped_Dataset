      Posted On: 02 AUG 2017 3:21PM by PIB Delhi


    As on 30.06.2017, 1962 complaints alleging various misconducts are under enquiry relating to public servants under the jurisdiction of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC). Investigation into complaints is an ongoing process and the Commission regularly monitors the pendency with the Chief Vigilance Officers to ensure time-bound completion of the same. The delays are on account of multitude of reasons such as lack of adequate officers in certain offices, complexity of investigations, time taken to follow the laid down procedure, non-cooperation of the suspect officers etc.


    In terms of Section 8(2) read with 8(1)(d) of CVC Act, 2003, the Commission can inquire or cause an inquiry or investigation to be made into any complaint against certain categories of officials specified wherein it is alleged that the official has committed offences under Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. Generally, complaints containing specific allegations of corruption / vigilance overtone are referred by the Commission to the Chief Vigilance Officers of the administrative Ministries / Departments concerned for Inquiry & Report. In an exceptional case, the Commission orders direct inquiry by a team of officers.


    The inquiries into various complaints are being pursued as per the laid down procedures and rules.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions and Minister of State for Prime Ministerâ€™s Office, Dr Jitendra Singh in a written reply to question by Shri Vijay Kumar Hansdak in the Lok Sabha today.
