    Central Water Commission (CWC) under Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (MoWR, RD & GR) carries out techno-economic appraisal of major and medium irrigation projects (Command Area more than 2000 hectare) which are planned on Inter-State river / river basins. 15 projects of Chhattisgarh have been approved and accepted by Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) of MoWR, RD & GR.


    As per the complaint of Odisha dated 19.11.2016 under Section 3 of the Inter State River Water Dispute (ISRWD) Act, 1956, the utilization of water to the extent of 33.89 BCM by Chhattisgarh is for the purposes of existing, ongoing and future irrigation, industrial use and domestic projects of Chhattisgarh. In its complaint dated 19.11.2016 submitted to the Central Government under Section 3 of the ISRWD Act, 1956, the Government of Odisha raised the issues like quantum of minimum flow in Hirakud dam, surplus flow and shares of States in minimum and surplus flows.


    The Central Government in accordance with Sec 4(1) of ISRWD Act, 1956 set up a Negotiation Committee on 19.01.2017, which comprised of members from basin States and concerned Ministries of Central Government, Central Water Commission, India Meteorological Department and National Institute of Hydrology for finding a negotiated settlement of the water dispute. The Committee submitted its report to MoWR, RD & GR on 27.6.2017.


    In accordance with the provisions of the ISRWD Act, 1956, the Central Government is required to refer the matter to a Tribunal for adjudication within a year from the date of receipt of reference if it is of the opinion that the water dispute cannot be settled by negotiations. Therefore, issues raised in the complaint dated 19.11.2016 of State of Odisha are subject to the outcome of the adjudication process.


    Govt. of Odisha has also filed Original Suit No.1/2017 in Hon'ble Supreme Court. Govt. of Odisha prayed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court for restraining Govt. of Chhattisgarh from continuing construction and operation of six industrial Barrages and taking up any project from the category of future project. Govt. of Odisha also prayed for constitution of Tribunal for resolution of Mahanadi water dispute. The case was last heard on 25.07.2017 and is pending. Hence, the matter is subjudice in the Court.


    This information was given by Union Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Balyan in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
