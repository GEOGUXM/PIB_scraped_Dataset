      Government of India has set up a dedicated fund called Nirbhaya Fund for implementation of initiatives aimed at enhancing the safety and security of women in the country. As per the guidelines of Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Women and Child Development is the nodal authority for appraisal of the schemes/proposals received under Nirbhaya Fund. Also, Ministry of Finance has set up an Empowered Committee under the Chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development for appraising and approving various schemes/project proposals proposed to be funded from the Nirbhaya Fund. The concerned Ministries take up the sanction and implementation of the schemes/proposals so appraised as they do for their other schemes/projects.

      Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing three schemes under Nirbhaya Fund, namely, One Stop Centre (OSC), Women Helpline(WHL) and Mahila Police Volunteer. One Stop Centres have been set up to facilitate access to an integrated range of services including medical, legal, and psychological support to women affected by violence to be funded through Nirbhaya Fund. The One Stop Centres will be integrated with 181 and other existing helplines. So far, 151 One Stop Centres have become operational. The Scheme of Universalisation of Women Helpline is intended to provide 24 hours immediate and emergency response to women affected by violence through referral and information about women related government schemes programs across the country through a single uniform number. The MWCD in collaboration with MHA has envisaged engagement of Mahila Police Volunteers in State/UTs who will act as a link between Police and Community and facilitate women in distress.


      The Empowered Committee of Officers, under the chairmanship of Secretary, WCD, which is an inter-ministerial committee appraises and recommends various proposals/projects proposed by different Ministries/Departments/States. The concerned Ministries then take up the sanction and implementation of the schemes/proposals so appraised as they do for their other schemes/projects. This Committee regularly reviews the implementation of the projects and try to ensure judicious utilization of funds from time to time with the concerned Ministries. Furthermore, the Ministries and State Governments have been requested on 10 th April, 2017 and reminded on 1 st August, 2017 to send innovative proposals that can enhance the security and safety of women.
