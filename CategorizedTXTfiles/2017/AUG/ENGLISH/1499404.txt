    The Food Safety and Standards (FSS) Act, 2006 has come into effect from 5 th August, 2011. The Prevention of Food Adulteration (PFA) Rules, 1955 stood repealed with commencement of theFSS Act. FSSAI takes up the issue of effective implementation and enforcement of the provisions of FSS Act, Rules and regulations thereunder with the State authorities through intermittent communications and interactions during the meetings of the Central Advisory Committee in which Commissioners of Food Safety of all States and UTs are represented. Regular surveillance, monitoring, inspection and random sampling of food products , including soft/cold drinks, are undertaken by the officials of Food Safety Departments of the respective States/ UTs to check that they comply with the standards laid down under FSS Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. In cases, where the food samples are found to be non-conforming, recourse is taken to penal provisions under Chapter IX of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
