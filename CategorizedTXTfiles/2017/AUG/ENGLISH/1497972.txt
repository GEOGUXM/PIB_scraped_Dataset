    In order to remove the difficulty faced by persons belonging to Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), who have migrated from one State/ Union Territory (UT) to another, in obtaining caste certificate from the State/ UT to which they have migrated, it had been clarified to all State Governments and UT Administrations, vide Ministry of Home Affairs letters dated 18.11.1982 and 06.08.1984, that the prescribed authority of a State Government/ UT Administration may issue the SC/ ST certificate to a person who has migrated from another State/UT, on the production of a genuine certificate issued to his father/ mother by the prescribed authority of the State/ UT of the father’s/mother’s origin, except where the prescribed authority feels that detailed enquiry is necessary through the State of origin before issue of the certificate. The certificate will be issued irrespective of whether the caste in question is scheduled or not in relation to the State/UT to which the person has migrated.


    For OBCs similar instructions were issued to States and UTs in Ministry of Welfare’s letter dated 08.04.1994.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Vijay Sampla in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
