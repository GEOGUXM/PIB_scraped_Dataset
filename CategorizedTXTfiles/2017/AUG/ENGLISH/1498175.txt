      Posted On: 02 AUG 2017 5:25PM by PIB Delhi


    The Second National Commission on Labour has recommended that the existing Labour Laws should be broadly grouped into four or five Labour Codes on functional basis. Accordingly, the Ministry has taken steps for drafting four Labour Codes on Wages; Industrial Relations; Social Security & Welfare; and Safety and Working Conditions respectively, by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing the relevant provisions of the existing Central Labour Laws. Ministry of Labour and Employment has prepared a preliminary draft on Labour Code on Social Security 2017 by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing the relevant provisions of the 15 existing Central Labour Laws and placed on the website of the Ministry on 16.3.2017, inviting comments of the public/stakeholders. The provisions of the Code on Social Security 2017 are under consideration.
    
    This information was given by Shri Bandaru Dattatreya, the Minister of State (IC) for Labour and Employment, in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha, today.
