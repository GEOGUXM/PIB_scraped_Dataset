    Three hundred ninety seven National Highways, projects amounting to Rs. 1,29,704 Crore, and having length of 14974 km are ongoing in Jammu & Kashmir, Haryana, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chandigarh and Delhi, connecting districts and major cities.

    
    There have been delays in some of these projects mainly due to problems in land acquisition, utility shifting, non-availability of soil or aggregates, poor performance of contractors, environment, forest or wildlife clearance, ROB & RUB issue with Railways, public agitation for additional facilities, arbitration/contractual disputes with contractors etc. In this regard, regular meetings are held with project developers, State Governments and contractors in headquarter as well as in Regional Office. To expedite completion of these projects various steps are also taken which include streamlining of land acquisition & environment clearances, exit for equity investors, premium re-schedulement, close coordination with other Ministries, revamping of dispute resolution mechanism, frequent reviews at various levels etc.
    
    This information was given by Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways and Shipping Shri Pon. Radhakrishnan in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
