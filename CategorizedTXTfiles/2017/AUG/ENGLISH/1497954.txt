    Senior Citizen Health Insurance Scheme (SCHIS) is also implemented w.e.f. 01.04.2016. Under this, health coverage is available for Rs.30,000/- per annum per senior citizen for treatment packages, over and above RSBY entitlement.
    
    Each family enrolled in the scheme is entitled for hospitalization benefits in Government empanelled hospitals (including both private and public). RSBY and SCHIS cover oncology treatment within prescribed benefits ceiling.
