      The Central Government has launched Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National AYUSH Mission (NAM) to develop and encourage the AYUSH system of medicine in the country. The Mission envisages better access to AYUSH services, strengthening of AYUSH educational institutions, enforcement of quality control of Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani & Homoeopathy (ASU &H) drugs and promotion of medicinal plants for sustainable availability of raw-materials for ASU & H drugs in the States/UTs.
      
      Under NAM grant-in-aid is being provided to State/UT Governments as per their proposed State Annual Action Plans (SAAPs). Since implementation of the programme comes under the purview of State/UT Governments, no target has been fixed by the Central Government State/UT wise. However, resource pool allocated under NAM for each State/UT Government is communicated to the States/UTs. Accordingly, States/UTs are required to prepare their State Annual Action Plans (SAAPs) as per their requirements in accordance with NAM guidelines.
      
      During 2014-15, under National AYUSH Mission (NAM) funds released by the Central Government is Rs. 7,528.707 lakhs and during the year 2015-16 and the year 2016-17 funds released by the central Government is Rs. 33,101.248 lakhs and Rs. 41711.849 lakhs respectively .
      
      This information was given by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) for AYUSH, Shri ShripadYesso Naik in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
