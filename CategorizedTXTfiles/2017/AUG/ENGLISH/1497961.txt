      Publicity on Drugs which Failed Quality Tests
      Posted On: 01 AUG 2017 4:29PM by PIB Delhi


    Both the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) and the state drug regulators pick up a large number of samples of drugs from all over the country and have them tested and analysed in the laboratories of the Central and State Governments. In a few cases, the samples tested and analysed do not meet the prescribed standards. The details of the drugs that do not meet the standards are immediately notified by the Central or State regulator concerned. In the case of samples picked up by CDSCO, the list of drugs declared as ‘Not of Standard Quality’ (NSQ)/ spurious/ adulterated/misbranded alongwith the names of respective manufacturers is regularly uploaded on the website of CDSCO (www.cdsco.nic.in) since 2012, under the heading “Drug Alert”. However, such data in respect of the samples picked up by State drug regulators is not maintained centrally.
    
    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
