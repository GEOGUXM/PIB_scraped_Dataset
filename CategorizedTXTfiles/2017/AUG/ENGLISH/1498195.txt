    Union Minister of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Sushri Bharti has said that a joint working group of officials from Indian and Israel should be set up soon to explore the areas of cooperation between both the countries in water resources management. The Minister expressed these views when the Israeli Ambassador to India Mr. Daniel Carmon called on her in New Delhi today. Sushri Bharti said Israel is a pioneer in the field of water management and India can learn a lot from them. She also suggested that use of treated water, PMKSY and mutual cooperation in the field of R&D and training of personnel could be some other areas of cooperation.


    The Israeli Ambassador said that a pilot project of waste water treatment can be taken up on Ganga at Varanasi. He also invited the Minister to visit Israel.


    It may be recalled that an MoU was signed between India and Israel in November 2016 to strengthen cooperation at the national, regional and international levels in the field of Water Resources Management and Development by collaborating and sharing experience and expertise in the areas mutually agreed upon, including techniques in the efficient use of water resources recycling/re-use of waste water, desalination, aquifer recharge and in-situ water conservation techniques, and water resource management
