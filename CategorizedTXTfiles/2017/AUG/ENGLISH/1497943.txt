      Every aircraft accident/incident is thoroughly investigated by a Court of Inquiry to ascertain the cause of accident and the recommendations of the completed Court of Inquiry are implemented. Various preventive measures are being taken including invigoration of Aviation Safety Organization, streamlining of accident/ incident reporting procedure, analytical studies and quality audits of the aircraft fleets to identify vulnerable areas to avoid aircraft accidents. Accident prevention programmes have been given an added thrust to identify risk prone/hazardous areas specific to the aircraft fleets and operational environment to ensure safe practices/procedures.

      An aircraft sometimes may have certain design deficiencies, which get duly rectified as it is exploited in service.
