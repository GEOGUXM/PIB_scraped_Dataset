    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, on Saturday met and interacted with a group of 80 Additional Secretaries and Joint Secretaries serving in the Government of India. This was the third of five such interactions.


    During the interaction, officers shared their experiences on subjects such as agriculture, drinking water, citizen-centric governance, innovation and teamwork in governance, project implementation, education, manufacturing, internal security, and solar energy.


    Prime Minister mentioned his PRAGATI initiative for project monitoring. On manufacturing, the Prime Minister said that the ecosystem for electronics manufacturing in India should now be focused on manufacture of medical equipment devices.


    The Prime Minister highlighted the importance of maintaining a positive working environment in Government, in order to make it an "organic entity." He said that as new laws are made, old ones should be reviewed and weeded out if found unnecessary.


    Highlighting the current positive global environment in favour of India, the Prime Minister asked officers to work with clear objectives towards creating a New India by 2022.


    He asked the officers to focus attention on the 100 most backward districts of India, so that they can be brought up to the national average level, on various development parameters.
