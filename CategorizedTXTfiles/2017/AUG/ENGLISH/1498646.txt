This is for the first time that within just a few days of assuming office, the President of India has called a separate meeting to acquaint himself with the President’s Military staff. Military Secretary to the President introduced the Military Wing of Rashtrapati Bhavan to the President, comprising DMSP, ADCs, Ceremonial Section, Invitation Section, Tour Section, Visitor’s Management Cell, Household Section, Sanitation Section, President’s Bodyguard and Ceremonial Guard Battalion. This is the first of such meetings scheduled to take place soon with the officers and staff of Rashtrapati Bhavan.

He, therefore, urged the officers and staff to rise to these expectations by fulfilling their respective responsibilities. He said that they should focus more on duties rather than rights and develop the values of sacrifice and discipline. He said that they should all be involved in the progress of the country and work together with honesty and dedication.
