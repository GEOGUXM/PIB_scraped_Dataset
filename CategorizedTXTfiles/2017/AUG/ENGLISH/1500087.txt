    The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said here today that youth aspiration will determine India’s future, as also the pace and pedestal of India’s ascent as a frontline world nation within next few years.

    
    Speaking at a seminar organised by ASSOCHAM on the occasion of World Entrepreneurs’ Day, Dr Jitendra Singh said, in a country like India, which has more than 70 percent population below the age of 40, any future programme will have to be youth- centric to be successful. In the same vein, he said, the various contours of future entrepreneurship will also have to be seen through the eyes of the youth.
    
    In the last 3 years, as a result of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s proactive outreach, Dr Jitendra Singh said, not only the foreign investors are finding India an attractive destination but even those Indians who had gone abroad and settled there several decades ago in search of green pastures, are now looking forward to an opportunity to come back to India and launch an enterprise.
    
    Dr Jitendra Singh observed, there is no dearth of aptitude amongst the youth which needs to be tapped. It is important to first understand what a given individual youth is capable of doing to his best, as much as it is equally important to understand what he is not capable of doing in spite of peer pressures or social compulsions, he said.
    
    To enable the future entrepreneurs to achieve to the maximum of their potential, Dr Jitendra Singh said, a mass awareness programme is required for a change in social behaviour. The youth can utilize their potential by taking advantage of the start-up scheme of the Government, he added
    
    Dr Jitendra Singh also disclosed that for the youngsters wishing to launch an entrepreneurship in Northeast, the Government of India’s “Start-up India, Stand-up India” Programme will be supplemented by an added incentive by Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) in the form of Venture Fund.
    
    Israeli Ambassador Mr Daniel Carmon, President ASSOCHAM Shri Sandeep Jajodia and Secretary General ASSOCHAM Shri DS Rawat, among others, also spoke on the occasion.
