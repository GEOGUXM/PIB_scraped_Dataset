      Misleading Advertisements
      Posted On: 01 AUG 2017 4:40PM by PIB Delhi


    The Department of Consumer Affairs has launched a portal “Grievance against Misleading Advertisement (GAMA)” where a consumer can lodge a complaint against a misleading advertisement. From March, 2015 till date 4438 complaints have been received through this portal. The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) processes the complaints received through this portal as per ASCI Code, based on an MoU signed between the Department and the ASCI. If a complaint is upheld, ASCI takes up the complaint with the company/agency concerned either for withdrawal or modification of the advertisement. In case of non-compliance of its orders, ASCI forwards the complaints to the regulators concerned for taking appropriate action.


    The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Food, Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution, which examined the Consumer Protection Bill, 2015, already introduced in Parliament, has recommended for stringent provisions to tackle misleading advertisement, as well as to fix liability on endorsers/celebrities. The recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee are under consideration of the Government.


    This information was given by Shri C. R. Chaudhary, the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha, today.
