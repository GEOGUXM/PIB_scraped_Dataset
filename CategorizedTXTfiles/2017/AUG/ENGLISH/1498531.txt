    Procurement of defence equipment is undertaken from various domestic as well as foreign vendors, based on threat perception, operational challenges and technological changes and to keep the Armed Forces in a state of readiness to meet the entire spectrum of security challenges.

    
    During the last three years and in the current year, 99 contracts with Indian vendors and 61 contracts with foreign vendors have been signed for capital procurement of defence equipment such as aircraft, helicopters, rockets, missiles, artillery gun, frigates, simulators and ammunition.
    
    Government is pursuing initiatives to achieve higher levels of indigenisation and self-reliance in the defence sector by harnessing the capabilities of the public and private sector industries in the country. These measures include according priority and preference to procurement from Indian vendors and liberalization of the licensing regime.
    
    Government has also promulgated the policy on Strategic Partnership in the Defence Sector which is intended to institutionalise a transparent and objective mechanism to encourage broader participation of the private sector in manufacture of major defence platforms and equipment.
    
    This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Dr. Manoj Rajoria and others in Lok Sabha today.
