    The Minister of State (IC) For Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and Mines, Shri Piyush Goyal, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today, informed the House that as on 1 st August, 2017, Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) has distributed 25.28 crore LED bulbs and the private sector has also sold 41.44 crore LED bulbs up to June, 2017, to domestic consumers throughout the country, against Government’s target to replace 77 crore incandescent bulbs with LED bulbs by March, 2019.


    Further, the Minister informed that as on 1 st August, 2017, EESL’s distributing over 25.28 crore LED bulbs in 36 States and UTs across India alone has resulted in estimated energy savings of more than 32.84 billion kWh per year with avoided peak demand of 6575 MW and GHG emission reduction of 26.60 Million tonnes CO 2 per year. In addition, there are savings due to sale of LED bulbs by the private sector. The State/UT-wise estimated energy savings are as follows:

    Shri Goyal stated that EESL’s procurements conform to BIS specification IS 16102 (Part 2): 2012 for performance requirements of self-ballast lamps. Further, these bulbs carry a 3-year free replacement warranty against technical defects. There are stringent quality checks to ensure the quality of LED bulbs. No specific complaints have been received regarding excessive charging and lack of interest by distributing agencies under UJALA scheme. EESL has deployed field monitoring staff to take care of such issues, if any, the Minister added.


    Shri Goyal also informed that under the UJALA Scheme, EESL aggregates the demand and procures LED bulbs through competitive bidding process to get the lowest price compared to retail market. The consumers, having metered connection, can acquire LED bulbs from designated distribution centres set up at various locations across the country. LED bulbs are being distributed on upfront payment basis and on-bill finance scheme in 36 States and UTs across India under UJALA scheme.
