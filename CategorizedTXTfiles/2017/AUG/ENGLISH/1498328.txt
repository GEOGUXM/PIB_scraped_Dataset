      Posted On: 03 AUG 2017 5:22PM by PIB Delhi


    The estimates of national income (measured as net national income) and per capita income (measured as per capita net national income) of the country during the last three years are as under:


    Item (at current prices) 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17


    Net National Income (Rs. crore) 10953761 12076882 13408211


    Per Capita Net National Income (Rs.) 86454 94130 103219


    Annual estimates of net state domestic product (NSDP) and per capita income (measured as per capita NSDP) are compiled by all the States/UTs except UTs of Daman & Diu, Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Lakshadweep. As per latest reports, data for the 33 States/UTs is available till the year 2014-15. The information is given in the statement at Annexure-I.


    The Government has been implementing several programmes for skill development, self-employment, wage employment and creation of assets that aim to promote inclusive growth and thereby bridge the income gaps. These include Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihood Mission (DAY-NULM) of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (MHUPA) and various rural development schemes of the Department of Rural Development (DRD), namely, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana Gramin (PMAYG), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAYNRLM) and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya-Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY).


    The State/UT-wise details of per capita income for the year 1989-90 (before 1991 economic reforms) and for the year 1992-93 (after 1991 economic reforms) are given in the statement at Annexure-II. State/UT-wise per capita income for the year 2014-15 (latest available) is included in the statement given at Annexure-I.


    Level of inequality is assessed in terms of Lorenz ratios of monthly per capita expenditure distribution using consumer expenditure data of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). The NSSO 68 th round report for the year 2011-12 noted that there was an increase in inequality (in terms of Lorenz ratio) from 0.297 to 0.307 for the rural sector and from 0.373 to 0.385 for the urban sector, when compared to the data of 61 st round for the year 2004-05. Reasons for increase were not surveyed.


    Comparison of inequality in terms of Lorenz ratios at State level based on NSSO 68 th round (2011-12) data and 66 th round (2009-10) data indicates that inequality in rural sector increased in all States/ UTs except for Sikkim, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab. During this period, in respect of the urban sector, inequality increased in Manipur, Mizoram, Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Arunachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Haryana and Kerala.
