      Posted On: 02 AUG 2017 4:58PM by PIB Delhi


    The Ministry of Tourism has recognised Medical and Wellness Tourism including Ayurveda as a Niche product in order to overcome the aspect of ‘seasonality’ and to promote India as a 365 days’ destination and attract tourists with specific interest.


    A National Medical and Wellness Tourism Board has been constituted to provide a dedicated institutional framework to take forward the cause of promotion of Medical and Wellness Tourism including Ayurveda and any other format of Indian system of medicine covered by Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH). India as a destination for Ayurveda is also promoted through the Global Incredible India campaign and by the Indiatourism offices through participation in trade fairs, promotional events, roads hows and seminars.


    This information was given by Dr. Mahesh Sharma, Minister of State for Tourism and Culture (Independent Charge) in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
