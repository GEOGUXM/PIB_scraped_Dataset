    The cooking cost which includes the cost of vegetables, pulses, oil, condiments & fuel is being upwardly revised annually since 01.04.2010. The cooking cost has been enhanced by 7% w.e.f. 01.07.2016 and it now stands at Rs.4.13 and Rs.6.18 per child per day for primary and upper primary stages respectively. Besides the above, the Central Government provides 100% funding for foodgrains, transport assistance, kitchen devices and Management/Monitoring Expenses. Several State/UT Governments are also contributing additional funds over and above their minimum mandatory share under Mid Day Meal Scheme. Food grains under mid day meal scheme are provided through Food Corporation of India (FCI) to States/UTs at rates under National Food Security Act i.e Rs. 2 and Rs. 3 per kg for wheat and Rice respectively. The economic cost of wheat is Rs. 23.45 per kg and that of rice is Rs. 32.67 per kg.


    The Central Government has notified the Mid Day Meal Rules, 2015 in September, 2015 under the National Food Security Act, 2013. These Rules, inter-alia, provide that hot cooked meal provided to children shall be evaluated and certified by the Government Food Research Laboratory or any other laboratory accredited or recognized by law so as to ensure that the meal meets with the prescribed nutritional standards and quality. The samples are to be collected at least once in a month from randomly selected schools or centralized kitchens for testing by such laboratories.


    The Mid Day Meal Guidelines prescribe the following nutritional content and calorie count to achieve the objectives of the Scheme in the mid day meal:
