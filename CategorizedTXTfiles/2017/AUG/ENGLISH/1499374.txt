      T he Central Government is executing Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS) to implement the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act), in which State Governments/UT Administrations have major role to play. The Ministry has been requesting the State Governments/UT Administrations from time to time to identify and register all Child Care Institutions (CCIs) including Observation Homes, Special Homes and Observation cum Special Homes under relevant provisions of JJ Act and set up functional inspection and other Committees to ensure that children in all the CCIs receive the best of care, and are not subject to any kind of abuse and neglect. The State Governments/UT Administrations are also required to ensure, through regular inspection and monitoring, that the institutions are run as per the provisions of the JJ Act and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rule, 2016 framed there-under.


      The financial norms under ICPS were revised with effect from 1st April, 2014. Some of the key features of the revised Scheme are, increased maintenance grant for children in homes, from existing Rs. 750 to Rs. 2000 per child per month; enhanced cost of construction from existing provision of Rs. 600 per sq. feet to Rs. 1000 per sq. feet and flexibility in the staffing pattern in service delivery structures, depending on the size and need of the State/UT.


      The details of number of Observation homes, Special homes presently functioning in the country for children in conflict with law and being funded under Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS) is given below:
