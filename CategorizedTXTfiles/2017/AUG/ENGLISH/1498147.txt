    Modern Coach Factory (MCF), Raebareli has been planned to have an installed capacity of 1000 coaches per year. In addition, a factory has been set up at Haldia, West Bengal, for furnishing of 100 Diesel Electrical Multiple Unit (DEMU) coaches every year. However both, Modern Coach Factory (MCF), Raebareli, and DEMU Coach Factory, Haldia, are still in the stabilization phase and their outturn is planned to increase gradually.


    The demand for rail service is dynamic and decreases/increases depending upon seasonal variations, growth of passenger traffic, etc. The requirement of the coaches is based on these factors and gets included in the annual Coach Production Programme. The production of coaches is normally commensurate with the requirement.


    The Indian Railways have procured Mainline Electric Multiple Unit (MEMU)/ Alternating Current Electrical Multiple Unit (ACEMU) coaches from private manufacturers in the past, but no such order has been placed on private manufacturers during the last three years.
