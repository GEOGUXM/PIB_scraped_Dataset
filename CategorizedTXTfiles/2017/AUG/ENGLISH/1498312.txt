      Posted On: 03 AUG 2017 5:11PM by PIB Delhi


    The NGT during the course of hearing in O.A. No. 200/2014 (M.C. Mehta Vs. Union of India & Ors.) have made certain adverse observations on efficacy of various schemes and programmes undertaken for cleaning of river Ganga.


    The government has intensified its efforts for pollution abatement of river Ganga. Cleaning of river Ganga is being carried out through various activities including treatment of municipal sewage, treatment of industrial effluent, river surface cleaning, rural sanitation, afforestation and bio-diversity etc. The municipal sewage being generated in cities on banks of Ganga is being managed by a mix of Interception and Diversion projects, sewerage network and Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) projects. As per condition assessment and feasibility study carried out by National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), 3078 Million Litres Per Day (MLD) of sewage is generated by the towns situated on the main stem of river Ganga. As of today, sewage treatment capacity available is 1315 Mld. National Mission for Clean Ganga has already approved projects for creation of additional 1075 Mld and these projects are at various stages of implementation.


    The year-wise quantum of amount allocated and spent for Namami Gange Mission from Financial year 2014-15 to 2017-18 till 30 th June, 2017 is tabulated below:
