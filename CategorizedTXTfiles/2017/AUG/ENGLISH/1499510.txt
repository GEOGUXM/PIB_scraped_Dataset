The index for ‘Manufacture of Textiles’ group declined by 0.3 percent to 113.4 (provisional) from 113.7 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of viscose yarn (3%), manufacture of cordage, rope, twine & netting (2%) and woollen yarn, cotton yarn and manufacture of other textiles (1% each). However, the price of manufacture of knitted and crocheted fabrics (2%) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Wood and of Products of Wood and Cork’ group rose by 0.9 percent to 131.7 (provisional) from 130.5 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of lamination wooden sheets/veneer sheets and particle boards (3% each) and wooden block-compressed or not (1%). However, the price of timber/wooden plank & sawn/resawn (2%) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Pharmaceuticals, Medicinal Chemical and Botanical Products’ group declined by 0.2 percent to 120.0 (provisional) from 120.2 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of simvastatin (12%), anti cancer drugs (3%) and antioxidants, cotton wool (medicinal) and steroids and hormonal preparations (including anti-fungal preparations) (1% each). However, the price of anti allergic drugs and antibiotics & preparations thereof (3% each) and antipyretic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory formulations (1%) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Rubber and Plastics Products’ group declined by 0.6 percent to 107.9 (provisional) from 108.5 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of plastic components (4%), processed rubber, medium & heavy commercial vehicle tyre, rubber moulded goods, plastic tank, rubber crumb and polypropylene film (2% each) and rubberized dipped fabric, solid rubber tyres/wheels and polyester film (non-metalized) (1% each). However, the price of v belt (6%), rubber cloth/sheet (5%), plastic button (4%), cycle/cycle rickshaw tyre (3%) and acrylic/plastic sheet, tooth brush and elastic webbing (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Fabricated Metal Products, Except Machinery and Equipment’ group declined by 0.2 percent to 107.8 (provisional) from 108.0 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of bolts, screws, nuts & nails of iron & steel and stainless steel razor (3% each), forged steel rings (2%) and hose pipes in set or otherwise and pressure cooker (1% each). However, the price of steel door (2%) and steel drums and barrels, steel structures, electrical stamping- laminated or otherwise and copper bolts, screws, nuts (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Computer, Electronic and Optical Products’ group rose by 0.7 percent to 109.3 (provisional) from 108.5 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of microscope (9%), meter (non-electrical), colour tv and computer peripherals (2% each) and ups in solid state drives and capacitors (1% each). However, the price of watch (2%) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Motor Vehicles, Trailers and Semi-Trailers’ group declined by 0.4 percent to 111.1 (provisional) from 111.6 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of cylinder liners (5%), radiators & coolers and engine (2% each) and light, medium & heavy commercial vehicles, minibus/bus, filter element and wheels/wheels & parts (1% each). However, the price of brake pad/brake liner/brake block/brake rubber, others (4%), head lamp and crankshaft (3% each) and body (for commercial motor vehicles), shock absorbers, piston ring/piston and compressor, seat for motor vehicles and gear box and parts (1% each) moved up.
