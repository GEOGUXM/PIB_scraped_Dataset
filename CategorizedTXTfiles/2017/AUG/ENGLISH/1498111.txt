      Posted On: 02 AUG 2017 3:05PM by PIB Delhi


    The primary responsibility of industrial development of backward areas rests with the State Governments. The Union Government supplements their efforts through various Schemes launched by it with a view to promote industrialization in industrially backward areas of the Country. Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) was implementing Schemes for development of North East region and Special Package Scheme for Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu & Kashmir, which have now ended.


    Section 94 of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 provides that the Central Government shall take appropriate fiscal measures, including offer of tax incentives to the State of Andhra and the State of Telangana, to promote industrialization and economic growth in both the States. Government of Andhra Pradesh has submitted a proposal for formulation of Entrepreneurship Facilitation Scheme.
