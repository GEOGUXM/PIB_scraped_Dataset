    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind in his message on the eve of Janmashtami has said:-


    “On the auspicious occasion of Janmashtami, I extend my warm greetings and best wishes to all my fellow citizens.


    The ideals of Lord Krishna’s life are of universal relevance. His message of standing up for righteousness against evil, working for universal well-being and focusing on responsibilities rather than rewards is inspiring for all.


    Let us commit ourselves to following the path of virtue shown by Lord Krishna and strengthen our society and nation by contributing to the well-being of our people”.
