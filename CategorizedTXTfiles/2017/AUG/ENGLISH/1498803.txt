      The techniques of Yoga are widely used for de-addiction and rehabilitation of drug users in de-addiction centres. Yoga helps in the de-addiction and rehabilitation of the drug users in de-addiction centres. The yogic protocol includes specific Asanas, Pranayamas, Shatkriyas and Meditation.
      
      The Ministry of AYUSH has not set up specific de-addiction centres due to the fact that the yogic techniques are widely used in most of the existing de-addiction centres.
      
      This information was given by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) for AYUSH, Shri ShripadYesso Naik in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
