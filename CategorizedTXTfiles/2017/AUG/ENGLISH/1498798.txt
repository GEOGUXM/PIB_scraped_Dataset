      As per the operational requirement of Army, Long Term Roll on Works Plan of Border Roads Organisation (BRO) for five years (2015-2020) has been formulated to include 519 roads of length measuring 22,225 km for construction / improvement by BRO.


      Out of above 519 roads, 61 roads of length measuring 3417 Km have been identified as strategic Indo-China Border Roads (ICBR). In addition to meeting the operational requirement, the above mentioned roads, on completion, would also enhance accessibility to border areas including areas where the border infrastructure and forward connectivity is lacking.
