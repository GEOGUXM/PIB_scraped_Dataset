      Posted On: 03 AUG 2017 2:37PM by PIB Delhi


    The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has constituted an Inter Ministerial Committee to pursue implementation of the Expert Committee's recommendations. So far, four Inter Ministerial Committee meetings have been held.
    
    The Registrar General of India (RGI), during Enumeration of Census 2011, for the first time provided three codes i.e. Male-1, Female â€“2 and others -3 for enumeration. This was at the discretion of the respondent. In case the respondent wished to record neither '1' nor '2', then enumerator was instructed to record sex as 'other' and give code '3'. Still, it is important to note that the Census on India does not collect any data specifically on 'transgender'. Thus, the category of 'other' would not only include 'transgender' but also any person who desires to record sex under the category of 'other'. It is also possible that some transgenders would have returned themselves either male or female depending upon their choice. The population of 'other' as per Census 2011 is 4,87,803.
    
    The Bill titled "The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016" was introduced by the Ministry in the Lok Sabha on 2.8.2016. The Bill was referred to the Lok Sabha Standing Committee on Social Justice and Empowerment for examination and report. The Committee has submitted its report on 21.07.2017.
    
    The Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) has informed that they are providing employment opportunities to 23 transgenders who work alongside the Kudumbashree women in customer service operations.
    
    This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Vijay Sampla in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
