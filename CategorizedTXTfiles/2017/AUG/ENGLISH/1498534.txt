    Government is committed to the goal of achieving self reliance in meeting national security objectives. The ‘Make in India’ initiative is the focal point of the current defence procurement policy and procedure and aims to promote indigenous design, development and manufacturing of defence equipment, platforms and systems, involving the public and private sector in the country.

    
    As an important step towards meeting broader national objectives, Government has recently promulgated the Strategic Partnership Policy to facilitate broader participation of the private sector, in addition to DPSUs / OFB, in manufacture of major defence platforms and equipment such as aircraft, submarines, helicopters and armoured vehicles. It is expected that the implementation of the Policy will enhance competition, increase efficiencies, facilitate faster and more significant absorption of technology and create a tiered industrial ecosystem in the country, including in the MSME Sector. The award of contracts in such cases will be through a transparent and competitive process. The policy is expected to contribute to building indigenous capabilities within the country in respect of the identified segments.
    
    This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri Devusinh Chauhan and others in Lok Sabha today.
