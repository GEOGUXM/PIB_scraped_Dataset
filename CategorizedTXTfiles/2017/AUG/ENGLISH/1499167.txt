        The Minister further stated that the Government of India has revised the National Solar Mission target of Grid Connected Solar Power projects from 20,000 MW by 2022 to 100,000 MW by 2022. The same is sought to be achieved through rooftop solar projects (40,000 MW) and ground mounted solar projects (60,000 MW), the Minister added.


        In a written reply to another question, the Minister said that No specific ‘Solar Energy Policy’ has been formulated. However, the Government has launched following schemes to promote solar energy,:


        i. Solar Park Scheme for setting up of over 50 Solar Parks and Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects targeting over 40,000 MW of solar power projects.


        ii. Scheme for setting up 1000 MW of Grid-Connected Solar PV Power Projects by Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) and Government of India organisations with Viability Gap Funding (VGF).


        iii. Scheme for setting up 300 MW of Grid-Connected Solar PV Power Projects by Defence Establishments and Para Military Forces with VGF.


        iv. Pilot-cum-demonstration projects for development of grid connected solar PV power plants on canal banks and canal tops.


        v. Bundling Scheme - 15000 MW grid-connected solar PV power plants through NTPC Ltd./ NVVN.


        vi. VGF Scheme for setting up of 2000 MW of Grid Connected Solar PV Power Projects through SECI.


        vii. VGF Scheme for setting up of 5000 MW of Grid Connected Solar PV Power Projects through SECI.


        viii. Installation of Grid Connected Solar Rooftop Power Plants.
