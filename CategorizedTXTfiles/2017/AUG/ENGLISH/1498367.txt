    Instructions were issued by Department of Personnel and Training on 01.06.2017 to all Ministries/Departments to collect information about appointments made on the basis of fake/ false caste certificates and follow up action taken thereon. The Ministries/Departments have been requested to collect information from all Organisations under their administrative control about the cases where the candidates got/alleged to have got appointment against vacancies reserved for Scheduled Cates, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes on the basis of false/fake caste certificate and send a consolidated report to the Department of Personnel and Training by 15.07.2017. In the response received so far from eight Ministries/Departments, no such case has been reported.

    
    The extant instructions provide that if it is found that a Government servant had furnished false information or produced a false certificate in order to secure appointment, he should not be retained in service. Thus when an appointing authority comes to know that an employee had submitted a false/fake caste certificate, it has to initiate action to remove or dismiss such an employee from service as per the provisions of relevant Service Rules.
    
    Further, in order to discourage unscrupulous persons getting benefits through false caste certificates, State Governments/Union Territories have also been requested to consider issue of appropriate instructions for initiating disciplinary proceeding against the errant officers who default in timely verifications of caste certificate or issue false certificates.
    
    This was stated by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question by Shri Ram Vichar Netam and Smt. Vijila Sathyananth in the Rajya Sabha today.
