    The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the construction of double line with electrification between Vanchi-Maniyachchi- Nagercoil via Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu.
    
    The total length of the line will be 102 km. The estimated cost of the Project will be Rs.1003.94 crore and completion cost of Rs.1114.62 crore with 5% escalation per annum.
    
    The project is likely to be completed in four years by 2020-21. The project will generate direct employment during construction for 24.48 lakh mandays.
    
    The project would not only speed up the operation of goods and coaching trains, but also provide additional capacity for meeting the increase in traffic in future.
    
    Background:
    
    Vanchi-Maniyachchi- Nagercoil via Tirunelveli is an important trunk route serving Southern end of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The section is heavily passenger oriented which also serve the goods traffic from nearby ports. Present line capacity of the section has already gone beyond 90% which is causing detention to the moving trains. Line capacity of this route needs to be enhanced to meet the demands for additional trains and smooth movement of trains through the route. Hence, doubling of Vanchi-Maniyachchi- Nagercoil via Tirunelveli with electrification needs to be taken up.
