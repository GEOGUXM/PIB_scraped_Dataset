      Scanners at LOC trade facilitation centres
      Posted On: 02 AUG 2017 4:19PM by PIB Delhi


    Full Body Truck Scanners (FBTS) involve high end technology which require extensive technical evaluation for finalization of Qualitative Requirements (QRs) as well for examining bids by various specialist agencies. The infrastructure for installation of FBTS also involves elaborate civil work including clearance of soil reports etc. Also, No Objection Certificate (NOC) from Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) and Bhaba Atomic Research Centre(BARC) is required in view of the technology that involves radiations. Hence, though the global tender was floated on 26th February, 2015, price bid could only be opened on 26th July, 2016. Contract would be awarded on completion of all requisite formalities. Hence, it cannot be said that delay has occurred in this matter.


    Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) and Guidelines have been issued from time to time to regulate and mitigate the security concerns in the Cross LoC Trade.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question by Sh. Anand Sharma in the Rajya Sabha today.
