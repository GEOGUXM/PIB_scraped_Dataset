      The Minister of State (I/C) for Youth Affairs and Sports Shri Vijay Goel said in the Rajya Sabha today that the Sports is a State subject and, therefore, it is primarily the responsibility of the State Government to promote and develop Sports in the country.

      In order to revive such games and promote them among the masses, SAI has adopted the following indigenous games disciplines for their promotion:


      a) Kalaripayatu, Kerala


      b) Silambam, Tamilnadu


      c) Kabaddi, Telengana


      d) Archery, Jharkhand


      e) Malkhamb, Maharashtra


      f) Mukna, Imphal


      g) Thangta, Imphal


      h) Khomlainai, Assam


      i) Gatka, Punjab


      The trainees and the schools adopted in the IGMA scheme are provided with the sports kit, accidental insurance including medical, stipend, annual grant to the school for purchase of equipment and for organizing competitions for scouting talent.
