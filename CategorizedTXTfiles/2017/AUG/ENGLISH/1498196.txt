    In a great gesture of solidarity with our soldiers, children and women from Tamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Assam and Sikkim are sending thousands of Rakhis to the jawans in Siachen, Jaisalmer and Sikkim. These Rakhis were received from school children and women by Minister of State for Defence Dr Subhash Bhamre on behlf of the soldiers.


    Speaking on the occasion, Dr Bhamre said that the country is with the jawans who are alert on the borders in most difficult conditions. It is a kind gesture from the women folk of the country to express their love and affection towards these brave hearts.


    These Rakhis are handmade. Little children, especially girls, are sending wonderful Rakhis and greeting cards with sweet messages to our soldiers who work round-the-clock in the most inhospitable conditions. The school children also tie Rakhis to some soldiers on the occasion.
