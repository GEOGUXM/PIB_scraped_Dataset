        The mandate of the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) is to provide services for weather, climate, ocean and coastal state, hydrology, seismology and natural hazards; to explore marine living and nonliving resources in a sustainable way and to explore the three polar regions (Arctic, Antarctic and Himalayas). To achieve this mandate, the research & development and operational activities of MoES are carried out under the following five major programs:


        1. Atmosphere and Climate Research – Modelling, Observing Systems and Services (ACROSS).


        2. Ocean Services, Technology, Observations, Resources, Modelling and Science (OSTORMS).


        3. Polar and Cryosphere Research (PACER).


        4. Seismology and Geosciences (SAGE).


        5. Research, Education, Outreach and Training (REACHOUT).


        The progress and details of these schemes during the above period are as follows:

        The quality of weather services by the Ministry has shown appreciable improvements during the past 3 years. The loss of lives during the last 3 years sue to tropical cyclones has reduced to less than hundred as compared to the thousands during the previous decade. For example, the famous 1999 Super Cyclone in Orissa killed more than 10,000 people while the same intense Phailin claimed only less than 20 people in Orissa. This large reduction in casualties is attributed to substantial improvement in monitoring and prediction of tropical cyclones.


        MoES for the first time started issuing forecasts for heat waves over the country. The heat wave forecasts issued during the 2016 hot weather season (April to May) were very successful. A few state governments like Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Maharastra and Odisha have initiated state actions plans based on these forecasts during the hot weather season, which could help them to warn people in advance about the occurrence of heat waves and thus saving their lives.


        The third party assessment by the National Council if Applied Economic Research (NCAER) on the Agro-meteorological Advisory Services provided by the India Meteorological Department concluded that the annual economic benefit for the farmers cultivating 4 principal crops (Wheat, Rice, Sugarcane and Cotton) was Rs. 42,000 Crore in 2015.


        The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) provides PFZ advisories to 2.75 lakh fisherman on a daily basis to help them to easily locate the areas of abundant fish in the ocean. As per the 2015 report of NCAER, the Fishermen in the country made an annual profit of Rs. 3000 crores from these PFZ advisories and the cumulative economic benefits exceeding Rs. 370000 crores have been accrued from these ocean forecasts.


        Ocean State Forecasts (forecasts of waves, currents, sea surface temperature, etc.) to fisher folk, shipping industry, oil and natural gas industry. Navy, Coast Guard and other stakeholders have improved considerably during the last 3 years. Oil spill advisories are being provided to facilitate the indication of eco-sensitive zones, potential fishing zones, fishing avoidance zone during the event of oil spill. About 16.5 lakh users are currently receiving the OSF.


        This information was given by Minister of State for Science & Technology and Earth Sciences Shri Y.S.Chowdary in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
