    As part of the celebrations to mark the 71st year of Independence, a multi-media show highlighting the role and contribution of the Indian Armed Forces post-Independence, will be organised at the India Gate lawns from tomorrow. The show will comprise a mix of beam laser show, movie clips, 3D mapping and laser animation.

    
    The theme of the show is ‘Armed Forces – Pride of the Nation’. It will depict the role of the Armed Forces not only as guardians of the nation’s frontiers, but also their contribution in nation building through maintaining peace, promoting developmental activities, conducting disaster relief operations, participation in games & sports and United Nations peacekeeping operations.
    
    The show will be open for public viewing from August 12 to 18 inside the India Gate Circle. The timings will be from 1900 hours to 2200 hours. Each show will be of 30 minutes duration, repeated three to four times. Citizens are requested to join hands in salute to our great nation which has come a long way in the last 70 years of Independence and also in saluting our Armed Forces.
