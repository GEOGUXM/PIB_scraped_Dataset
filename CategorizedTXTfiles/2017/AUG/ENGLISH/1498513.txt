      Posted On: 04 AUG 2017 1:14PM by PIB Delhi


    The allocation of funds for health sector is based, inter-alia, on the availability of resources and competing claims on these resources. An increase in economic growth makes available increased resources for funding the health sector. In addition to this, availability of overall resources, past utilization, requirements and absorptive capacity inter-alia guide the allocations to the health sector.


    The National Health Policy 2017 proposes raising public health expenditure to 2.5% of the GDP in a time bound manner by 2025.
