    BSNL was the first operator to provide free national roaming on 15th June 2015. Following the same, it has now decided to allow the benefit of Voice/SMS, Special Tariff Voucher (STV) and Combo Vouchers in national roaming on the occasion of 71st independence day on PAN India basis with effect from 15 August’ 2017 in the area where BSNL operates.


    The offer is beneficial to those who frequently travel including our jawans and journalists. Presently if you for any STV, the benefit is available in the home state/ Licence Service Area (LSA), but from 15th August this benefit will be available even when a person travels outside his home LSA.


    For example, STV 349 which offers unlimited voice call to any network only in home LSA, now the benefit of unlimited voice call on any network will be available even when customer is travelling out from Home LSA in any area where BSNL operates.
