      Posted On: 08 AUG 2017 5:05PM by PIB Delhi


    The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 provides a consumer the right to be informed about the quality, quantity, potency, purity, standard and price of goods or services.


    In so far as drugs are concerned, the manufacture, sell and distribution of drugs is regulated under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules, 1945. The said Rules require various statutory details on the label of the drugs. However, labelling of drugs in regional Indian languages is not mandatory in the said Rules. As regards bank pass books, the Reserve Bank of India has issued a circular in July, 2011 to all the scheduled banks to the effect that in order to ensure that banking facilities percolate to the vast sections of the population, banks should make available all printed material used by retail customers including account opening forms, pay-in-slips, passbooks etc in trilingual form, i.e., English, Hindi and the concerned Regional language.


    This information was given by Shri C. R. Chaudhary, the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha, today.
