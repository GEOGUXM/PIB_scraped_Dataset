    The National Civil Aviation Policy, 2016 has envisaged growth of cargo volumes to 10 million tonnes by 2027. As per data maintained by the Airports Authority of India (AAI), air freight handled at Indian airports grew by more than 20 times from 0.08 million metric tonnes in 1972-73 to 2.5 million metric tonnes in 2014-15, and its compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was 8.8% during 2013-14 to 2016-17. Measured in million tonne-kilometers, the data maintained by the World Bank also shows that air freight transported by India went up from 96.3 million tonne-kilometers in 1970 to 1,833.8 million tonne-kilometers in 2015.

    
    The Ministry of Civil Aviation had set up a Committee on Air Cargo Community System (ACCS) composed of various stakeholders, including customs authorities, and it was decided to grant approval to AAI for appointment of consultant to prepare a Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the development of a uniform and integrated web-based ACCS in the country, based on the above Committee's recommendations.
