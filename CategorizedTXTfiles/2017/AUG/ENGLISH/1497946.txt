    Government is expanding health infrastructure and human resources, besides bringing in new interventions to increase the accessibility to health services.


    The details of steps taken to stabilize increasing population are given below:


    STEPS TAKEN TO CHECK THE INCREASE IN POPULATION ARE:

      * Mission ParivarVikas has been launched to increase access to contraceptives and Family Planning services in 146 high fertility districts.
      * Introduction of New Contraceptive Choices: The current basket of choice has been expanded to include the new contraceptives viz. Injectable contraceptive, Centchroman and Progesterone Only Pills (POP).
      * Redesigned Contraceptive Packaging: The packaging for Condoms, Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCPs) and Emergency Contraceptive Pills (ECPs) has now been improved and redesigned.
      * New Family Planning Media Campaign has been launched to generate demand for contraceptives.
      * Family Planning logistics management information system has been developed to track Family Planning commodities.
      * Enhanced Compensation Scheme for Sterilization: The sterilization compensation scheme has been enhanced in 11 high focus states (8 Empowered Action Group (EAG), Assam, Gujarat, Haryana)
      * Post Abortion Family Planning Services have been initiated.
      * A Scheme for ensuring drop back services to sterilization clients has been initiated.
      * A Scheme for Home delivery of contraceptives by ASHAs to provide contraceptives at the doorstep of beneficiaries is in operation.
      * A Scheme to ensure spacing of births by ASHAs is in operation.
      * World Population Day & fortnight as well as Vasectomy Fortnight is observed every yearto boost Family Planning efforts all over the country.
      * Post partum Family Planning is being focused with special emphasis on Post partum IUCD services.
      * Quality Assurance Committees have been established in all state and districts for ensuring quality of care in Family Planning.
      * Cu IUCD 375 with 5 years effectivityhas been introduced in the programme as an alternative to the existing IUCD (Cu IUCD 380A with effectivity of 10 years).
      * Male participation is being emphasized upon.
      * Under National Family Planning Indemnity Scheme the clients are indemnified in the unlikely events of deaths, complications and failures following sterilization.
      * Private/ NGO facilities have been accredited to increase the provider base for family planning services under PPP

    As a result the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) has declined to 2.2 (NFHS IV) and the Decadal growth rate has declined to 17.64 % as per Census 2011.
