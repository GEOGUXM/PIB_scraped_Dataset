    Government of India approved the National Mission on Electric Mobility in 2011 and subsequently National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020 was unveiled in 2013. Under the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020, Government of India has an ambitious target to achieve 60-70 lakh sales of hybrid and electric vehicles by 2020.


    As part of the mission, Department of Heavy Industry formulated a scheme namely FAME -India [Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India]. The overall scheme is proposed to be implemented over a period of 6 years, till 2020, wherein it is intended to support the hybrid / electric vehicles market development and its manufacturing eco-system to achieve self-sustenance at the end of the stipulated period. At present, the Phase-1 of the scheme is being implemented, which was originally for a period of 2 years commencing from 1st April 2015 till 31st March 2017, and has now been extended for a further period of 6 months till 30th September 2017.


    Since FAME India Scheme, at present, is not applicable PAN-India in totality, the Department captures the data of vehicles which are sold under Demand Creation focus area of the scheme, whereby demand incentive is extended for purchase of electric & hybrid vehicles in these covered areas. Under the scheme, a total of 1,50,550 electric/hybrid vehicles were extended incentive as on 26th July 2017.


    This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Lok Sabha today.
