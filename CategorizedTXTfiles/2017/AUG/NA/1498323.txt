      Assessment of sewage load through major drains discharging into main stem of river Ganga and its major tributaries is carried out under Pollution Inventorisation, Assessment and Surveillance of river Ganga project undertaken by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) under Namami Gange Programme. As per CPCB data of 2016-17, 10705 MLD of flow (which includes sewer as well as non-sewer/natural flow) was estimated from 211 drains outfalling in river Ganga and its tributaries namely Ramganga, Kali (East) and Pandu. As per condition assessment and feasibility study carried out by National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), sewage generation from the 108 towns located on the main stem of river Ganga was estimated to be 3078 MLD.


      As per the CPCB 2016-17 data, 1109 Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) have been identified on the main stem of River Ganga and major Tributaries. Surprise inspection of these GPIs is done on regular basis for compliance verification as per the industry discharge standards and action is taken against the defaulting industries as per the provisions contained in Environment Protection Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.
