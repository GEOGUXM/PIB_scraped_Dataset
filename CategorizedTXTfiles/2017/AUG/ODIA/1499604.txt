      “Equal pay for equal work in CPSUs”
      Posted On: 09 AUG 2017 6:32PM by PIB Bhubaneshwar


    Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) are under the administrative control of their respective Ministries / Departments and CPSEs are required to follow the various statutory provisions / Court orders / Government instructions including instructions on wage related issues of various categories of employees, wherever applicable. However, the responsibility to monitor the implementation of above said statutory provisions / court orders / Government instructions vests with the Board of CPSEs and the concerned administrative Ministry / Department. As such, no centralized information in this regard is maintained by Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) and accordingly no status report on implementation of Supreme Court verdict on equal pay for equal work with reference to the contractual and temporary employees in CPSEs is also maintained in Department of Public Enterprises.


    This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Rajya Sabha today.
