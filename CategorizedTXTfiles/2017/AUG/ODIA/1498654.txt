    The Minister of State (IC) For Power, Coal, New & Renewable Energy and Mines, Shri Piyush Goyal, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today, informed the House that interventions under Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) including reduction in interest costs & cost of power and efficiency gains have yielded encouraging results.


    The Minister informed that as per the unaudited data submitted by States, the participating States have achieved an improvement of 1.07% in Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses and Rs.0.13 a Unit in Average Cost of Supply (ACS) - Average Revenue Realized (ARR) gaps in FY 2017. However, different states have different trajectories since they have joined UDAY at different time.


    Shri Goyal also stated that the participating states have already issued Bonds of approximately Rs.2.32 lakh crores, which addresses 86% of the debt envisaged in Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) executed under UDAY.
