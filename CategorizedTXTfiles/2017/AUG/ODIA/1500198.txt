      Posted On: 19 AUG 2017 3:29PM by PIB Bhubaneshwar


    The GST Implementation Committee, consisting of State and Central Government officers, has taken a decision to extend the last date for payment of the GST for the month of July 2017 to 25th August, 2017.


    Earlier the last date for payment of taxes and filing of GST Return in Form 3B for the month of July was kept as 20th of August 2017. Since it is the first Return to be filed under GST, the tax payers and the tax practitioners have requested for few more days to file their Return. Also there have been requests from States which are hit with floods to extend the last date for filing of GST Returns. The State of Jammu & Kashmir has also requested for extension of time because of late passing of their GST Ordinance. Some technical glitches are also experienced by last minute return filers.


    It has been specified that for those tax payers, who do not want to avail of transitional credit in TRANS1 this month, the date for return filing will be 25thAugust 2017. And for those who want to fill up TRANS1 this month, the last date for filing of returns will be 28th August 2017, as announced earlier. In order not to face any last moment technological difficulty in submission of return, all tax payers are requested to kindly file their return well before 25th / 28th of August 2017 and not wait for the last date. Suitable notification is being issued shortly.
