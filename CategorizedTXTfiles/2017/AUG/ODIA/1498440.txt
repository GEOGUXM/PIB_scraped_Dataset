    The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the construction of double line with electrification between Madurai-Vanchi and Maniyachchi-Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu.
    
    The total length of the line will be 160 km. The estimated cost of the Project will be Rs.1182.31 crore and completion cost of Rs.1272.51 crore with 5% escalation per annum.
    
    The project is likely to be completed in four years by 2020-21. The project will generate direct employment during construction for 38.40 lakh mandays.
    
    The project would not only speed up the operation of goods and coaching trains, but also provide additional capacity for meeting the increase in traffic in future.
    
    Background:
    
    Demands are being received for introduction of additional trains for this area to serve the local people, the ever increasing tourists desiring to visit the area and the traffic originating to/from Ports. Present Line Capacity utilisation of the section on trunk route is 106% which is likely to increase to 154% in next four years. This would cause detention to passenger and goods trains on trunk route and that originating to/from Tuticorin Port in future if double line is not provided on this 160 km section. Hence, doubling of Madurai-Vanchi Maniyachchi-Tuticorin with electrification needs to be taken up.
