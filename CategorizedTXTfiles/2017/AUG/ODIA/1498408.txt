      Posted On: 01 AUG 2017 6:50PM by PIB Bhubaneshwar


    The Government has further liberalized, simplified and rationalized the visa regime in India. E-visa scheme has been categorized into three sub-categories i.e. e-Tourist Visa, e-Business Visa and e-Medical Visa with increased number of entries and duration of stay. Further, long term Tourist visa is given for 5 years in respect of most of the countries of the world.


    Liberalized visa regime will result in higher number of foreigners visiting India which will give a boost to the tourism, medical and business sectors resulting in substantial increase in direct and indirect employment in these sectors.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question by Shri Venkatesh Babu T.G. in the Lok Sabha today.
