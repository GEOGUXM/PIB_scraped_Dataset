    Smt. Sharbati Devi, a 103 year old widow, today visited the PM's residence, and tied a Rakhi on Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi's wrist on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
    
    Smt. Sharbati Devi lost her brother about 50 years ago, and would always miss him, especially on Rakhi. Her son wrote to the Prime Minister and subsequently, the Prime Minister invited Smt. Sharbati Devi and her family to his residence today. Smt. Sharbati Devi was extremely delighted to meet the PM and tie a Rakhi. They had a wonderful interaction today.
