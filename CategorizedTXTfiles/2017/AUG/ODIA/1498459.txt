      Posted On: 02 AUG 2017 9:04PM by PIB Bhubaneshwar


    Ministry of Culture has recommended prohibition on use of polythene. Archaeological Survey of India has declared all ASI protected Monuments and Archaeological Sites as ‘Polythene Free Zone’. All the field offices of ASI have been directed for necessary compliance. In this regard Secretary (Culture) has also issued a D.O. letter to all the Chief Secretaries of States to elicit their active cooperation for making centrally protected monuments as polythene free zone.


    All the States and UT’s have been directed to issue necessary direction to local Municipal bodies and concerned Departments to keep the area 300 metres from the boundary of a protected monument as polythene free zone.


    This information was given by Dr. Mahesh Sharma, Minister of State for Culture and Tourism (Independent Charge) in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
