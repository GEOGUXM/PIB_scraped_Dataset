      Rehabilitation of Kashmiri Pandits
      Posted On: 01 AUG 2017 8:13PM by PIB Bhubaneshwar


    Due to onset of militancy in the State of Jammu and Kashmir during early 1990s, most of the Kashmiri Pandit families along with some other families migrated from Kashmir valley to Jammu, Delhi and other parts of the country. At present, there are about 62,000 registered Kashmiri migrant families in the country.


    The State Government of Jammu and Kashmir has informed that no cases of threat to Kashmiri Pandits living in the valley have been reported.


    The State government has allotted flats to 31 such Kashmiri Pandit families, who did not leave the valley during 1990s. These flats were constructed under the Scheme approved in 2008 by the Government of India for rehabilitation of Kashmiri migrants. Further, the Government of India has sanctioned a scheme on 4th December 2015 for providing 3000 additional State Government jobs to Kashmiri migrants and construction of 6000 transit accommodations in the Kashmir valley. The Kashmiri Pandit families who did not leave the Kashmir valley during the terrorist violence in the State of Jammu and Kashmir in early 1990s and who are still residing in the Kashmir valley are also eligible for the benefits under the scheme.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question by Shri Nana Patole in the Lok Sabha today.
