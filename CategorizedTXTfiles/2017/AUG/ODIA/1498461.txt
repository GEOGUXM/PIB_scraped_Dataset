      Posted On: 02 AUG 2017 9:07PM by PIB Bhubaneshwar


    Setting up of Border Haats is one of the methods for facilitating and increasing border trade across neighbouring countries.


    Currently four Border Haats are operational along India-Bangladesh border. Two Border Haats are located in Meghalaya at Kalaichar and Balat and two are located in Tripura at Srinagar and Kamalasagar. In addition to the four functional Border Haats, Government of India and Government of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of Bangladesh have agreed to set up six more border haats-two in Tripura and four in Meghalaya.


    Government of India has also executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Government of the Republic of Union of Myanmar under which Border Haats are to be set up at nine mutually agreed locations.


    This information was given by the Commerce and Industry Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today
