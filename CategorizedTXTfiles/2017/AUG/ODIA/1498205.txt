    The Government has amended the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 vide G.S.R. 629(E) dated 23 June, 2017 and incorporated a new provision under Rule 6(1) as follows:


    “6(1)(da) If a package contains a commodity which may become unfit for human consumption after a period of time, the ‘best before or use by the date, month and year’ shall also be mentioned on the label:


    Provided that nothing in this clause shall apply if a provision in this regard is made in any other law.”


    The facility of ‘e-code’ for net quantity assurance of the commodity and other required declarations is proposed to be given to the industries to ensure that the commodity is correct in quantity and declarations, which is optional and not mandatory.


    The e-commerce companies are required to ensure that the mandatory declarations are displayed on the digital and electronic network used for e-commerce transactions viz. Name and address of the manufacturer/ packer/ Importer, Name of the Commodity, Net quantity, Retail sale price in the form MRP (inclusive of all taxes) and consumer care details.

    For the violation of these Rules, the penalty provisions are made under section 36 of the Legal Metrology Act, 2009.
