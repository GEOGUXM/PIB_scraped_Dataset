    A group of 65 State Civil Service Officers promoted to the IAS and attending the 119th Induction Training Programme at Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind today (August 4, 2017) at Rashtrapati Bhavan.


    Addressing the Civil Service Officers, the President said that the Induction Training Programme is an important milestone as they enter a new phase in their careers. He stated that we have to be mindful of the expectations of our young population, and of the poor and marginalised sections of our society. We cannot ignore that there are often legitimate questions that are asked about the quality of our governance systems and our bureaucratic mechanism.


    The President said that the most important challenge before the Civil Service Officers is to give confidence to the people of India – the people they are mandated to serve – that civil servants are fair, honest, professional and efficient. As public servants, they need to be role models in their personal conduct. In their professional conduct, honesty and integrity, humility, and sensitivity to the diversity of India and of our society are non-negotiable.
