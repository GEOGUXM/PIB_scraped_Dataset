The Minister will also release a project report on Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases in Kerala completed by SCTIMST in collaboration with the Kerala State Health Services Department.


    SreeChitra Institute President Shri. KM Chandrasekhar will preside over the function. SCTIMST director Prof. Asha Kishor will hand over the project report. Dr. B. Ekbal-Kerala State planning board member, Dr. R.L Sarita-Director of Health Services, Kerala, Shri.

    The Comprehensive Care Centre for Neurodevelopmetal disorders will focus on the diagnosis, evaluation, treatment and rehabilitation of children with autism spectrum disorders and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Multi-disciplinary services will be offered by a dedicated team consisting of a neurologist, speech and language pathologist, psychologist, occupational therapist and physiotherapist.


    The Minister will also release the project report on Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases in Kerala completed on collaboration with state Health Services Department. The survey followed the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended methodology for NCD risk factor surveillance. According to the survey


    In adults over 18 years of age in Kerala:


    • on an average nearly one out of three has hypertension and one out of five has diabetes, respectively;


    • awareness, treatment and control status of both hypertension and diabetes are alarmingly low even in the relatively better educated Kerala population: only 13% and 16% of the individuals with diagnosed hypertension and diabetes achieved adequate blood pressure and blood sugar control status;


    • one out of four adult males reported current use of some form of tobacco and over 30% reported current alcohol use.


    • among adults in the age group of 45-69 years, over two third of the population (67.7%) is either diabetic or pre-diabetic.


    • almost 9 of ten participants (86%) reported consumption of less than two servings of fruits per day.


    Context specific, resource sensitive and scalable intervention strategies need to be developed and implemented in Kerala.


    There is reversal of social gradient for diabetes with higher prevalence in low educated group as compared to individuals with more than high school level education. This puts a disproportionate burden of care on poor families. Our data strongly argue for universal health care with provisions for appropriate management of diabetes and hypertension at the primary care level in Kerala.
