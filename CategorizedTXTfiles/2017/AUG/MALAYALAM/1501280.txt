    The Annual Training Conference (ATC) and Annual Training Meeting (ATM) of Indian Navy were held on 29 Aug 17 at naval base, Kochi. Both the events were chaired by the Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Southern Naval Command (SNC), Vice Admiral AR Karve, AVSM . During the event all agencies involved in the training of officers and men in the navy reviewed the ever-changing complexities of the maritime environment in India's neighbourhood in the recent past, and whether any realignment was needed in "training" to meet the operational challenges posed by it.


    On this occasion, the SNC ‘Gyan Praveen’ Trophy for the Best Training Package was also awarded to INS Valsura, the technical training unit of the navy at Jamnagar, Gujarat, for its audio-visual training package on Hydraulic Engineering which was followed by release of the second edition of the Southern Naval Command five yearly archival publication “TIMELINE” by the Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, covering activities of all units under SNC for the period 2011 – 2015. The two events were graced by the physical presence of senior officers of SNC as well as the heads of all training units under it besides the video presence of other senior officers such as Vice Admiral Anil Chawla, the Chief of Personnel from Naval Headquarters, New Delhi.


    SNC as the Training Command of the Indian Navy is responsible for the organisation, conduct and oversight of all basic, professional and specialist training in the Navy. To enable this, the Command continuously evolves policies, formulates syllabi and reviews and restructures the scope of training in various schools and establishments. The Command also coordinates, monitors and controls the day-to-day training activities of the schools and establishments and conducts numerous watermanship, adventure and sports activities.


    ATC and ATM are held once in a year to take stock of the Indian Navy’s training efforts and initiatives and make course corrections, if required.
