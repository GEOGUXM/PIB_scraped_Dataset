    The Ministry of Women and Child Development has developed a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for tracing of missing children. The SOP for tracing of missing children is in consonance with the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules 2016 framed under Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children), Act, 2015. The SOP mainly deals with the tracking of missing children and their rehabilitation after recovery. It defines roles and responsibilities of various stake holders such as Police, Child Welfare Committees, Juvenile Justice Board, etc. This may be used by all States/UTs to deal with cases of missing children and to follow a uniform procedure throughout the country. The SOP provides a set of comprehensive standard operating procedure for key stakeholders involved in child tracing, family tracing, repatriation, rehabilitation, social reintegration and preventive work.
