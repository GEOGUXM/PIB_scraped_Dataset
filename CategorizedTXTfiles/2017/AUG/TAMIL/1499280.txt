    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today appreciated Vice President Shri Hamid Ansari, saying that it reflects his skill, patience and intellect, to be able to function as Chairman of the Rajya Sabha for 10 years, where one has to be calm in all situations.
    
    Speaking at the farewell function in Parliament for Shri Hamid Ansari, the Prime Minister said that the long public life of Shri Ansari has been without any controversy.
    
    The Prime Minister said that Shri Ansari's family has been in public life for generations. He particularly recalled Brigadier Usman, who had embraced martyrdom defending the nation in 1948.
    
    The Prime Minister suggested that Shri Ansari, with his long experience of running the Rajya Sabha, should pen down his thoughts on how the functioning of the Upper House can be made more effective.
