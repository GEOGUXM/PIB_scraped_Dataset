Background                :  The Jaunpur-Akbarpur section falls in Lucknow Division of Northern Railways. At present detention of trains in Jaunpur-Akbarpur is high (140 minutes) as 31 trains are running on single line section. Present capacity utilization is 133%. Also 14 more freight trains are expected each day with augmentation of National Thermal Power Corporation plant at Tanda by January, 2019.Doubling is absolutely necessary and it would not only speed up operation of goods and passenger trains but will also provide additional capacity for meeting the increased traffic in future.

Background                :  The project section is a part of Malda-Guwahati Main line route. For the route connecting to North East region this is the only 51 km patch left for doubling and it is necessary for overall development of the region and to reap the benefits of other doubling projects and gauge conversion projects completed in the section. The line capacity utilization of the section between Raninagar Jalpaiguri to Samuktala Road is 145.70% with maintenance block during 2016-17. At present, 38 trains are running against the sectional capacity of 22 trains.

Background                :  This flyover will help in avoiding surface crossing on busy Delhi Howrah route and will help in reducing detentions and removing bottlenecks. Trains coming from Gwalior/Agra to Etawah will move via flyover over UP & DN lines. Trains from Gwalior/Agra and going to Mainpuri will move via flyover and branch off to Mainpuri. Trains coming from Etawah and going to Mainpuri will move via flyover, over the UP & DN main lines. This flyover at Etawah will help in improving punctuality of passenger trains and smooth running of the routes i.e. Howrah- Kanpur-New Delhi, Etawah –Bhind & Agra and Etawah- Mainpuri.
