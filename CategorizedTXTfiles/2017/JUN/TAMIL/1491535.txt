      Posted On: 01 JUN 2017 4:34PM by PIB Chennai


    It has come to the notice of Ministry of Women & Child Development (MWCD), Government of India that certain unauthorized sites/organizations/ NGOs/individuals are distributing illegal forms in the name of cash incentive under Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme. The scheme has no provision for individual CASH TRANSFER COMPONENT by Government of India. Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme focuses on challenging mindsets and deep rooted patriarchy in the societal system, strict enforcement of PC&PNDT Act, advancing education of the girl child: focus is on issues of women empowerment on a life cycle continuum. It is not a DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) scheme.
    
    The Ministry of Women & Child Development has taken up this matter with the State Government Authorities where this illegal activity has taken place namely, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal. The warning has been broadcast several times by this Ministry on print media as well as electronic media to this effect. The Ministry had advised that no personal details should be shared in this regard and no one should subscribe to such fraudulent scheme.However, still some people are falling prey to such frauds and paying money or disclose personal details in name of such non-existent benefit being falsely offered in the name of BBBP scheme. The general public is therefore, once again advised not to fall prey into this fake and fraudulent information.
