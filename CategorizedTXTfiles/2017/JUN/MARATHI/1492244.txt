People in the organisation has to take a decision of change. Organisational change can happen only if the shortcomings are realised. Railways is a complex organization. It has commercial role, social role and welfare role and has to meet expectations of people which are unique and conflicting. It also has to play a role of national transporter. Railways is the most important strategic asset of country. It is important for economic, social aspect which cannot be overlooked. Organisation must constantly revisit its objective and try to cater to the needs of people. For development of Railways, people in the organisation should be created to face the challenges. Railways need to clearly define the corporate goals, it should create the organised structure then it should place the right people in the organisation. The change should start from the top level so it should be discernible to the people. Railways as an organisation should cater to the larger corporate goals, corporate goals should cater to societal priorities. The action & attention should be at Divisional level, Railway Divisions as a business unit should be a focal point of the changes.
