    Union Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports shri Vijay Goel has congratulated Shrikanth Kidambi on winning the Australian Open Badminton Super Series. In a message Shri Goel said, “Srikanth’s performance has been truly exceptional and his recent wins have made the nation proud. I shall be delighted to meet and honour him very soon. We are committed towards development of every game and our Sports Ministry along with SAI will provide complete support to all players and support staff”.
    
    Shri Goel also reiterated that his Ministry’s doors are open 24x7 to provide help, support and best facilities to our sportspersons. India has been doing well in the field of sports; from securing a place in the top 100 of the FIFA ranking in football, to winning the Kabaddi World Cup 2016 and even the Asian Hockey Champions Trophy victory in both men’s and women’s category last year. Goel stated that not only cricket but we must provide support and encouragement to indigenous games like kabaddi and wrestling etc.
    
    The Sports Ministry has taken various initiatives to engage the youth in sporting activities like Slum Youth Marathon, Khelo India etc. “Not just cricket but in football, hockey, kabaddi and even motorsports, India seems to be on the winning path and the future looks great”, shri Goel added. The Minister said that the idea is to create sports culture and buzz across India that will surely help us find talented young ones and train them for the future.
