Moreover, the eligible allottees can avail Interest Subsidy of Rs.1.40 lakh to Rs.2.67 lakh under the Credit Linked Subsidy component of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban).


        The houses on offer on ‘free hold basis’ are located at Dwarka, Rohini, Pitampura, Paschim Vihar, Janakpuri, Vasant Kunj, Narela, Jasola, Siraspura etc. Most of these are constructed as per Green Building Norms reducing the Carbon footprint.
