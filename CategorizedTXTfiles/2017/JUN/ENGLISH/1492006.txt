INSV Tarini is 55 feet in length and built in India in line with the ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Indian Navy, fructified by M/s Aquarius Shipyard, Goa.


      The Vessel is skippered by Lieutenant Commander Vartika Joshi (a Naval Architect) and the all-women Naval officers crew comprising Lieutenant Commander Pratibha Jamwal, Lieutenants P Swathi, Vijaya Devi, Payal Gupta and B Aishwarya. Tarini has begun a new chapter in the history of ocean sailing by Indian women, wherein the first Indian all-women crew of IN would endeavour to circumnavigate the globe in Aug 2017. Tarini aims to promote a spirit of adventure and camaraderie amongst the young Naval personnel in the years ahead.
