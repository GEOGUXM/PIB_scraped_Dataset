During one of the stakeholder consultations, it was announced that an effort will be made to release the mid-term review before 01st July, 2017 to align this with the roll out of GST.


    Number of representations have been received from the exporters regarding GST. Accordingly, it has been decided to release the reviewed Foreign Trade Policy in September 2017. This will allow the government to factor in the exportersâ€™ feedback on relevant issues post GST.
