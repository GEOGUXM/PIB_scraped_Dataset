        As of today, all the States and Union Territories (having assemblies), except the State of Jammu & Kashmir, have approved the State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) Act. The State of Kerala issued an Ordinance today approving State GST Act while the State of West Bengal had issued an Ordinance in this regard on 15 th June, 2017. Now only one State is left i.e. the State of J&K which is yet to pass the State GST Act. Thus, almost the entire country including all the 30 States/UTs are now on board and ready for the smooth roll-out of GST with effect from 1 st July, 2017.


        The details of the States which have passed the State GST Act till today are as follows:
