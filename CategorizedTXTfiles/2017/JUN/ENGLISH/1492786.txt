    A group of probationers of Railway Protection Force called on the President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee today (June 14, 2017) at Rashtrapati Bhavan.
    
    Speaking on the occasion, the President congratulated the probationers for qualifying one of the most difficult competitive examinations and committing themselves to public service. He said that it is a matter of satisfaction that after having acquired high qualifications from prestigious institutions, they had decided to serve the people of India.
    
    The President said that Indian Railways is one of the largest railway networks in the world. He said that the career which the probationers had chosen in the Railway Protection Force is not only very challenging but will also offer them immense opportunities to develop innovative means for safety and security of passengers in the mammoth apparatus of Railways. He urged them to remember that while protecting railway property and ensuring the security of passengers, the railway officers were just not rendering a very important public utility service but also uniting and binding different parts of a diverse nation. He said that Railways can be termed as the lifeline of the economy. The transportation of goods, services and passengers from one place to another is not merely in physical terms but also links the people of the country together.
