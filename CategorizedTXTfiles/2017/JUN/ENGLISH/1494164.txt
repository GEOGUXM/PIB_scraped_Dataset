    Secretary (Personnel) Shri BP Sharma dedicated compost bins in the premises of the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) here today, on the concluding day of the Swachhta Pakhwada. Five numbers of compost bins (earthen pots) have been installed in DoPT canteen in the North Block premises.


    The compost bins utilise the disposed organic vegetable waste/garbage of canteen kitchen and convert it into organic manure through decomposition process. The process of making manure is natural as well as economical and cost effective.


    Speaking on the occasion Shri Sharma said the Department is exploring the possibility of utilisation of the kitchen based waste material on wider scale considering the large volume of organic waste output generated from the canteen.


    Shri Sharma also dedicated 10 numbers of Blue and Green coloured dustbins due to be placed at various places in DoPT for the proper waste management. The Blue container is for wet waste materials and the Green container is for dry waste materials.


    Department of Personnel and Training is carrying out various activities under the Swachhta Pakhwada (June 16-30, 2017) allocated to it by Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation. Various Swachhta related activities were undertaken by the Department during the past fortnight. All the officers and employees of DoPT participated enthusiastically in the various activities under Swachhta Pakhwada.
