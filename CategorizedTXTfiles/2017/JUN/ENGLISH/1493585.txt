        Crude Oil


        1. Crude oil production during May, 2017 was 3099.48 TMT which is 0.35% lower than target but 0.73 % higher when compared with May 2016.Cumulative crude oil production during April-May, 2017 was 6038.33 TMT which is 1.16% lower than target for the period but 0.07% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise and state-wise crude oil production is given at Annexure-I. Unit-wise crude oil production for the month of May, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April-May, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-1 and month-wise in Figure-1.

        Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


        Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall have been given in following sub-sections:


        1.1 Crude oil production by ONGC during May, 2017 was 1934.59 TMT which is 0.98% higher than the monthly target and 2.52% higher when compared with May, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-May, 2017 was 3781.75 TMT which is 0.54% higher than target for the period and 2.51% higher than production during corresponding period of last year.


        1.2 Crude oil production by OIL during May, 2017 was 287.91 TMT which is 1.31% lower than monthly target but 6.08% higher than production in May, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-May, 2017 was 561.15 TMT which is 1.85% lower than target for the period but 5.32% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


        · Less than planned contribution from high producing areas like Greater Hapjan, Shalmari, Chandmari and Moran fields primarily on account of rise in water cut.


        · Less than planned contribution from new drilling wells and work over wells.


        1.3 Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during May, 2017 was 876.98 TMT which is 2.85%lower than the monthly target and 4.53% lower than May, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-May, 2017 was 1695.43 TMT which is 4.55% lower than target for the period and 6.46% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


        · RJ-ON-90/1: Around 100 wells are closed either due to high water cut or require WOJ and poor reservoir performance of Bhagyam.


        · Panna-Mukta: MB, MA wells closed for riser line pigging on 13-14.05.2017 and PH-3, PB-2,6& PE-3 underperformance.


        · Natural Decline in Ravva.


        · CY-ONN-2002/2: Test production from 5 oil wells. PML not yet granted.


        · CB-ONN-2004/2: Underperformance of wells.


        Natural Gas


        2 Natural gas production during May, 2017 was 2768.89 MMSCM which is 5.19% lower than the target for the month but4.16% higher when compared with May, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production during April-May, 2017 was 5302.50 MMSCM which is 7.13% lower than target for the period but 3.04% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II. Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of May, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April-May, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

        Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production


        2.1 Natural gas production by ONGC during May, 2017 was 1963.62 MMSCM which is 1.69% lower than the monthly target but 9.52% higher when compared with May, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC during April-May, 2017 was 3754.60 MMSCM which is 3.64% lower than the cumulative target but 9.66% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


        · Less production from C 24 cluster, C-26 cluster and Daman due to closure of wells for carrying out repair job in line from TPP Process Complex to South Bassein Heera Trunk Line (SBHT).


        2.2 Natural gas production by OIL during May, 2017 was 244.89 MMSCM which is 3.27% lower than the monthly target but 2.41% higher than May, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-May, 2017 was 486.17 MMSCM which is 2.12% lower than the cumulative target and 0.67% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year.


        2.3 Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during May, 2017 was 560.35 MMSCM which is 16.35% lower than the monthly target and 10.52% lower when compared with May, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-May, 2017 was 1061.74 MMSCM which is 19.34% lower than the cumulative target and 13.89% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


        · Underperformance of wells in KG- OSN-2001/3


        · Underperformance of Sohagpur West CBM block, few wells closed for planned maintenance & refrac job in Raniganj East CBM block.


        · AAP-ON-94/1 (HOEC): Production deferred due to delay in grant of PML.


        · Closure of 2 wells in D1D3 field in KG-DWN-98/3.


        Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)

        Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production


        3.1 CPSE Refineries’ production during May, 2017 was 12453.04TMT which is 5.83% higher than the target for the month and 7.62% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-May, 2017 was 23606.80 TMT which is 2.76% higher than the target for the period and 3.96% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


        · IOCL, Barauni: Lower due to Naphtha containment and switchover to BS-IV fuel.


        · IOCL, Gujarat: Lower due to BS-IV switchover and to facilitate ISD depletion before M&I S/D.


        · IOCL, Haldia: Lower due to High VGO stock.


        · IOCL, Bongaigaon: Lower due to High DHDT intermediate Stock.


        · CPCL, Manali: Lower than target due to CDU-3/HGU/OHCU shutdown (equipment problem).


        · CPCL, CBR: Lower than target due to product upliftment constraints.


        · MRPL, Mangalore: Crude reduced due to Crude Vessel (VLCC) arrival delayed by 4 days and turnaround shutdown job advanced by 2 days.


        3.2 Production in JV refineries during May, 2017 was 635.49 TMT which is 21.05% higher than the target for the month but 59.31% lower than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-May, 2017 was 2007.93 TMT which is 13.83% higher than the target for the period but 33.41% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. The major reason for shortfall in production was major turnaround underway in HMEL refinery during April - June, 2017.


        3.3 Production in private refineries during May, 2017 was 7738.20TMT which is 15.21% higher than the target for the month and 13.51% higher when compared with May, 2016. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-May, 2017 was 15225.85 TMT which is 6.92% higher than the target for the period and 5.86% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year.


        3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of May, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April-May, 2017 vis-à-vis April-May, 2016 are given at Annexures - IV and V respectively.
