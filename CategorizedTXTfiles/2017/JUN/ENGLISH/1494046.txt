    The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation released the report titled “ Key Indicators of Unincorporated Non-Agricultural Enterprises (Excluding Construction) in India’ based on the information collected under 73 rd round of its survey conducted during July, 2015 to June, 2016 as a follow-up survey of the 6 th Economic Census. Similar survey on the same subject was earlier conducted by NSSO during July 2010- June 2011 as part of NSS 67 th Round.


    2. The survey was designed to generate various estimates on the operational and economic characteristics of the unincorporated non-agricultural enterprises in industry sectors of manufacturing, trading and other services (excluding construction) such as their type of ownership, type of enterprises, employment particulars, operating expenses & receipts, Gross Value Added, indebtedness, etc. The survey covered non-agricultural enterprises which are not incorporated (i.e. not registered under Companies Act, 1956). The categories of enterprises under the coverage of survey included, proprietary and partnership enterprises (excluding limited liability partnerships), Self Help Groups (SHGs), Non-Profit Institutions (NPIs) and Trusts etc. The domain of ‘unincorporated enterprises’ excluded (a) enterprises registered under Sections 2m(i) and 2m(ii) of the Factories Act, 1948 or bidi and cigar manufacturing enterprises registered under Bidi and Cigar Workers (Condition of Employment) Act, 1966, (b) government/public sector enterprises and (c) cooperatives.


    3. The survey would provide much needed information to the planners and policy makers on the unincorporated non-agricultural sector for targeted planning and policy formulation. The survey would also generate estimates at a disaggregated activity category level as required by Central Statistics Office (CSO).


    4. The survey covered the whole of the Indian Union.
