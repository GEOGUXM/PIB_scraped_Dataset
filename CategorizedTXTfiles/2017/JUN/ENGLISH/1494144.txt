He stated that almost a century ago, J.C. Bose, dedicated this Institute, the first of its kind in the country fully devoted towards scientific research, to the service of the nation. Today, with the inauguration of this new campus, Bose Institute is embarking upon a fresh phase in its journey, more so befitting as the Institute celebrates its Centenary this year. The President said he was informed that a series of international conferences, visits and lectures by eminent scientists including Nobel laureates are planned to celebrate this milestone.
