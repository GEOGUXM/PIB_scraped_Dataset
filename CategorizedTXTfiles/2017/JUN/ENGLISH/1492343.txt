      The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee has extended his greetings and felicitations to the Government and people of the Portuguese Republic on the eve of their National Day (June 10, 2017).
      
      In a message to His Excellency Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, the President of the Portuguese Republic, the President has said, “On behalf of the Government, the people of India and on my own behalf, it gives me great pleasure to extend warm greetings and felicitations to you and to the people of Portugal on the occasion of your National Day.
      
      India and Portugal enjoy warm and friendly relations, anchored in historical and cultural links. Our bilateral ties have been energized following the recent visit of Prime Minister Antonio Costa to India in January this year. We hope that our two counties will work closely to build further on this renewed momentum in our bilateral relations.
      
      Please accept, Excellency, my best wishes for your good health and personal well-being as well as for the progress and prosperity of the friendly people of Portugal”.
