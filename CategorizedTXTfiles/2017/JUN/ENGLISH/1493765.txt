    Union Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Vijay Goel here today flagged off 2nd Slum Yuva Daud. The marathon started from Cross River Mall, Karkardooma and ended at Yamuna Sports Complex. More than 5000 youth participated in today’s marathon. BJP National General Secretary Arun Singh also graced the occasion. The Slum Yuva Daud is part of the Adopt Slum Campaign initiated by the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports and Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan.
    
    Shri Goel said, government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always encouraged young players to utilize their skills in sports and shine. He said, these events enable us to gather the youth and know about their skills and ideas. We would organize mini-fests in slums with the themes of Swachhta, Digital India, Beti Bachao Beti Padao etc. He said, Government aims at creating model slums and create groups of youth who will work as agents of change to work for the development of their respective slums/areas.
    
    The Slum Yuva Daud and Adopt a Slum campaign aim at highlighting the government’s pro-people schemes among masses. Goel further stated that the “Adopt a Slum” campaign will involve groups like NSS, public schools, RWAs, NGOs and rotary clubs etc.
    
    The third mega slum youth marathon will take place on tomorrow from Kasturba Gandhi polytechnic (Pitampura) where renowned wrestler and two-time Olympic medalist Sushil Kumar will join the flag off ceremony with Sports Minister Goel.
