    This Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said that GST midnight rollout heralds the dawn of cooperative federalism, at an interactive programme of Healthcare Leaders’ here today.

    
    Dr Jitendra Singh said that the midnight of June 30 and July 1 will go down in the history of India as a reform which was initially envisaged with the prime objective of changing India’s fortunes but eventually ended up in changing the entire work culture in Governance and the behavior pattern in society. He said that GST will also be remembered as the independent India’s most meticulously and most diligently worked out reform, for which the Union Minister for Finance Shri Arun Jaitley spent hundreds of hours finalising details and presided over as many as 18 long brainstorming meetings of the GST Council.
    
    In the course of developing the GST draft, Dr Jitendra Singh said that many of us may not have fully realized that we were also developing a new kind of work culture in the Government. Every decision in the GST Council, he pointed out, was taken with absolute unanimity with 3/4th majority, in which 2/3rd representation was from the States. In other words, he said that this is for the first time that a major decision in the Government has been taken with the spirit of absolute federalism with full cooperation of all the States and Union Territories of the Union.
