    In a noble and humane gesture, elder citizens from among the pensioners donated fund for military and paramilitary martyrs to Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh.
    
    Led by Secretary General of "Bharat Pensioners Samaj", Shri S.C. Maheshwari, the senior, superannuated citizens met Dr Jitendra Singh here yesterday and handed over to him a cheque of the amount collected by them through donations by different pensioners. They said, they were contributing this amount to the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund for the specific purpose of welfare and care of the families of the martyrs from the military and paramilitary forces, who were sacrificing their lives in anti-terrorist operations.
    
    The letter accompanying the cheque stated that “Bharat Pensioners Samaj”, a conglomerate of 725 pensioners associations, reiterates its resolve to stand solidly behind the government and urges that those who insult our men in uniform or hamper the army operations against terrorists, should be dealt with an iron hand.
    
    Appreciating the gesture, Dr Jitendra Singh said, regardless of the amount donated by the senior citizens, the matter of fact is that the value of the amount is many times more than it appears to be, for the simple reason that it has been collected with a sense of impeccable patriotism and it has been contributed from the most hard-earned pension drawn by some of our senior citizens.
    
    Dr Jitendra Singh said, we are proud of the Indian Army which is among the best forces in the world and we are also eternally indebted to the supreme sacrifices made by our army personnel. The sacrifices of a soldier, he said, cannot be compensated by any amount of money, but yet, a gesture like this is only meant to reaffirm our commitment to the motherland and to those bravehearts who laid down their lives so that we could live.
