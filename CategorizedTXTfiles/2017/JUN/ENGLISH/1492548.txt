        Ministry of Defence website ( www.mod.nic.in ) has migrated to the new Content Management Framework (CMF) as per the Guidelines for India Government Websites (GIGW). The new website will be dynamic in nature.


        The new website would not only be user but also gadget friendly, catering to diverse needs of different sections of people, including the differently abled.


        The salient features of CMF are: it standardises government websites complying with GIGW Guidelines; accommodates users with special needs, especially hearing and visual; improves presentation by giving it a contemporary look and feel; and enhances content delivery through availability of responsive interface over a wide range of devices, including smart phones and tablets.
