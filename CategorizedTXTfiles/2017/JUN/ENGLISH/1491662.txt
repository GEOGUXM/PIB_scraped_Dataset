    The Secretary Mines Shri Arun Kumar chaired a meeting of the Coordination- Cum- Empowered Committee (CCEC) of the major mineral producing states in New Delhi today. Representatives from seventeen states were present in the meeting. The discussion mainly focussed on the statesâ€™ preparedness for e-auction of mineral blocks for 2017-18. The seven states informed the Secretary Mines, that as many as 71 blocks have been identified for e-auctioning during the remaining part of year 2017-18.
    
    These blocks include 6 blocks (2 Gold, 4 cement grade Limestone) in Andhra Pradesh, 11 blocks (4 Bauxite, 7 Limestone) in Chhattisgarh, 12 blocks (3 Bauxite, 9 Limestone) in Gujarat, 9 blocks (1 Bauxite, 3 Limestone,1 Gold, 1 Graphite, 2 Emerald, 1 Iron Ore) in Jharkhand, 18 blocks (4 Bauxite, 7 Limestone,1 Gold, 1 Graphite, 2 Manganese, 2 Iron Ore, 2 Copper) in Maharashtra, 7 blocks (1 Limestone,1 Graphite, 5 Iron Ore) in Odisha and 8 blocks (7 Limestone, 1 Copper) in Rajasthan.
    
    The Secretary Mines Shri Arun Kumar addressing the CCEC meeting, asked the States to expedite and monitor the auctions, as recently a large number of leases have elapsed due to the section 10A(2)(c) of the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act 1957, which should now come up for auction route only. He further said that as a large number of merchant mining leases will come up for auction on 31.3.2020, the States need to prepare their plans in advance latest by September this year and share it with Mines Ministry so that production slack can be met and the supply of essential minerals and iron ore remain smooth. He said, the auctions conducted so far will fetch Rs. 85250 crores to States of which the additional contribution due to auction is Rs. 67,501 crores over the licence period of 50 years. Just 4 States constitute 90 % of this takeaway and other states need to expedite their mining auctions.
    
    The CCEC meeting also discussed other key issues of the mining sector like Minor Mineral Rules, Status of project implementation under Pradhan Mantri Khanij Kshetra Kalyan Yojana (PMKKKY) and the creation of District Mineral Foundation (DMF) after the MMDR Amendment Act with effect from 12 Jan 2015 to address the development goals of the people affected by mining. The meeting also reviewed the progress in Mining Tenement System (MTS) implementation, Mining Surveillance System (MSS), Star rating of mines, and the action plan for auctioning the mining leases expiring in March 2020.
