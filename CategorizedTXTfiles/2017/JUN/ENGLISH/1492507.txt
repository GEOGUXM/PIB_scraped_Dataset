    The Union Minister for Urban Development, Housing, Urban Poverty Alleviation & Information and Broadcasting Sri M.Venkaiah Naidu has deeply condoled the sad demise of the Gyanpeeth awardee and former Rajya Sabha Member Dr. C Narayan Reddy in Hyderabad. In a condolence message Sri Naidu said that Dr Reddy was a great literary figure in Telugu literature. He was “king of the king” in Telugu language and a wonderful poet. His writings had mesmerized the people at large. He had a great passion for literature, culture and art.


    Union Minister Sri Naidu said his demise is not only a loss to Telugu literature, it is a loss to Indian literature also. His invaluable contribution will be remembered for ever. As a parliamentarian, Dr. Reddy gave many constructive suggestions in Rajya Sabha. I condole the passing away of Dr. C. Narayan Reddy and pray for his bereaved family.
