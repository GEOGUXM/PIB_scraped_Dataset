    A group of Officer Trainees of the 2016 batch of the Indian Foreign Service called on the President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee today (June 1, 2017) at Rashtrapati Bhavan.
    
    Addressing the Officer Trainees, the President congratulated them for choosing the Civil Services as a career. He said that as they had chosen to serve their country as its diplomatic representatives it was important for them to remember that it was India that brought the gift of the greatest concept of universal acceptance to the world; it gave the slogan of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam to humanity. He stated that the Foreign Service offers them the unique opportunity and privilege to represent the country and project its civilizational and cultural heritage and interact with counterparts the world over – for achieving her developmental goals.
    
    The President said that a diplomat is required to always be well informed on the widest range of relevant subjects. He or she needs to have a thorough knowledge of the economic and social dynamics of their country and also remain aware and alert about the areas in which India could engage with other countries for the benefit of its people.
    
    The President said that it is important to cultivate a deep interest and understanding of the countries where they are posted in order to explore all opportunities for strengthening India’s bilateral relations with its Government and people. He said that they must always remember that they are representatives of India, one of the oldest civilizations of the world which taught people how to live together, develop together and advance together.
