    Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Prime Minister Antonio Costa today jointly visited the Champalimaud Foundation in Lisbon.

    
    The Champalimaud Foundation is a private biomedical research foundation. It provides cutting-edge cancer treatment, and supports "ahead of the curve" cancer research. It offers a new holistic approach to medical care, that integrates day to day treatment with research and innovation in a green environment, closely linked to nature.
    
    The Centre's design, which features a tropical garden, views to the river and sea, and plenty of sunlight, was designed by one of India's most eminent architects: Charles Correa.
    
    The Foundation represents multiple synergies between India and Portugal.
    
    It is an institution dedicated to cancer research and treatment, underlined by the principle of holistic health that Prime Minister Modi has often emphasized. Cancer patients undergo a unique methodology in which they are connected to nature even as they go advanced medical treatments including chemotherapy.
    
    The Ant√≥nio Champalimaud Vision Award was established in 2007 to recognise contributions to research into eyecare and vision. Aravind Eye Care System, an Indian organisation, won the award in the first year.
    
    Out of the 300 researchers from 42 nations, 3 researchers at the Foundation represent India.
    
    Champalimaud Foundation has a tie-up with the Prasad Institute in Hyderabad. The largest number of overseas patients for cancer treatment in Champalimaud Foundation are from India.
    
    The Prime Minister visited the facilities at the Foundation, and interacted briefly with Indian researchers.
