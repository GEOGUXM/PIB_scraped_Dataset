    An unforeseen situation has developed at Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), Sheva owing to disruption in the operations of one of the private terminal operator, APM Maersk at JNPT. It has been informed by the private Terminal Operator that this disruption is a consequence of a worldwide disruption being faced by them because of a cyber attack. While the Terminal Operator is taking steps to address the issues disrupting the operations, it is anticipated that there could be bunching of in-bound and out-bound container cargo. Ministry of Shipping and JNPT are alive to the situation and are taking steps to ensure minimum disturbance to trade, transporters and more importantly local citizens. Since the congestion could create difficulties in traffic management, JNPT has opened up its parking lots for cargo destined to this private terminal. Further, CFSs have been advised to hold the cargo in their yards. JNPT is also working with local authority CIDCO, to identify more parking areas. Traffic control teams are being deployed to address potential road congestion.


    The situation is being closely monitored and further steps to deal with the traffic situation will be initiated based on an assessment during the course of the next few days. Dr. Gulshan Rai, National Cyber Security Coordinator is proceeding to JNPT to further deal with the situation.
