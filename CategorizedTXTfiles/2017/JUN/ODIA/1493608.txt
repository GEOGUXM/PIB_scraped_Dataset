      Posted On: 18 JUN 2017 8:56PM by PIB Bhubaneshwar


    With the objective of ensuring smooth rollout of GST and taking into account the concerns expressed by the trade and industry regarding filing of the returns in GST regime, it has been decided that, for the first two months of GST implementation, the tax would be payable based on a simple return (Form GSTR-3B) containing summary of outward and inward supplies which will be submitted before 20 th of the succeeding month. However, the invoice-wise details in regular GSTR – 1 would have to be filed for the month of July and August, 2017 as per the timelines given below –

                                                                                             
Month         GSTR – 3B        GSTR - 1                 GSTR – 2 (auto populated from GSTR-1)

August, 2017  20 th September  16 th – 20 th September  21 st – 25 th September              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             

    * Facility for uploading of outward supplies for July, 2017 will be available from 15 th July, 2017.


    No late fees and penalty would be levied for the interim period. This is intended to provide a sense of comfort to the taxpayers and give them an elbow room to attune themselves with the requirements of the changed system. This not only underlines the government’s commitment towards ensuring that all the stakeholders are on board but also provides an opportunity to the taxpayers to be ready for this historic reform.
