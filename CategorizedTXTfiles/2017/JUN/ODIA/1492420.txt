    The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the following:


    (i) Taking over Dr. B. Borooah Cancer Institute, Guwahati by Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and bringing it under the administrative control of Tata Memorial Centre, an Aided institution of DAE;


    (ii) Augmentation of additional manpower of 166 posts in medical, paramedical and support positions.


    The decision comes in the wake of the increasing instances of cancer, limited cancer treatment facilities and the need for a hospital support to carry out further research in North Eastern Region.


    The approximate non-recurring expenditure for strengthening of institute is estimated at Rs. 150 crore and annual recurring expenditure is estimated at Rs. 45- 50 crore.


    Background:


    Borooah Cancer Institute was established in 1974 in Guwahati with the aim and objective of investigation, diagnosis and treatment of cancer in the North Eastern region of India by a voluntary organization. Government of Assam took over the institute with all its assets and liabilities in 1986 and entered into a tripartite agreement with the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and North Eastern Council for management of the institute. The institute is presently a 209 bedded hospital with 8 bedded ICU.


    Tata Memorial hospital under DAE is a premier research institution in the field of cancer research and treatment. TMC under the aegis of DAE has been extending financial and technical support to the institute since 1989. Chief Minister of Assam in October 2013 had proposed that DAE should take over the institute to develop it as a center for excellence for cancer treatment, education and research for the entire North East.
