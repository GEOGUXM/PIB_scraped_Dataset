    In connection with collection of Parking fee for Autorickshaws at Prepaid counter of Thiruvananthapuram Central station, Railways held discussions with representatives of trade unions on 18th July 2017. As the implementation faced adamant resistance and threat by a section of unions, Railways have decided to seek help of district and local administration for its implementation, to avoid inconvenience to passengers. No decision was taken in the meeting to roll back from collection of parking fees.
