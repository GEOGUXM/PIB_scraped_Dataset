    The Government today said that the launching of National Electronic Fund Management System (NeFMS) in 21 States and one UT for direct transfer of wages into workers account, eFMS, Direct Benefit Transfer, Aadhaar based payment System are among the several measures being taken to tackle issues like misappropriation of funds, corruption and other irregularities under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) from time to time. Replying to a question in the Rajya Sabha, the Minister of State for Rural Development Shri Ram Kripal Yadav said that since the responsibility of implementation of MGNREGA is rested with the State Governments, all complaints received in the Ministry are forwarded to the concerned state Governments for taking appropriate action including investigation, as per law.


    The Minister said that adequate measures for assuring transparency and accountability have been built in the MGNREG Scheme. There are provisions of Social Audit, Grievance Redressal Mechanism, State Quality Monitor(SQM), National Level Monitors (NLM). Moreover, information pertaining to all transactions are in public domain ( www.nrega.nic.in ) and the payments to the workers are made through Bank/Post Office account. The e-Muster system has been introduced to avoid bogus attendance and to check instances of tampering and misuse of muster rolls.
