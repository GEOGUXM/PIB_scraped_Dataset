    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted with the players and officials of the Indian Women’s Cricket Team that recently participated in the Women’s Cricket World Cup.

    
    The players said that this was the first time that they had seen a Prime Minister tweet for the Women’s Cricket Team. They said that that they felt proud, happy and inspired to know that the Prime Minister was following their progress.
    
    Responding to questions asked by the players on handling pressure, the Prime Minister said that Yoga helps achieve a good balance between mind, body and action. He also said that practice of Yoga helps develop detachment.
    
    Telling the players that they had not “lost”, the Prime Minister said that 125 crore Indians carried their defeat in the final, on their shoulders, and this was, in fact, their greatest victory.
    
    Noting that India’s daughters have made the nation proud in many international sporting events, the Prime Minister said that the society is benefiting from the progress that women are making in various fields. Besides sports, he mentioned the school results of Class 10 and 12; and women space scientists who have played a key role in prestigious ISRO missions.
    
    The players presented a signed cricket bat to the Prime Minister.
