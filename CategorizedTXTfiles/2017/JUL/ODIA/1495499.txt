      Posted On: 12 JUL 2017 4:21PM by PIB Bhubaneshwar


    A news item had appeared in a section of media today about Ms. Kanchanmala Pande, a Para Swimmer. As per media reports she had to face hardship as she has no money. The Minister of Youth Affairs & Sports Shri Vijay Goel immediately sought report from his ministry and came to know that Ms. Kanchanmala was part of the Indian Para Swimming team which visited Germany from 3rd to 9th July, 2017. Whereas, the Ministry through SAI released Rs. 3.21 Lakhs as 75% of dues as advance payment to Paralympic Committee of India(PCI) in time and arranged travel tickets etc. This amount was transferred in the account of PCI on 22nd June, 2017. Since the amount was transferred to the account of PCI, the players should not have been put to any hardship.
    
    In the wake of the news reports Shri Vijay Goel also spoke to the CEO, PCI. He informed the Minister that for some reasons the money was not further transferred by PCI to the team members.
    
    The Sports Minister found this as very unfortunate and has ordered that a report from the PCI be sought in the matter within ten days.
