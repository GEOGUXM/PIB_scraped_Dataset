    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, arrived at Ben Gurion Airport, Tel Aviv today.


    As part of an elaborate official welcome ceremony, Prime Minister of Israel Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, received Prime Minister Modi on arrival. Prime Minister Modi inspected a ceremonial Guard of Honour.


    Prime Minister Netanyahu began his press statement with the Hindi words " आपका स्वागत है मेरे दोस्त." He said the Prime Minister is welcomed with open arms and even the sky is not the limit for cooperation between the two countries. He described the Prime Minister as a great leader and a "world leader."


    Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister began with the Hebrew greeting "Shalom le'kulam. He went on to add in Hebrew "I am delighted to be here in Israel."


    He recalled, the Israeli operation at Entebbe, exactly 41 years ago on the 4th of July, when Prime Minister Netanyahu's elder brother had laid down his life, while saving many Israeli hostages.


    In our path of sustained high growth, and all around development, India counts Israel among its important partners, the Prime Minister said.


    Alongside building a partnership for shared economic prosperity, we are also cooperating to secure our societies against common threats such as terrorism, he added.


    Expressing his keenness to meet the Indian diaspora in Israel, he said Jews of Indian origin, have enriched both our societies.
