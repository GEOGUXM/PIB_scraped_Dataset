    Shri Babul Supriyo gave a thumbs up to the Sports Ministry’s initiative of Slum Yuva Daud and called it “innovative step” to tap young talent.
    
    Shri Ramesh Bidhuri appreciated the Sports Ministry’s initiative and encouraged the children to participate in run wholeheartedly. The Singh Sisters urged the youth to participate in sporting activities and promote healthy living and cited sports and youth as two pillars of India’s strength.
    
    The Slum Yuva Daud is part of the Adopt Slum Campaign initiated by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports and Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan which aims at highlighting the government’s pro-people schemes among masses. Goel further stated that the “Adopt a Slum” campaign will involve groups like NSS, public schools, RWAs, NGOs, rotary clubs etc. Total 11 Slum Yuva Runs have been planned out of which 8 have already been successful with mass participation of youth from various Delhi slums.
