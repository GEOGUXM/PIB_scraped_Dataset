    The Inland Waterways Authority of India has plans for construction of 18 ferry terminals in six cities of Varanasi, Patna, Munger, Bhagalpur, Kolkata and Haldia on NW-1 or the River Ganga, under the Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP). The project aims at capacity augmentation of navigation on the Haldia â€“ Varanasi stretch of National Waterway-1. IWAI has engaged a reputed consultant for preparation of Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the development of ferry services at these places. The consultants have started the preparatory work for identifying suitable locations.
