    Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that in his view, we can be more history conscious as a society, and preserve aspects of our history much better.
    
    He said that the Presidency is much more than protocol. Through the photographs in the book, we see the human side of our President and we feel proud, the Prime Minister said.
    
    Shri Narendra Modi said that two pictures of Mahatma Gandhi, one with a broom, and the other, seeing something through a microscope, show what a diverse personality he had.
    
    Newspapers show some aspects of a leader, but there are more aspects to a leader than only what is published in the papers, the Prime Minister said.
    
    He said that it is his privilege that he got to work with Shri Pranab Mukherjee. Recounting his experiences, the Prime Minister said that several times, he had got to work with leaders and workers of very different ideologies.

He said President Pranab Mukherjee had guided him like a father figure, He said the President would even tell him to take adequate rest, and take care of his health.
