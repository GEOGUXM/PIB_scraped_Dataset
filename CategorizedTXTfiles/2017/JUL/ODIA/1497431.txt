    NITI Aayog has conducted an evaluation study on ‘Nai Roshni’- the scheme for Leadership Development of Minority Women in 2015-16 and prepared a report in June, 2016. The main objective of the study was to assess the impact of the scheme on minority women and to identify policy/ programme impediments in implementation of the scheme. The study covered 15 Districts, 30 Blocks, 87 Villages and 27 NGOs spread over 8 (eight) states namely Assam, West Bengal, Punjab, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.
    
    According to NITI Aayog, majority of the findings of the study indicate that the programme has been appreciated by most of the segments of the population of the society and it has assisted in creating confidence among minority women and developing leadership spirit in them. Moreover, the trained women are also utilizing their enriched knowledge within their surroundings and thereby helping their families as well as neighbours in raising their essential demands and claims from various Government authorities.
    
    This information was given by Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, the Minister of State for Minority Affairs (IC), in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha, today.
