      Posted On: 31 JUL 2017 5:02PM by PIB Bhubaneshwar


    The only GM crop permitted for cultivation in the country by the Central Government is Bt cotton.


    The safety aspects of genetically modified crops are assessed by the Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBSCs), Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation (RCGM) and Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) constituted under Rules 1989 of Environment Protection Act (EPA) â€“ 1986 based on Biosafety Guidelines and the Standard Operating Procedures.


    GM crops are permitted for environmental release and cultivation only after undergoing elaborate food and environmental safety assessment following regulatory guidelines and standard operating procedures under Rules1989 of EPA-1986 and no GM crop is allowed for cultivation, if it poses any risk to the environment including human and animal health. So far, only GM Mustard and Bt Brinjal have been recommended by GEAC to Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Government of India for consideration for environmental release and cultivation.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Science & Technology and Earth Sciences Shri Y.S.Chowdary in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
