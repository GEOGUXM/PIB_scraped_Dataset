      Posted On: 20 JUL 2017 6:33PM by PIB Bhubaneshwar


    During the period April, 2016 to December, 2016, the coal based power generation grew by 6.18 per cent to 674.492 Billion Units over the same period in the previous year. Dispatch of coal and coal products to power sector from Coal India Limited (CIL) sources in October, 2016 was 31.91 Million Tonnes (MT) as against 34.50 MT in October, 2015. This was stated by Shri Piyush Goyal, Minister of State (IC) for Power, Coal & New and Renewable Energy and Mines in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today. This was due to more than adequate availability of coal in stock at power plants and better quality of coal resulting in improvement of Station Heat Rate and reduction in coal consumption per unit of power, despite higher generation.
    
    The Minister further stated that the target of coal production for CIL for 2017-18 has been as 600 MT. The coal production of CIL have been 462.422 MT, 494.238 MT, 538.754 MT and 554.14 MT in the years 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16 & 2016-17 respectively. There is a continuous annual growth in coal production by CIL, the Minister added.
