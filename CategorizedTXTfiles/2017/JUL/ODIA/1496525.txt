    The MoU would lead to set up a Joint Working Group, drawing members from Department of Space/ Indian Space Research Organisation (DOS/ISRO), and the Netherlands Space Office (NSO), which will further work out the plan of action including the time-frame and the means of implementing this MoU. It will provide impetus to explore newer research activities and application possibilities in the field of remote sensing of the earth; satellite communication; satellite navigation; space science and exploration of outer space.
    
    The MoU would lead to develop a joint activity in the field of application of space technologies for the benefit of humanity. Thus all sections and regions of the country will get benefited.
    
    Background:
    
    DOS/ISRO Centres have long association with ITC (International Institute for Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation, University of Twente) Netherlands on capacity building; and with the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) for carrying out calibration/ validation experiments on earth observation. Antrix Corporation, the Commercial arm of Department of Space (DOS) launched a satellite belonging to the Netherlands (DELFI-C3) in April 2008. Officials of ISRO and the Netherlands Space Office (NSO) discussed on the modalities of building space cooperation between two countries.
