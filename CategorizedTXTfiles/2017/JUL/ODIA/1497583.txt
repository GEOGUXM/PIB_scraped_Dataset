      Posted On: 27 JUL 2017 3:11PM by PIB Bhubaneshwar


    The Ministry of Civil Aviation proposes to allow the use of Wi-Fi in commercial aircrafts operating over Indian territory. The proposal for providing on-board Wi-Fi services involves amendments of provisions of Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and Indian Telegraph Rules made there under. The Department of Telecom (DoT) has already moved a proposal for providing in-flight connectivity for voice, data and video services for consideration of the Committee of Secretaries.


    As of now, Wi-Fi in-flight Entertainment System (Transmitting - Portal Electronic Device) is an independent system and is not connected to aircraft control systems, making it safe for aircraft operations.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Civil Aviation Shri Jayant Sinha in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
