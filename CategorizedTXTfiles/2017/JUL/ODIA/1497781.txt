      Posted On: 27 JUL 2017 2:24PM by PIB Bhubaneshwar


    The Indian satellite launching station located at Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota has two launch pads - the First Launch Pad (FLP) and the Second Launch Pad (SLP). A Second Vehicle Assembly Building (SVAB) is being established at the Second Launch Pad to overcome the limitation in the number of vehicles that can be assembled and integrated in a year, which is expected to be ready by the beginning of next year. In addition to enabling a significant increase in the launch frequency from the existing two launch pads, the SVAB can also cater to the requirements of a third launch pad at Sriharikota in future.
