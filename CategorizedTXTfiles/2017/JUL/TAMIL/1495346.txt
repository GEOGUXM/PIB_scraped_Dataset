      * Consumers appealed not to pay any amount over and above the prices fixed by EESL for the UJALA appliances


    The prices of energy efficient appliances distributed under the Government of India’s Unnat Jeevan by Affordable LEDs and Appliances for All (UJALA) scheme have been revised, owing to the rollout of the Goods & Services Tax (GST). The 9W LED bulbs are priced Rs70/-, 20W LED tube light Rs 220/- and 5-star rated fans will be available at Rs1,200/- only.


    Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), under the administration of Ministry of Power, Government of India and the nodal agency for implementation of the UJALA programme has appealed all consumers not to pay any amount over and above the prices fixed by EESL for the UJALA appliances.


    If consumers notice any discrepancy in prices, they should immediately report such cases at “Register your complaint” section on UJALA dashboard, or on EESL social media handles - for Twitter @EESL_India and for Facebook @EESLIndia. They can also contact the All-India EESL Helpline number 1800 180 3580 or email at helpline@eesl.co.in. Consumers can also register their complaints at the EESL complaint logging portal - http://support.eeslindia.org/.


    BEE 5-star rated energy efficient fans distributed by EESL are of 50 Watts, which are 30 percent more efficient than the fans available in market. The LED bulbs and LED tube lights provided under the UJALA scheme come with a three-year free replacement warranty while the energy efficient fans come with a 2.5 year technical warranty.


    During the distribution, replacements can be done through any of the distribution counters that would be operating within the city. The list of the distribution counters can be found out on the National UJALA dashboard – www.ujala.gov.in.


    The UJALA scheme was launched by the Government of India on January 5, 2015 with a target of replacing 77 crore inefficient bulbs with Energy Efficient LED Bulbs. Currently, over 24.8 crore LED bulbs, 27.6 lakh tube lights and 10 lakh fans have already been distributed across 28 states. This has led to annual energy savings of more than 3,244 crore kWh and resulting in avoidance of over 6,525 MW of peak demand. The estimated cumulative cost reduction in bills of consumers, per year is INR 12,963 crores and has also helped in reduction of 2.62 crore tonnes of CO2 per annum.
