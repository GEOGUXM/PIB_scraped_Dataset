2    Interoperability between CRAs                                                Karvy Computershare Pvt. Ltd. (KCRA) was selected as a second CRA under NPS. Now, Subscribers/ Nodal Offices have option to open permanent retirement account with either of the CRAs. The existing Subscriber can also select CRA of his/her choice. To facilitate migration of Subscriber across CRAs (Karvy- CRA to NSDL- CRA and NSDL-CRA to Karvy- CRA), the CRA Interoperability functionality has been developed. The Subscriber will be required to approach target CRA to initiate the shifting request, the target CRA will facilitate the shifting request under NPS. Inter CRA shifting request will be allowed once in a financial year.

Addition of Billdesk as new payment gateway has ensured participation of new banks which were not part of SBl e-Payment gateway especially AXIS Bank and HDFC Bank.

1.     Online Subscriber Registration by DDOs                     The facility to register Subscriber online using Online PRAN Generation Module (OPGM) is made available to Drawing and Disbursing Office (DDOs) for Government Sector. The DDOs can capture the Subscriber registration details online in the CRA system. The details entered by DDO needs to be verified by associated PAOs. On verification of registration details in the CRA system, PRAN gets generated online. This facility is an extension to the functionality already available with Pay & Account Offices (PAOs).

This will save efforts and time of multiple ERM requests being captured by different Nodal Offices.
