    Till 2016-17, each Indian Institute of Science Education & Research (IISER) had a different fee structure. The National Institutes of Technology, Science Education & Research (NITSER) Council in its meeting held on 26th May, 2017 fixed the tuition fee for Ph.D. programmes in all IISERs at Rs. 16,500 per semester. However, old students will continue to pay at the old rate only and the new level of tuition fee will apply only to the new students for entire duration of their course. All Ph.D. students in IISERs are provided scholarships per month which is higher in comparison to semester fees. No case of students unable to continue their studies due to fee hike in IISERs has come to the notice of the Government.

    
    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey today in a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question.
