      Utilisation of Vacant Railway Land
      Posted On: 21 JUL 2017 4:11PM by PIB Delhi

      
      The vacant land is leased/licensed for generation of non-tariff revenue for development of ancillary logistic support/infrastructure required for Railways operational needs such as bulk oil installations & oil depots, steel yards, concrete sleeper plants, coal dumps, connectivity to private sidings commercial plots, vending stalls, etc. The vacant land, which is not required by Railways for its immediate operational needs, is also utilized in the interim period for commercial development through Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA), wherever feasible, in order to mobilize additional financial resources.
      
      Railways has also planned to utilize vacant Railway land where commercial development is not feasible for Railways’ captive energy sources, such as solar/wind energy.
      
      Commercial development of Railway land is undertaken through open competitive bidding. Any one fulfilling the eligibility criteria and other terms & conditions as stipulated in bid document can participate. However, for production of (solar/wind) energy, “Railway Energy Management Corporation Limited” (REMCL), a Railways’ owned corporate, has been involved.
      
      This Press Release is based on the information given by the Minister of State for Railways Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha on 21.07.2017 (Friday).
