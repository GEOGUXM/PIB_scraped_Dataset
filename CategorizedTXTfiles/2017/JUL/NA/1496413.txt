      In Namami Gange project total number of 155 projects for various activities such as sewage infrastructure, river front development, ghat and crematoria, ghat cleaning, rural sanitation etc. has been sanctioned. Out of 155 projects 39 numbers of projects have been completed so far.


      Cleaning of river Ganga is being carried out through various activities including treatment of municipal sewage, treatment of industrial effluent, river surface cleaning, rural sanitation, afforestation and biodiversity etc. The municipal sewage being generated in cities on the banks of Ganga is being managed by a mix of Interception & Diversion projects, sewerage network and sewage treatment plant (STP) projects.


      The four stretches of river Ganga where Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) levels are more than permissible limits, as monitored by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is given in table below:

      In other stretches, BOD levels are within permissible limits i.e. =<3 mg/l. However, as per monitoring reports of CPCB, entire stretch of river Ganga has high levels of faecal coliform against the prescribed limits.
