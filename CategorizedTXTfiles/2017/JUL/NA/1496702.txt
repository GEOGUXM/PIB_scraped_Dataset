    Resource Efficiency is a key element of Sustainable Development. This is reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 12 which aims to Ensure Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns. Eight other SDG goals (2, 6, 7,8,9,11,14 and 15) also have a bearing on resource efficiency.

    
    There is a global commitment to achieving resource efficiency in order to establish sustainable consumption and production patterns. It is also a priority for the Government of India, and is reflected in various policies/programme announcements like Make in India, Zero Effect-Zero Defect Scheme, Smart Cities, Swach Bharat, and Ganga Rejuvenation Mission.
    
    NITI Aayog in partnership with Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH had prepared a Strategy Paper on Resource Efficiency. This paper was hosted on NITI Aayog’s website for public comments.
    
    A meeting was in the NITI Aayog today held under the Chairmanship of Shri. Ratan P. Watal, Principal Adviser, NITI Aayog. The Strategy Paper along with the comments received was discussed with all stakeholders including representatives of various Departments in Government of India, Energy and Resources Institute, Members of the Indian Resource Panel, Representatives from German Embassy and other International Agencies. The Industry Associations like FICCI and CII also participated in the deliberations.
    
    All participants welcomed this initiative of NITI Aayog and it was agreed that the Strategy Paper on finalization could be the basis for future action on Resource Efficiency in the country.
