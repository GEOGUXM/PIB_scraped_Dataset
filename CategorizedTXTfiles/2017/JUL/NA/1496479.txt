      The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has identified 208 number of level crossings for construction of ROBs under Setu Bharatam through budgetary support. At present, an amount of Rs. 86.25 crore have been spent on implementation.


      Feasibility study of 87 RoBs have been completed. The visual condition survey of bridges on National Highways has been undertaken under Indian Bridge Management System. 147 bridges have been found to be under rated, requiring detailed study.


      IRC guidelines (IRC 112-2011) relating to design of bridges have been issued to make bridges durable in various exposure conditions. The Government has decided to have standard drawings on the basis of the above guidelines.
