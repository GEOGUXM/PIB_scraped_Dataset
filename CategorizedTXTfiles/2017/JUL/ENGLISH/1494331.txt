    The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will address the Assistant Secretaries of IAS-2015 batch here tomorrow. This is the third batch of IAS Officers to commence their career with a stint in the Central Government.

    
    All the 175 Officers have been posted as Assistant Secretaries by the Government of India in 42 Ministries (58 Departments) of the Central Government for three months from July 03, 2017 to September 29, 2017 after their Phase-II training at the Lal Bahadur Shashtri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie.
    
    During their three-month central deputation they would be provided a holistic overview of the functioning of the Central Government through individual projects, group projects, concurrent review of projects suggested by earlier batches with a view to providing exposure of office functioning of Government of India to the young IAS officers at a very early stage in their career. As primary implementers in the field, this exposure would also facilitate a broader macro perspective when they work in the field.
