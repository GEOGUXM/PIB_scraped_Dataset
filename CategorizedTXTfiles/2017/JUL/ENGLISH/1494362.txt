      The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee has extended his greetings and felicitations to the Government and people of the United States of America on the eve of their Independence Day (July 04, 2017).
      
      In a message to His Excellency Mr. Donald J. Trump, the President of the United States of America, the President has said, “On behalf of the Government, the people of India and on my own behalf, I extend warm greetings and felicitations to Your Excellency and to the people of the United States of America on the occasion of your nation’s Independence Day.
      
      The strategic partnership between our two nations – the world’s oldest democracy and the world’s largest democracy – is based on shared values and the growing convergence of our strategic interests. Today, our multi-faceted strategic partnership spans almost every aspect of human activity and has a critical global significance.
      
      India attaches high priority to further expanding and deepening its relations with the United States. I am happy that the recent visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the United States and his discussions with you have provided greater opportunities for our two countries to take our mutually beneficial co-operation to greater heights in the years to come.
      
      I take this opportunity to convey to you our best wishes for your good health and well-being as well as for the continued progress and prosperity of the people of the United States of America”.
