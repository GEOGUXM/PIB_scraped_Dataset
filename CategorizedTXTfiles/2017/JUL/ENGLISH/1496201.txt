    National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation has been regularly conducting nation-wide surveys on various socio-economic subjects. Results of these surveys are used for planning, policy formulation and decision making.

    
    Currently, 75th round of National Sample Survey on Household Consumer Expenditure and Household Social Consumption on Health & Education is in progress. Fieldwork for collection of data for survey is from 1st July, 2017 to 30th June, 2018. NSSO has also launched a new employment-unemployment survey, namely, Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS). PLFS is a continuous/regular survey for generating estimates of various labour force indicators on quarterly basis for urban areas and annual basis for both rural and urban areas, at State/UT and all-India level.
    
    During its next round, i.e., 76th round (July, 2018 â€“ December, 2018), NSSO has planned to conduct an all-India survey on i) Drinking Water, Sanitation, Hygiene & Housing Conditions and ii) Disability.
    
    With a view to collect data directly using handheld IT devices (tablets) in place of paper schedule, a Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) solution, developed by NSSO with technical assistance from the World Bank, is being used for collecting data for the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS). Further, a Standing Steering Committee of NSSO on IT has been constituted to facilitate switching over from the paper schedule, being used for collection of data in its regular socio-economic surveys, to digital methods & tools.
    
    This information was given by Minister For Statistics And Programme Implementation Shri D.V. Sadananda Gowda in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
