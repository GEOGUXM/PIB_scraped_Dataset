    The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee received the first copy of the book “President’s Lady” (Pranaber Preyosi) on his wife Late Smt. Suvra Mukherjee today (July 13, 2017) from Vice President of India, Mohd. Hamid Ansari who formally released it at a function held at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

    
    Speaking on the occasion, the President said that he was grateful to Ms. Sangeeta Ghosh, author of the book and all those who have brought out the publication. He said that Late Smt. Suvra Mukherjee was essentially a private person with a strong interest in music (particularly Tagore music) and paintings. He said that she was not into politics but came to know a large number of political personalities. However, she confined herself to music, painting and writing. She tried to take Tagore music to a non-Bengali audience. He wished those who brought out the book the very best for their future endeavours.
