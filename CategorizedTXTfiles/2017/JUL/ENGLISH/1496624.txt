    *As on 16.09.2016


    For construction of AWCs in convergence with Ministry of Rural Development, joint guidelines were issued by Ministries of Women & Child Development, Rural Development and Panchayati Raj on 17.02.2016 for construction of 4 lakhs Anganwadi Centre Buildings across the country under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). Under convergence, plan expenditure up to Rs.5.00 lakh per AWC building is allowed from MGNREGS. Expenditure beyond Rs.5.00 lakh per AWC including finishing, flooring, painting, plumbing, electrification, wood work etc. to the extent of Rs.2.00 lakh is met from the ICDS funds in the existing cost sharing ratio between Centre and States.


    For drinking water and sanitation facilities in AWCs, States/UTs can tap the funds from Panchayati Raj Institutions as funds are available with them under 14 th Finance Commission grants.


    Government of India has impressed upon the State Governments/UT Administrations to make the provisions for drinking water and toilet facilities at Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) from time to time by making efforts to leverage funds from other schemes of the State Government like MPLADS, MLALADS, Rural Infrastructure Development Funds etc
