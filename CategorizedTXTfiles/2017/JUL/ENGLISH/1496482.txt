    In order to ensure timely completion of the projects, regular meetings are held with project developers, state governments and contractors. Regular review meetings are held in Head Quarter by Ministry with Regional Officers, concessionaires and contractors to make the construction of projects hassle free. To expedite completion of these projects various steps are taken which include streamlining of land acquisition & environment clearances, exit for equity investors, premium re-schedulement, close coordination with other Ministries, revamping of dispute resolution mechanism, frequent reviews at various levels etc.
