    There is no specific legislation to safeguard the interest of children in the event of inter-country parental abduction (removal and retention). The Ministry of Women and Child Development has held a multi-stakeholder National Consultation on 3rd February 2017 to discuss the issue, keeping in mind the Indian realities and existing Indian Constitutional provisions. Subsequently, a multi member Committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Hon'ble Justice Sh. Rajesh Bindal, head of the Chandigarh Judicial Academy, Chandigarh to examine and comment on different aspects involved in the issue.


    A meeting of the committee has been held on 3.6.2017 at Chandigarh. A concept note has been uploaded on the Ministryâ€™s website for seeking comments of the common people including diverse stakeholders.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Women & Child Development, Smt Krishna Raj in reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
