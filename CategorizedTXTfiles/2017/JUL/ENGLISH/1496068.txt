An amount of Rs.169.28 crores has been released so far to States for implementation of the pulses programme.


    In order to create awareness among the farming community with regard to cultivation of pulses, Government of India has been taking steps like organization of cluster/cropping system based demonstrations on latest crop production technology, cropping system based training, etc. through State Governments and Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). Besides, seed production of pulses through seed-hubs has also been taken up by ICAR Institutes/Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs)/State Agricultural Universities (SAUs).
