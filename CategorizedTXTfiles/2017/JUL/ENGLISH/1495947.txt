    The appointment of non-official (Independent) Directors on the Boards of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) is a continuous process. The non-official Directors are appointed on the Boards of CPSEs by the concerned administrative Ministries on the basis of recommendations of Search Committee and after obtaining the approval of competent authority. During the last three years, i.e. 2015, 2016 and 2017 (till date), Search Committee has recommended the names for filling up 144, 233 and 15 positions of non-official Directors (including 85 women), on the Boards of various CPSEs. The concerned Ministries are being regularly requested to furnish the proposals for filling up vacant positions of non-official Directors on the Boards of CPSEs under their respective administrative jurisdiction.

    
    As per available information, there are presently around 380 vacant positions of non-official Directors on the Boards of various CPSEs. The non-official Directors are appointed for a tenure of three years and the non-official Directors of CPSEs vacate their positions after completion of their prescribed tenure.
    
    This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Lok Sabha today.
