    As per the existing frame work, the concerned State Government is required to undertake necessary relief measures in case of natural disasters through the funds readily available in the corpus of the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) as per norms. In case of a disaster of ‘severe nature’, additional assistance is extended from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) after following the laid down procedure.
    
    As reported by State Government an amount of Rs. 71.01 crore is available in SDRF account as on 1st April 2017 for management of relief necessitated by notified natural disasters in the affected areas during 2017-18. In addition, the Government of India has released 1st instalment of central share amounting to Rs. 9.45 crore from SDRF to the State on 21st July 2017.
    
    In the instant case, upon receipt of the memorandum from the State Government of Manipur, an Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) visited the affected areas of the State from 13th to 16th July 2017 for an on-the-spot assessment of damages caused by the flood/ landslides of 2017. Keeping in view the intensity & magnitude of floods of 2017 in Manipur, it has been adjudged a calamity of a ‘severe nature’ for all practical purposes.
    
    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question by Shri K. Bhabananda Singh in the Rajya Sabha today.
