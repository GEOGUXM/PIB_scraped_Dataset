There is no BPL category under NFSA.

The highly subsidized prices of foodgrains under NFSA i.e. Rs.1/2/3 per kg for coarse grains/wheat/rice have been continued upto June, 2018. Distribution of subsidized foodgrains under Targeted Public Distribution System is now governed by the provisions of NFSA.
