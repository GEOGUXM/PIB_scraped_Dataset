      Posted On: 19 JUL 2017 4:31PM by PIB Delhi


    CSIR has one laboratory established in Gujarat. CSIR-Central Salt & Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSMCRI) was set-up in Bhavnagar, Gujarat in April, 1954 . No new lab has been established in last 3 years. The significant work carried out by CSIR-CSMCRI are as below:


    a) Societal interventions:


    (i) The commercial cultivation of Kappaphycus (seaweed) in Tamil Nadu has fueled the rural economy and agricultural productivity. The approximate number of beneficiaries (mostly women in coastal fishermen communities) is given below:

            
2014-15  200
            
            
            
2015-16  250
            
            
            
2016-17  325
            
            

    (ii) CSIR-CSMCRI deployed it’s indigenously developed “mobile water purification unit” in worst-ever draught affected Latur city (Marathwada region) for providing safe and clean water for drinking purposes. Around 40,000-50,000 litres per day clean drinking water was distributed to the locals for 10 days. Approximately, 2500 people per day were benefitted from this intervention. The RO bus was stationed at “Gorakshan” well in the heart of city and potable water of 104-150 ppm was made available to the people.


    (iii) CSIR-CSMCRI’s scientific interventions in solar salt works in Rajasthan and Gujarat have helped in quality and yield improvement of the solar salt. Regular trainings and capacity building programs have been conducted in these states and the approximate number of beneficiaries (year-wise) is given below:

    b) Others Achievements:


    · Established a model salt farm at Markannam in Tamil Nadu;


    · Designed double fortified salt containing iron and iodine to fight against anemia and goitre;


    · Installation of water purification units during Chennai floods;


    · Improvement in quality and yield of solar salt for small scale salt manufacturers through scientific interventions in Didwana and Nawa of Rajasthan;


    · Development of high performance solar distillation units for producing potable water in solar salt works;


    · CSIR-CSMCRI has installed 1000 LPH capacity brackish water RO plant in mental health hospital cum rehabilitation centre at Ervadi Village, Ramanathapuram (Tamil Nadu). The plant is based on indigenously developed RO membrane technology to provide safe and clean drinking water; and


    · More than 400 marginal salt producers were given trainings for high purity solar salt production in Rajasthan and Gujarat.
