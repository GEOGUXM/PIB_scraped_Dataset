        Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


        Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall have been given in following sub-sections:


        1.1 Crude oil production by ONGC during June, 2017 was 1859.48 TMT which is 1.69% lower than the monthly target but 3.13% higher when compared with June, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-June, 2017 was 5640.77 TMT which is 0.22% lower than target for the period but 2.71% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


        Ø Offshore: Natural decline/increase in water cut from matured fields of Western Offshore and repair job of sub-sea lines.


        Ø Onshore: GEB power shutdowns / electrical faults due to heavy rain / flood in Mehsana and pressure decline & increase in water cut in Gandhar field affected Ankleshwar production


        1.2 Crude oil production by OIL during June, 2017 was 278.71 TMT which is 2.03% lower than monthly target but 5.03% higher than production in June, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-June, 2017 was 839.86 TMT which is 1.91% lower than target for the period but 5.22% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


        Ø Less than planned achievement due to higher decline in production potential of wells mainly in Greater Hapjan and Greater Chandmari areas.


        Ø Less than planned contribution from work over wells.


        1.3 Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during June, 2017 was 846.32 TMT which is 3.12% lower than the monthly target and 5.78% lower than June, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-June, 2017 was 2541.74 TMT which is 4.08% lower than target for the period and 6.23% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


        Ø RJ-ON-90/1 (CIL): Around 100 wells are closed either due to high water cut or require WOJ and poor reservoir performance of Bhagyam. Power fluid pumps maintenance job ongoing in Mangala.


        Ø Panna-Mukta (BG): Closure of certain wells in June 2017 owing to well integrity issues and natural decline.


        Ø CY-ONN-2002/2 (ONGC): Test production from 5 oil wells. PML not yet granted.


        Ø CB-ONN-2004/2 (ONGC): Underperformance of wells


        Natural Gas


        2 Natural gas production during June, 2017 was 2755.48 MMSCM which is 2.75% lower than the target for the month but 6.05% higher when compared with June, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production during April-June, 2017 was 8057.72 MMSCM which is 5.55% lower than target for the period but 4.04% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II. Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of June, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April-June, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

        Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production


        2.1 Natural gas production by ONGC during June, 2017 was 1974.47 MMSCM which is 1.59% higher than the monthly target and 12.92% higher when compared with June, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC during April-June, 2017 was 5728.81 MMSCM which is 1.92% lower than the cumulative target but 10.76% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year.


        2.2 Natural gas production by OIL during June, 2017 was 237.36 MMSCM which is 1.70% lower than the monthly target and 1.61% lower than June, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-June, 2017 was 723.52 MMSCM which is 0.24% lower than the cumulative target and 0.98% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. The major reason for shortfall in production was unplanned shutdown in BVFCL, Namrup Plant –Unit-III .


        2.3 Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during June, 2017 was 543.65 MMSCM which is 16.15% lower than the monthly target and 10.67% lower when compared with June, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-June, 2017 was 1605.39 MMSCM which is 18.29% lower than the cumulative target and 12.82% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


        Ø Sohagpur West (RIL): Underperformance of CBM wells. Production restrained due to maximum CBM intake limited by IFFCO to 1,80,000 SCMD at GAIL’s Phulpur terminal


        Ø Raniganj East (Essar): Few wells closed for planned maintenance and refrac jobs


        Ø AAP-ON-94/1 (HOEC): Production deferred due to delay in grant of PML.


        Ø Closure of 2 wells in D1D3 field and 1 well in MA field in KG-DWN-98/3 (RIL).


        Ø RJ-ON-90/1 (CIL): Around 100 wells are closed either due to high water cut or require WOJ and poor reservoir performance of Bhagyam. Power fluid pumps maintenance job ongoing in Mangala.


        Ø Panna-Mukta (BG): Closure of certain wells owing to well integrity.


        3. Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)


        Refinery production during June, 2017 was 20057.80 TMT which is 0.11% higher than the target for the month but 0.54% lower when compared with June, 2016.

        Note: 1 HMEL Refinery undergone major turnaround during Apr-Jun, 2017 *: Provisional


        2. Totals may not tally due to rounding off.


        3.1 CPSE Refineries’ production during June, 2017 was 12083.45 TMT which is 5.13% higher than the target for the month and 8.91% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-June, 2017 was 35690.26 TMT which is 3.55% higher than the target for the period and 5.58% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


        Ø IOCL, Guwahati: Lower due to deferment shutdown of HGU, HDT & MSQ from Apr'17 to June'17.


        Ø IOCL, Barauni: Lower due to BS- IV switchover (naphtha Containment).


        Ø IOCL, Panipat: Marginally lower than plan due to high SRGO stocks


        Ø IOCL, Gujarat: Lower Due to M&I shutdown of AU-1/AU-2/AU-4.


        Ø IOCL, Haldia: Lower due to OHCU BLE issue.


        Ø IOCL, Bongaigaon: Lower due to CDU-1 Idling due to low Crude Stock and High DHDT ISD due to HGU and DHDT S/D.


        Ø BPCL, Mumbai: Lower due to planned shutdown of CDU3, NHGU and Hydrocracker unit for Turnaround and revamp.


        Ø HPCL, Visakh: Lower due to unplanned shutdown of primary units.


        Ø CPCL, Manali & CBR: Lower than target due to CDU-3/HGU shutdown (equipment problem) in Apr'17.


        3.2 Production in JV refineries during June, 2017 was 586.91 TMT which is 36.34% lower than the target for the month and 58.39% lower than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-June, 2017 was 2594.84 TMT which is 3.39% lower than the target for the period and 41.37% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. The major reason for shortfall in production was major turnaround underway in HMEL refinery during April - June, 2017.


        3.3 Production in private refineries during June, 2017 was 7387.44 TMT which is 3.05% lower than the target for the month and 3.58% lower when compared with June, 2016. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-June, 2017 was 22613.29 TMT which is 3.44% higher than the target for the period and 2.58% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year.


        3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of June, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April-June, 2017 vis-à-vis April-June, 2016 are given at Annexures - IV and V respectively.
