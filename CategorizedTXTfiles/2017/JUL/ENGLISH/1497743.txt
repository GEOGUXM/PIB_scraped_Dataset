      Union Sports Minister shri Vijay Goel has advised the Atheletic Federation of India (AFI) to honour the Kerala High Court directive to ensure the participation of P U Chitra in 1,500 Mts race in the IIAF World Championships to be held in London from August 4.


      Shri Goel talked to AFI President Shri Adille Sumariwalla on the issue and advised him not to contest the directive given by the Kerala High Court as P U Chitra is otherwise a Wild Card entry for the World Championship.
