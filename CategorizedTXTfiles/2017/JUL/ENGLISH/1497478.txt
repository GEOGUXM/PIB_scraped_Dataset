    As a part of simplification of procedures, the Central Government had issued advisories to all States / UTs to do away with the requirement of taking affidavits for executive level jobs and for allowing self certification of certificates in a phased manner. Action in this regard is to be taken by States/ UTs. Further, as per the Central Secretariat Manual of Office Procedure (CSMOP), notification is mostly used for notifying the promulgation of statutory rules.
    
    This was stated by the Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions and Minister of State in the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office, Dr. Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question by Shri Anubhav Mohanty in the Rajya Sabha today.
