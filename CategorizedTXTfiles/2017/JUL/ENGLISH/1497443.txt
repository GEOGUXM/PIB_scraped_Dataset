      Ministry of Defence enhances Financial Powers of Armed Forces
      Posted On: 27 JUL 2017 5:05PM by PIB Delhi


    In an unprecedented move, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has decided to delegate substantial financial powers to the Armed Forces for undertaking works for perimeter security of sensitive military installations. This has been done primarily to expedite the decision making process involved in the modernisation of the security apparatus of airbases and defence installations. The Vice-Chiefs of the three Services have been empowered to place orders, procure equipment and carry out civil works without further seeking approvals of the MoD.


    The financial delegation represents a significant jump in the powers currently exercised by the Services. The Defence Minister, Shri Arun Jaitley has also fixed strict timelines to ensure that the works are undertaken on priority and in a time-bound manner to ensure full security of our critical defence assets.
