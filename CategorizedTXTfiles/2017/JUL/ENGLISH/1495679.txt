      Posted On: 14 JUL 2017 7:17PM by PIB Delhi


    The IAF has recently participated in a joint exercise with Sri Lankan forces. A transport aircraft of IAF had ferried a contingent of 65 members of IAF personnel on 09 Jul 17 to Sri Lanka with an aim of carrying out joint training. The contingent included a sky diving team along with the Air Warrior Drill Team. While at Colombo, joint para drops were carried out along with Sri Lankan troops.
    
    This exercise offered an opportunity to both, the IAF and SLAF contingent members, to observe each othersâ€™ Standard Operating Procedures as well as exchange ideas on joint operations. The Air Warrior Drill Team also displayed its immaculate coordinated weapons drill at Colombo. The team would arrive at Trivandrum on 14 Jul 17 after a very satisfying joint exercise.
