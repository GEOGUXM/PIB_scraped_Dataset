        Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has plans to digitize all impressions in a systematic way. As a prelude to this, steps have been taken to mend all the impressions for safety and legibility of each letter on them. Once process of mending of all the impressions is completed, action will be initiated to digitize all impressions and preserve them in a better manner for posterity.


        The language-wise details of the impressions are as under:-

                            
Sanskrit :             14800
                            
                            
                            
Prakrit:               2640 
                            
                            
                            
Dravidian:             59600
                            
                            
                            
Arabic & Persian etc.  13875
                            
                            

        Utmost care is taken to preserve them in conventional method from the beginning. Some of these are very old impressions which are in brittle or bad condition. They are taken care of by mending them as and when required.


        This information was given by Dr. Mahesh Sharma, Minister of State for Culture and Tourism (Independent Charge) in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
