    A Scheme for enhancement of competitiveness in the Indian Capital Goods Sector is in operation since 2014. The Scheme has infrastructural components for setting up Centre of Excellence (CoE) for technology development, Integrated Industrial Infrastructural Facility, Common Engineering Centre and Test and Certification Centre. The Scheme also provides for financial intervention through Technology Acquisition Fund Programme for acquisition or transfer of technology in Capital Goods Sector. Under different components of the said Scheme, so far, 14 proposals have been approved, which are under different stages of implementation with active participation of the Industry. Details of the Scheme is available at the website of the Department of Heavy Industry at dhi.nic.in.
