      Central Sector Schemes for Development of Sports
      Posted On: 20 JUL 2017 3:02PM by PIB Delhi


      The Minister of State (I/C) for Youth Affairs and Sports Shri Vijay Goel said in the Lok Sabha today that the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Panchayat Yuva Krida aur Khel Abhiyan (PYKKA) provided for mid-term review. Accordingly, after a review, it was in the year 2014-15 recast as Rajiv Gandhi Khel Abhiyan (RGKA), also a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, which envisaged convergence of funds from different Schemes of the Government of India. However, due to lack of convergence, the infrastructure component of the RGKA could not be implemented throughout the country and the Scheme had to be revised. Besides, there was Urban Sports Infrastructure Scheme (USIS), a Central Sector Scheme which provided for creation of sports infrastructure in the country. RGKA and USIS were subsumed in the “Khelo India – National Programme for Development of Sports” which is a Central Sector Scheme and which was evolved after consultation with stakeholders concerned.


      In a written reply he said, Under PYKKA a total number of 63214 playfields were developed at village panchayat level and block panchayat level. 62 sports infrastructure facilities were sanctioned under USIS. 2.08 crore sportspersons (both boys and girls) participated in the various sports competitions held under PYKKA/RGKA from 2008-09 to 2015-16.


      Sports is a State subject and, therefore, it is primarily the responsibility of the State Government to create adequate sports infrastructure. The Central Government complements/supplements the efforts of the State Governments. The Central Government aims to concentrate its funds mainly on internationally recognized sports but also encourages the States to promote local/indigenous/rural games.


      Details of budgetary allocation under PYKKA (from 2008-09 to 2013-14), RGKA (from 2014-15 to 2015-16) and Khelo India (from 2016-17 to 2017-18) are given below: (Rs. in crore)
