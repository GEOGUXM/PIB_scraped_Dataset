        Rs. 417.11 crore has been spent by the Ministry of AYUSH during the last financial year under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National AYUSH Mission for promotion of AYUSH including AYUSH infrastructure.


        Health is a State subject. Therefore, Ministry of AYUSH does not maintain the data regarding the number of homoeopathic doctors employed in Government Hospitals. However, there are 1149 seats for PG courses in Homoeopathy in the country.


        During the Academic Year 2016-17, seven New Homoeopathic Medical colleges were given permission having strength of total 610 UG seats. Nine existing Under Graduate Colleges were given permission to start new Post Graduate Course in Homoeopathy with strength of 231 PG seats. Two existing UG colleges were given permission to increase their admission capacity of 160 seats.


        Under “Establishment of New Medical College, (Opening of New or Higher Course of Study or Training and increase of Admission Capacity by a Medical College) Regulations, 2011” application for starting New PG Courses in Homoeopathy can be submitted to the Central Government.
