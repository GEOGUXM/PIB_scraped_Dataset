    The major schemes operated by the Ministry of Tourism for development and promotion of tourism in the country are given below:


    · Swadesh Darshan - Integrated Development of Tourist Circuits on Specific Themes


    · National Mission for Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Augmentation Drive (PRASAD)


    · Overseas Promotion and Publicity including Market Development Assistance


    · Assistance to IHMs/FCIs/IITTM/NCHMCT


    · Domestic Promotion and Publicity including Hospitality


    · Capacity Building for Service Providers


    · Computerization and Information Technology


    Tourism is a demand based concept defined not by its output but by its use. It consumes the output of various industries like Passenger Transport (Air/ Rail/Road), Hotels & Restaurants, etc. The initiatives taken by the Ministry to boost tourism in the country under various schemes would in turn benefit the various service industries by way of increasing demands and inter-alia direct and indirect employment generation.


    This information was given by Dr. Mahesh Sharma, Minister of State for Culture and Tourism (Independent Charge) in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
