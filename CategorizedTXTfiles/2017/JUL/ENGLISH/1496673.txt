The Government has ensured that the return filing process is made convenient for all taxpayers by setting up help desks in every Commissionerate and by appointing GST Suvidha Providers.
    
    This was stated by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Minister of State for Finance in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
