      Posted On: 19 JUL 2017 3:29PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government has introduced a Pan-India integrated emergency helpline number ‘112’ for implementation of Nationwide Emergency Response System (NERS) across the country with an approved financial outlay of Rs. 321.69 Crore with the objective of addressing emergencies such as those relating to Police, Fire and Health services.


    Financial support is being provided to the States/UTs to setup their Emergency Response Centers (ERCs), which will cover expenditure related to computer hardware, connectivity, well trained call takers and for a limited number of MDTs (Mobile Device Terminals) fitted vehicles for last mile service delivery to be deployed on a pilot basis. Each ERC is being provided with an emergency response software suit developed through C-DAC, Thiruvananthapuram. Establishment of ERCs in States/UTs will be carried out in a phased manner and is likely to be completed by December, 2018.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question by Smt. Viplove Thakur in the Rajya Sabha today.
