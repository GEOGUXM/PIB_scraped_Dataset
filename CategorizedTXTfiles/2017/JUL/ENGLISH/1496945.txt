      Posted On: 24 JUL 2017 5:36PM by PIB Delhi


    The major reasons for high level of pollution in river Yamuna is inadequate flow, due to over extraction of surface and ground water and discharge of untreated effluent. This Ministry is supplementing the efforts of the States for pollution abatement of river Yamuna by providing financial assistance to States of Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh in phased manner since 1993 under the Yamuna Action Plan (YAP). The total expenditure incurred on conservation of river Yamuna under the YAP Phase – I & II is Rs. 1514.70 crore.


    At present Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) assisted YAP Phase-III project is under implementation at an estimated cost of Rs 1656 crore in Delhi for rehabilitation and up-gradation of existing Sewage Treatment Plants (950 million litres per day) and Trunk sewers (43 kms) in Delhi. Delhi Jal Board is the implementing agency. The duration of YAP-III project is 7 years.


    In “Maily Se Nirmal Yamuna Revitalization Plan 2017, under Phase-I”, the Ministry has sanctioned the STP works in Command area of Najafgarh Drain (Dhansa to Keshopur) in Delhi for an estimated amount of Rs. 344.81 crore on 70:30 cost sharing basis between the Centre and the Delhi State Government. In addition to these, State Govt. of Delhi has been taking up projects for addressing the problem of pollution of river Yamuna from their own resources.


    This information was given by Union Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Vijay Goel in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
