    Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) developed various nutritious and protein-rich foods to cater the requirements of Service personnel deployed at high altitude and snow bound areas. The major food products developed by DRDO during last three years and the current year are: Chicken biscuits; Protein rich mutton bar; Composite cereals bars; Egg protein biscuits; Iron and protein rich food bar; Whey Protein based chocolate; Chicken Katti Rolls; Anti-fatigue Tulsi Bar.
    
    There is no food production unit in DRDO. However, after developing these products, production technologies have been transferred to various industries for bulk production.
    
    Development of nutritional food by DRDO for Armed Forces is an ongoing process based on their requirements and latest technological research in the area. Some of them are Processed Food Technologies / Products and Test Kits (Frozen Meat Test and Alfatoxin Detection Kits), etc.
