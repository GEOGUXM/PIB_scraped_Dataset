    Ministry of Defence is undertaking the following two types of Audit:


    Internal Audit : It is conducted by Defence Accounts Department while performing function of payment and accounting of all Defence expenditure. In certain cases this is pre-audit i.e. before release of payment and in other post-audit i.e. after payments have been realised. Internal Audit is a continuous function as it is clearly intertwined with the payment and accounting functions of Defence Account Department. The major findings of the internal Audit are highlighted in an annual internal Audit report issued by CGDA.


    External Audit : This is the statutory audit done by C&AG as in the case of other Ministries / Departments. This is also known as test Audit as it is a test check over the Internal Audit conducted by Defence Accounts Department. This is periodic and conducted as per Audit calendar.

  
  

    During the last three financial years, 154 contracts have been signed with Indian and foreign vendors involving value of Rs.2,07,296.34 crore for capital procurement of defence equipment for Armed Forces.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri Surendra Singh Nagar and Shri Sanjay Raut in Rajya Sabha today.
