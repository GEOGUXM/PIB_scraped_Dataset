      Rationalisation of Labour Laws
      Posted On: 24 JUL 2017 3:26PM by PIB Delhi


    The Second National Commission on Labour has recommended that the existing Labour Laws should be broadly grouped into four or five Labour Codes on functional basis. Accordingly, the Ministry has taken steps for drafting four Labour Codes on Wages; Industrial Relations; Social Security & Welfare; and Safety and Working Conditions respectively, by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing the relevant provisions of the existing Central Labour Laws. The draft codes are at pre-legislative consultation process. These legislative initiatives will improve the wage security, job security and social security of the workers.


    The Ministry is implementing the National Career Service (NCS) Project as a Mission Mode Project for transformation of the National Employment Service to provide a variety of employment related services. The NCS is an online Portal (www.ncs.gov.in) for providing employment services like registration of candidates and employers, posting of vacancies, job matching etc. The NCS presently has over 3.86 Cr job seekers and 14.8 lakh employers on the Portal.


    This information was given by Shri Bandaru Dattatreya the Minister of State (IC) for Labour and Employment, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha, today.
