      Posted On: 24 JUL 2017 5:33PM by PIB Delhi


    400 tanneries units are operating in Kanpur region. Out of these 400 tanneries, 386 were inspected in the Kanpur region during January-May, 2017 and 77 Gross Polluting Industries (GPIs) were issued closure directions under Section 5 of Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986 for non-compliance of discharge standards and non-installation of Online Continuous Effluent Monitoring Systems (OCEMS).


    During inspections between January-May, 2017, 118 out of 386 tanneries inspected were found complying with the discharge norms as well as OCEMS connectivity.


    In addition to regulatory actions, other measures are contemplated to reduce pollution from these tanneries. These measures include in-process improvement, setting up of a Common Effluent Treatment Plant based on Zero Liquid Discharge principle, shifting of tanneries to another suitable location. To study the feasibility of shifting the tanneries at Jajmau, Kanpur to another location, a Task Force has been constituted under the Chairmanship of Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Environment, Government of Uttar Pradesh.


    This information was given by Union Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Vijay Goel in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
