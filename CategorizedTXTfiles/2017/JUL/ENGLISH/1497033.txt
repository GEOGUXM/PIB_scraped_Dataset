    Appropriate retaliation to the ceasefire violations, as required, is carried out by Indian Army. In addition, all violations of ceasefire are taken up with Pakistan authorities at the appropriate level through the established mechanism of hotlines, flag meetings as well as weekly talks between the Directorate Generals of Military Operations of the two countries.
