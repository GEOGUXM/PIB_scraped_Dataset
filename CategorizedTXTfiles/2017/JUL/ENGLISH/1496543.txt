      Posted On: 20 JUL 2017 3:35PM by PIB Delhi


    There have been some variations in totaling of marks during verifications of marks/scrutiny which have been communicated to the students and revised marks statement issued. This year total No. of 106981 cases of Verification of Marks has been received in all the 10 Regions of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). The said variations are due to totaling of marks, unassessed portion, transfer of marks from inside the answer book to the main cover page.


    The orders of the Honâ€™ble Court have been complied by the CBSE for scrutiny of the answer scripts. A notice in this regard has been issued by the CBSE dated 28.06.2017.


    As the entire evaluation has human component, there are chances of error in the nature of totaling, posting, un-assessed, comparison. These errors are miniscule/insignificant looking into the quantum of answer books being evaluated (1 crore answer scripts of class X and XII). Hence, there is nothing wrong in the totaling process as a whole. Further in order to review and bring reform to the present evaluation system of the CBSE two Independent Committees have been formed in order to bring systemic improvement in the evaluation and post examination activities to make them error free.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Shri Upendra Kushwaha today in a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question.
