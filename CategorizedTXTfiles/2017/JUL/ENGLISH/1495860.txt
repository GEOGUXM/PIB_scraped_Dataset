      Increase in the Compensation Cess rate on cigarettes to make the total tax incidence on cigarettes in GST regime at par with the total tax incidence in pre-GST regime.
      Posted On: 17 JUL 2017 9:41AM by PIB Delhi


        In pursuance of the recommendations of the GST Council in its 14 th Meeting held on 18.05.2017 and 19.05.2017, the Compensation Cess rates under Section 8 (2) of the Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, was notified vide notification No.1/2017-Compensation Cess (Rate), dated 28.06.2017 on Intra-State or Inter-State supply of the specified goods, including cigarettes.


        In respect of cigarettes, the Fitment Committee had recommended that in line with the weighted average VAT rate [28.7%], the GST rate on cigarettes may be kept at 28%. In addition, Compensation Cess may be levied on cigarettes at rates equal to 1.05 times the Specific Excise Duty Rates [net of NCCD]. However, this method of calibrating the Compensation Cess did not take into consideration the cascading of taxes [that is in earlier regime VAT being charged on value inclusive of the excise duty]. As a result, the total tax incidence on cigarettes in GST regime has come down, as compared to the total tax in pre-GST regime.


        While any reduction in tax incidence on items of mass consumption would be welcome, the same would be unacceptable in case of demerit goods like cigarettes.


        The GST Council in its 19 th Meeting held today i.e. on 17.07.2017 reviewed the Compensation Cess rates on cigarettes and recommended the following increase in the same with effect from 00 hours on 18 th July, 2017 i.e. the midnight of 17 th and 18 th July, 2017:
