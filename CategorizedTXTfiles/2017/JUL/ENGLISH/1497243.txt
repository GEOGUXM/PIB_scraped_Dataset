      Alert System at Unmanned Level Crossings
      Posted On: 26 JUL 2017 5:17PM by PIB Delhi


    ISRO has demonstrated a satellite based solution for unmanned level crossings (UMLCs) using navigation and communication technologies to avoid accidents. By automatic triggering, the system provides alerts by blowing hooter in the locomotive as well as audio-visual warning at the level crossing about the approaching train. The concept has been successfully demonstrated and the field trials with railways are in progress.


    Indian Railways is expected to implement operational system after the completion of field trials.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
