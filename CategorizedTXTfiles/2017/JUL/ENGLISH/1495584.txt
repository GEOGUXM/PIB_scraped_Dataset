The index for ‘Manufacture of Textiles’ group rose by 0.1 percent to 113.7 (provisional) from 113.6 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of ortla yarn, viscose yarn and weaving & finishing of textiles (1% each). However, the price of manufacture of other textiles (1%) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Pharmaceuticals, Medicinal Chemical and Botanical Products’ group declined by 0.5 percent to 120.2 (provisional) from 120.8 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of sulpha drugs (7%), antibiotics & preparations thereof (2%) and anti-retroviral drugs for HIV treatment, vials/ampoule, glass (empty or filled), anti allergic drugs and plastic capsules (1% each). However, the price of antioxidants and cotton wool (medicinal) (2% each) and digestive enzymes and antacids, anti-malarial drugs and anti cancer drugs (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Other Non-Metallic Mineral Products’ group rose by 0.8 percent to 112.3 (provisional) from 111.4 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of slag cement and graphite rod (3% each), marble slab, pozzolana cement and porcelain sanitary ware (2% each) and clinker, ordinary ortland cement, granite, cement blocks (concrete), toughened glass and lime and calcium carbonate (1% each). However, the price of cement superfine, non ceramic tiles and plain bricks (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Basic Metals’ group declined by 0.1 percent to 96.7 (provisional) from 96.8 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of ferrochrome (5%), ms slabs (4%), silicomanganese (3%), brass metal/sheet/coils and aluminium disk and circles (2% each) and mild steel (ms) blooms, copper shapes-bars/rods/plates/strips, alloy steel wire rods, ms bright bars, cold rolled (CR) coils & sheets, including narrow strip, gp/gc sheet, aluminium alloys, ms pencil ingots and ms wire rods (1% each). However, the price of ferromanganese (6%), stainless steel pencil ingots/billets/slabs and zinc metal/zinc blocks (4% each), sponge iron/direct reduced iron (DRI) and alloy steel castings (3% each), stainless steel bars & rods, including flats and other ferro alloys (2% each) and cast iron, castings, aluminium castings, ms castings, stainless steel tubes and copper metal/copper rings (1% each)

The index for ‘Manufacture of Fabricated Metal Products, Except Machinery and Equipment’ group declined by 0.1 percent to 108 (provisional) from 108.1 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of stainless steel utensils (3%), cylinders and steel drums and barrels (2% each) and steel container and forged steel rings (1% each). However, the price of hand tools (4%) and bolts, screws, nuts & nails of iron & steel, iron/steel cap and steel structures (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Computer, Electronic and Optical Products’ group declined by 0.5 percent to 108.5 (provisional) from 109.1 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of ups in solid state drives and colour tv (4% each), watch and electro-diagnostic apparatus, used in medical, surgical, dental or veterinary sciences (2% each) and capacitors (1%). However, the price of meter (non-electrical) and air conditioner (3% each) and electronic printed circuit board (pcb)/micro circuit (1%) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Machinery and Equipment’ group declined by 0.5 percent to 107.8 (provisional) from 108.3 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of pressure vessel and tank for fermentation & other food processing (12%), excavator, cranes and solar power system (solar panel & attachable equipment) (5% each), rice mill machinery and moulding machine (3% each), roller and ball bearings, manufacture of bearings, gears, gearing & driving elements and printing machinery (2% each) and industrial valve, agriculture implements, drilling machine and chemical equipment & system (1% each). However, the price of precision machinery equipment/form tools (3%), pharmaceutical machinery and road roller (2% each) and pump sets without motor, air gas compressor including compressor for refrigerator, clutches and shaft couplings, injection pump, open end spinning machinery and sewing machines (1% each) moved up.
