      Posted On: 25 JUL 2017 6:54PM by PIB Delhi


    In the interest of consumers, the Government, in cooperation with GS-1 India, has launched a new Mobile App “Smart Consumer” in December, 2016. Using the App, the consumers can scan the bar code on the package and read the product related information including the labelling information of a packaged commodity.
    
    The size of the letters printed on pre-packaged commodities have been increased through an amendment in the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 vide GSR 629€ dated 23rd June, 2017. The said amendment will come into force w.e.f. 1st January, 2018 to enhance consumer protection.
    
    This information was given by Shri C. R. Chaudhary, the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha, today.
