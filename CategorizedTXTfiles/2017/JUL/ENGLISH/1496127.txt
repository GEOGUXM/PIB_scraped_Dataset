    The details are placed at Annex-I.


    As on 14.07.2017 out of the 4249 cases filed in the said Councils, 985 cases have been disposed of.


    The Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Councils (MSEFCs) are quasi


    judicial bodies in whose matters the Government of India does not directly intervene. However, the Government continuously follows up with the State Governments/UT Administrations for timely disposal of such cases. The Ministry of MSME has also developed a MSEFC Delayed Payment Monitoring System (MDPMS) for monitoring the disposal of the cases filed with MSEFCs.
