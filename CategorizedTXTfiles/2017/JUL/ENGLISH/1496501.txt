      Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr Harsh Vardhan has said that people should plant more and more saplings to stop the imbalance in nature. Leading the sapling plantation programme at Ashoka Garden, Ashok Vihar here today, Dr. Harsh Vardhan termed the planting of saplings as a divine work. He said that not only should everyone plant saplings, but should also care for the plants as a member of one’s own family. The Minister said that trees have a very important place in our lives. “They not only help in making the environment pure, but also provide life-giving oxygen, fruits, flowers, shade and cool the environment”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said.

      Dr. Harsh Vardhan pointed out that after becoming the Environment Minister, he has had the opportunity to plant saplings at several places in the country, but the pleasure that he got today in planting saplings while getting drenched in rain is an unparalleled experience. He also emphasized that plants blossom faster during the rainy season, hence a large number of saplings should be planted during this season. During the programme, the Minister impressed upon the people to remain alert towards protection of environment and added that everyone must undertake one act for the environment every day. He also urged the people to use cycle at least once a week, as it will prove beneficial to the environment, as well as our health. The Minister also asked people to protect and conserve the flora and fauna.
