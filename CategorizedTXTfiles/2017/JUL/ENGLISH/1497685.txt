He also hailed the positive and cooperative approach with which the State of Sikkim has adopted the “One Nation, One Tax” reform of GST.
    
    Shri Pawan Kumar Chamling conveyed to the DoNER Minister his concern over the blockade of the vital Rangpo-Siliguri (NH10) road link caused by the Gorkhaland protesters leading to breakdown of the only road link that exists between the State of Sikkim and the rest of India. He appealed for certain remedial measures to prevent such blockade from happening time and again.
    
    Dr Jitendra Singh took note of all the points raised by the chief minister. He said, he would deliberate on all these issues within the DONER Ministry as well as with the other concerned Ministries.
