    As per rule 4(2) of IPS Cadre Rules, 1954, the Central Government, ordinarily at the interval of every five years, reviews the strength and composition of each such cadre in consultation with the State Government(s) concerned and revises the authorized strength of the IPS for each cadre. Accordingly, the Central Government in consultation with the State Government fixes the Senior Duty Posts for a given State/Cadre. Since 2014, Cadre Review of 14 Cadres has already been notified by the Central Government.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions and Minister of State in the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office, Dr. Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question by Shri Om Prakash Mathur in the Rajya Sabha today.
