      Upgradation of Jetties at V.O. Chidambarnar Port
      Posted On: 20 JUL 2017 8:12PM by PIB Delhi


    An MoU has been signed between V.O.Chidambaranar Port Trust and Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (TANGEDCO) for the upgradation of Coal Jetty (CJ) –I & II. The estimated capacity of the new CJ – I and II will be 12 MTPA each. The upgraded CJ-I and II will help in catering to the coal requirement of TANGEDCO’s existing Thermal Power Stations (TTPS) as also the upcoming Thermal Power Stations at Uppur and Kadaladi.


    The Cost of logistics for handling coal for the thermal plants of TANGEDCO is expected to reduce due to freight advantage arising out of handling 65000 to 80000 Tonnes parcel size vessels. Handling charges per tonne will reduce due to increased discharge rate and reduced Turn Round Time of the vessel.


    This information was given by Minister of Shipping and Road Transport & Highways, Shri Pon. Radhakrishnan in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
