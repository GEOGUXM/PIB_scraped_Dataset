      Posted On: 31 JUL 2017 3:08PM by PIB Delhi


    The Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) has launched a mobile based application “AskAnAppointment” (AAA+) for booking of appointment in ESI Dispensaries in Delhi on 10th April, 2017. Through this Mobile Application, a beneficiary can seek a prior appointment for OPD Registration in the stipulated dispensary. This Application can be downloaded free of cost in Smart Phones. This project has been rolled out in ESIC Dispensaries in Delhi on a pilot basis. Initially, every ESIC Dispensary in Delhi can cater to 20 patients per day through this mobile application. Appointment can be sought up to 7 days in advance excluding the current date. The Application is available both in English and Hindi. Progressively the project is planned to be rolled out in other ESIC dispensaries, in phases, based on the response of this pilot project.


    Under ESIC 2.0 Reforms, ESI Corporation has decided to expand its services in the country. In the implemented areas where Insured person population does not meet the ESI norms for setting up health facilities, endeavour is made to provide services through mobile clinics.


    This information was given by Shri Bandaru Dattatreya, the Minister of State (IC) for Labour and Employment, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha, today.
