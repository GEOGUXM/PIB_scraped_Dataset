      Posted On: 17 JUL 2017 4:05PM by PIB Delhi


    Under the Mid-Day Meal Scheme, the present approved cooking cost per child per day for Primary and Upper Primary stages is Rs.4.13 and Rs.6.18, respectively. In addition, the Central Government provides 100% funding for Foodgrains, Transport Assistance, Kitchen Devices and Management/Monitoring Expenses. Several State/UT Governments are also contributing additional funds over and above their minimum mandatory share under the Scheme.
    
    Government of India has approved creation of a dynamic buffer of upto 20 Lakh tones of pulses for appropriate market intervention. Committee of Secretaries (COS) in the Meeting for disposal of Tur Pulses from Government of India dynamic buffer stock recommended that D/o School Education & Literacy, D/o Higher Education, M/o Human Resource Development, may firm up their requirement of Tur and other Dal and inform D/o Consumer Affairs (DOCA). The objective behind above request is, that the provision would be made to meet the requirement of pulses under Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDMS) from the already built buffer stock of pulses. The Ministry of HRD has communicated the recommendation of COS to all the States/UTs to explore the option of procuring Tur Dal from the buffer stock. Some States/UTs have indicated requirement for Milled Tur Dal with a condition that the issue price of Tur Dal must be lower than the market price prevalent in the respective States. Therefore this Ministry has requested, the Department of Consumer Affairs to furnish, state-wise issue price of processed Tur Dal and the policy on price volatility so that the States may procure Tur Dal.
    
    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Shri Upendra Kushwaha today in a written reply to a Lok Sabha question.
