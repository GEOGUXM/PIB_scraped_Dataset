      Extending Time-Limit of OPD at Central Hospitals in Delhi
      Posted On: 25 JUL 2017 4:08PM by PIB Delhi


    As far as Central Government Hospitals in Delhi, including Safdarjung Hospital, are concerned there has been constant endeavor by these hospitlas to improve the quality of treatment on the basis of feedback received from the patients through ‘MERA ASPTAAL’. Various parameters under quality treatment are monitored on regular basis and necessary instructions are issued to the Head of Departments with an objective to improve quality of treatment, cleanliness, behaviour, etc.
    
    So far as All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi is concerned, there is no proposal for extension of time limit of the OPDs due to constraint of space and infrastructure. Further, in the Central Government Hospitals namely Safdarjung and Dr. Ram ManoharLohia, all the patients registered in the OPD on a particular day are attended by the doctors on the same day. In addition, casualty services are available round-the-clock to provide treatment to the patient in case of emergency.
    
    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
