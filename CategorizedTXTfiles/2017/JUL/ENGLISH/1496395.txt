    Out of 2264 female candidates who were allotted seats in Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) in 2016, 848 joined IITs. The admission process for the current year is not over. To improve female enrolment in the B.Tech. Programmes in IITs, a Committee under the chairmanship of Director, IIT-Mandi was constituted by the Joint Admission Board (JAB) to suggest suitable measures. The report of the Committee was considered by the IIT Council in its 51st meeting held on 28.04.2017 and decided to increase female enrolment from the current 8% to 14% in 2018-19, 17% in 2019-20 and 20% in 2020-21 by creating supernumerary seats.
