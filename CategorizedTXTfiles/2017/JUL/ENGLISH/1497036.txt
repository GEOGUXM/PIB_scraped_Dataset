      Delay in Road Constructions by BRO
      Posted On: 25 JUL 2017 3:29PM by PIB Delhi


    There are delays in execution of some of the 61 ICBRs entrusted to Border Roads Organisation (BRO), mainly due to the following reasons:


    (i) Delay in Forest / Wildlife clearance.


    (ii) Hard rock stretches.


    (iii) Limited working season.


    (iv) Difficulties in availability of construction material.


    (v) Delay in land acquisition.


    (vi) Damages due to natural disasters.


    BRO has a long experience in building roads in mountainous terrain. Deficiency of construction equipment in BRO is made good from time to time and has not affected the construction of ICBRs. Indian Air Force is providing necessary air effort for transportation of equipment, as feasible.


    With a view to improve the pace of execution of infrastructure projects in the border areas, Government has approved a policy to enable BRO to outsource identified projects to other construction companies, including those in the private sector.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri Sanjay Raut in Rajya Sabha today.
