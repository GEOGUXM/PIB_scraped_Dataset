      Posted On: 21 JUL 2017 3:01PM by PIB Delhi


    The induction of Women Officers is based on the organizational requirement, fighting efficiency, combat effectiveness and functionality of the Army.


    Presently, women are inducted in Indian Army as Officers through Short Service Commission (SSC). Women Officers are inducted in Army Service Corps, Army Ordnance Corps, Army Education Corps, Judge Advocate General Branch including Engineers, Signals, Intelligence and Electrical & Mechanical Engineering branches. They have also been granted option for Permanent Commission in Judge Advocate General (JAG) Department and in Army Education Corps (AEC) of Army. There has been a progressive enhancement in the induction of women in the Army. There is no proposal to raise all women battalion in the Army.


    In the Army, women officers are being employed in the above streams and are being tasked which is commensurate to the rank and service on equal footing as male officers. In Indian Navy and Indian Air Force, women officers are inducted on same terms as male officers. For Indian Navy, the Government has approved induction of Women SSC officers as Pilots and in Naval Armament Inspectorate cadre with effect from 2017. As such, it is the endeavour of the Government to bring gender parity in all three wings of defence forces.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to T Radhakrishnan and others in Lok Sabha today.
