    In order to boost textile and handicraft industries, the government has setup power loom, handloom and handicraft clusters at various places in the country.

    
    The Government does not setup/establish new textile industries/units. The role of the Government is to ensure conducive policy environment, facilitating in creating enabling conditions for the industry and private entrepreneurs to set up units through its various policy initiatives and schemes such as the Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (TUFS), Scheme for Development of Technical Textiles, Schemes for the Development of the Powerloom Sector, Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP), Integrated Skill Development Scheme (ISDS), Schemes for Development of Silk and Sericulture sectors, National Handloom Development Programme (NHDP), Comprehensive Handloom Cluster Development Scheme (CHCDS), Yarn supply Scheme, National Handicrafts Development Programme (NHDP) and North East Region Textiles Promotion Scheme (NERTPS). Last year, Government of India had notified the Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (A-TUFS) for technology upgradation in the textiles sector. Government is also implementing the in-situ Upgradation of Plain Powerloom Scheme for upgrading the obsolete power looms to semi-automatic and automatic looms. These schemes are aimed at promotion/upgradation of textile industries/units all over the country.
    
    Further, the Government has approved a special package for textile sector with an outlay of Rs. 6,000 crore to boost employment generation and exports, particularly in Garmenting and Made-ups.
    
    The above information was given by the Minister of State, Textiles, Shri Ajay Tamta today, in a written reply to a Lok Sabha question.
