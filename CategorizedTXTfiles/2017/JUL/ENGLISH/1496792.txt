    91.23% consumer complaints disposed of against complaints filed since inception under Consumer Protection Law. The details of complaints filed/disposed of before/by the National, State and District Consumer Fora are given below in the table.


    The Government has made the following efforts for disposal of the pending backlog:


    (1) State Governments have been requested from time to time to take action well in advance for filling up of vacancies of President and Members and to maintain a panel of candidates for filling up of future vacancies also to avoid delay in appointments so that the State Commissions and the District Fora do not remain non-functional.


    (2) The Central Government has been impressing upon the State Governments and the Consumer Fora in the National level conferences and also through video conferencing to take measures to reduce the pendency of cases.


    (3) Circuit Benches from National Commission have been frequently visiting States.


    (4) Some State Commissions have constituted Additional Benches mainly to dispose of backlog of pending cases.


    (5) The National Commission and some of the State Commissions as well as District Fora are adopting the process of holding Lok Adalats for speedy disposal of the cases.


    (6) Financial assistance is provided by the Central Government to the States/UTs for strengthening of infrastructure of Consumer Fora including computerization and networking.


    The Government has introduced Consumer Protection Bill 2015 in the Parliament on 10thAugust, 2015. The bill contains a number of provisions for reforming the adjudication process in the Consumer Fora.


    The National Commission, which is empowered under the provisions of the Consumer protection Act, 1986 to monitor the functioning of the State Commissions and the District Fora, calls for periodical returns regarding the institution, disposal, pendency of cases.
