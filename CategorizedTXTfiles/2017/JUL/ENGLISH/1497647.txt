    Completion of projects depends on many factors such as land acquisition, forestry and wild life clearances, shifting of services, construction of road over and road under bridges, law and order etc. As many of these factors are not within the control of Railways, it is not feasible to fix timelines for all the projects.
    
    This Press Release is based on the information given by the Minister of State for Railways Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha on 28.07.2017 (Friday).
