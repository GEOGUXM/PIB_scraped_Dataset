    Over 2000 NGOS have been asked to validate their existing FCRA designated bank accounts and the list of these NGOs is available on website: www.fcraonline.nic.in

    
    As per Foreign Contribution Regulation Rules, 2011, all banks shall report any transaction in respect of receipt or utilization of any foreign contribution by any person whether or not such person is registered or granted prior permission under the Act, to the Central Government within 48 hours. Over 1000 NGOs which have been found to be misutilizing foreign funds and violating various provisions of FCRA, 2010 and Rules made thereunder, have been barred from operating their foreign contribution accounts.
    
    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question by Shri R. Parthipan in the Lok Sabha today.
