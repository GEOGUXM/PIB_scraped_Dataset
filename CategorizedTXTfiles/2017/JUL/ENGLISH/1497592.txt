      Infrastructure Development in Border Areas
      Posted On: 28 JUL 2017 3:43PM by PIB Delhi


    Government keeps a constant watch on all developments having a bearing on Indiaâ€™s security and takes all necessary measures to safeguard it.


    73 Indo-China Border Roads along Northern Borders are approved for construction. Out of this 27 roads have been completed and balance roads are planned for completion by December 2022. The delay in execution of road projects is due to delay in forest / wildlife / environment clearance, hard rock stretches, limited working season, delay in land acquisitions, difficulties in availability of construction material and damage due to natural disasters such as flash flood. Further, four strategic railway lines have also been approved.


    This information was given by Minister of state for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri Rajendra Agrawal in Lok Sabha today.
