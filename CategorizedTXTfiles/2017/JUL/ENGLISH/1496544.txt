      Bhagavad Gita in School Education
      Posted On: 20 JUL 2017 3:36PM by PIB Delhi


    Content related to ‘Bhagavad Gita’ is already included in National Council of Educational Research & Training (NCERT)’s Class XII Sanskrit text book, namely, Shashwati, Part-II (Chapter IV: Karma Gauravam) since 2007-08. The National Curriculum Framework-2005 brought out by NCERT states that to strengthen our cultural heritage and national identity, the curriculum should enable the younger generation to reinterpret and re-evaluate the part with reference to new priorities and emerging outlooks of a changing societal context. The document further states that the cultural diversity of this land should continue to be treasured as our special attribute. However, education, being a subject in the Concurrent List of the Constitution, and the majority of schools being under the jurisdiction of the State Governments, it is within the ambit of the States/ Union Territories to decide about the subjects to be taught in their schools keeping in view the National Curriculum Framework (NCF).


    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Shri Upendra Kushwaha today in a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question.
