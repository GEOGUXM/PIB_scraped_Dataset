      Posted On: 17 JUL 2017 11:27PM by PIB Delhi


    The importing countries are well aware of the eco-friendliness of the Coir and Coir product. The Coir industry is very much in need of the Eco Labeling for its products which will definitely boost its marketing potential both abroad and within the country. The Coir Board has already taken up the matter of obtaining ECO MARK for coir products with the Ministry of Environment and Forest and is constantly pursuing it for finalizing the criteria for obtaining the ECO Mark.


    The Eco Mark Labeling for coir and coir products will boost the exports of these products in view of the growing affinity towards natural/eco-friendly products in the international market. The Government through the Coir Board is implementing schemes for promotion of coir in the country which also contributes to enhance export of coir and coir products. In particular, the Export Market Promotion Scheme under Coir Vikas Yojana (CVY) provides for adoption of product specific and market specific promotional activities for popularizing coir and coir products in overseas markets, supporting export oriented coir units on modernization, etc. The interventions under the Scheme also include market survey, consultancy, data sourcing, participation in international events and financial assistance to entrepreneurs to participate in international fairs.


    In addition to incentives under the Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS), Coir products are also eligible to get fiscal incentives under Duty Drawback Scheme ranging from 1 â€“ 5%.


    This Press Release is based on information given by the Minister of State for MSME Shri Giriraj Singh in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha on 17.07.2017 (Monday).
