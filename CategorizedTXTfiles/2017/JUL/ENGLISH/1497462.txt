        Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation monitors on-going Central Sector Infrastructure Projects costing Rs. 150 crore and above through On-line Computerised Monitoring System (OCMS) on time and cost overruns on the basis of information provided by the project implementing agencies.


        As on 01.04.2017, a total of 1231 projects were on the monitor of the Ministry. Of these, 327 projects were showing time overruns, 329 were showing cost overruns and 105 were showing both time and cost overruns with respect to their original project implementation schedules. Project-wise details including reasons for time and cost overruns in these projects are available at www.cspm.gov.in /publications.


        The major steps undertaken to ensure completion of Central Sector Infrastructure Projects without time and cost overruns include: rigorous project appraisal; On-line Computerized Monitoring System (OCMS) for better monitoring; setting up of Revised Cost Committees in the Ministries for fixation of responsibility for time and cost overruns; regular review of infrastructure projects by the concerned administrative Ministries; and setting up of Central Sector Projects Coordination Committees (CSPCCs) in the States under the Chief Secretaries for removal of bottlenecks and for facilitating the speedy implementation of major projects.


        This information was given by Minister for Statistics and Programme Implementation Shri D. V. Sadananda Gowda in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
