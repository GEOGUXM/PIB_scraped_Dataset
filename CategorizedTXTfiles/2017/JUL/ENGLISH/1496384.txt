    The measures taken by the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region to reach out to the States of North Eastern Region in a more proactive manner, inter alia , include:-


    i) Various officials of the Ministry regularly visit and camp in the State capitals for expediting processing of reports and Utilization Certificates by the State Governments. In respect of projects taken under the scheme of Non-Lapsable Central Pool of Resources (NLCPR), the Ministry is in constant touch with the officials concerned of the State Governments through video-conferencing and other IT tools like Whatsapp, SMSs and E-mails.


    ii) Guidelines of the Ministryâ€™s flagship scheme, Non-Lapsable Central Pool of Resources (NLCPR), have been revised to incentivize faster completion of projects taken up under the scheme.


    iii) Automation has been enabled by launching NLCPR Project Portal through which all the required documents from the State Governments are received online in the Ministry.

The number of completed projects had risen from 30 in the year 2015-16 to 76 in the year 2016-17. The fund utilisation against ongoing projects was 90% during 2016-17.
