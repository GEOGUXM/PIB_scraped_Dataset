      Posted On: 19 JUL 2017 3:35PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government of India had approved raising of 5 India Reserve Battalions for J & K Police on 10.02.2016. Subsequently State Government raised a demand to create a Women Police Battalion for J & K Police to address the issues relating to gender based violence faced by Women. Keeping in view the need raised by the State Government for creation of a Women Police Battalion for J & K Police, the State Government of J & K was asked to raise one or two Women Battalions out of the 5 India Reserve Battalions sanctioned for J & K. It was also mentioned that MHA policy is to reserve 33% seats for women; therefore, MHA would encourage J & K Government to raise 2 women battalions. However, citing that the process of recruitment of 5 India Reserve Battalions has already been set in motion, the State Government has reiterated its proposal for creation of one new exclusive Battalion for women.


    State Government of Jammu & Kashmir has issued and Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for dispersal of unlawful assemblies/crowd control in Jammu & Kashmir and use of force.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question by Smt. Renuka Chowdhury in the Rajya Sabha today.
