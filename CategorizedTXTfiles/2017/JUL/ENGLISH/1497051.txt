    The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India vide order dated 14/02/2017 directed that the Union of India shall assist the Court, in finalizing the norms, that should be adopted in the entire country, with reference to persons who have been cured of their mental illness, but are continued to be housed in mental nursing homes/hospitals.


    Pursuant to the order of the Court, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare formulated the “Guidelines for discharge of ‘mentally cured’ or ‘fit for discharge’ patients from Mental Health Institutions”.


    The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has formulated the guidelines for “Rehabilitation of Persons who have been cured of Mental Illness” and submitted the same to the Hon’ble Supreme Court.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
