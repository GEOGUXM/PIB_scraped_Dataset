      Posted On: 26 JUL 2017 6:04PM by PIB Delhi


    Government of India had approved raising of 5 India Reserve Battalions for J & K Police on 10.02.2016. Subsequently, State Government raised a demand to create a Women Police Battalion for J & K Police to address the issues relating to gender based violence faced by Women.
    
    Keeping in view the need raised by the State Government for creation of a Women Police Battalion for J & K Police, the State Government of J & K was asked to raise one or two Women Battalions out of the 5 India Reserve Battalions sanctioned for J & K. It was also mentioned that MHA policy is to reserve 33% seats for women; therefore, MHA would encourage J & K Government to raise 2 women battalions. However, citing that the process of recruitment of 5 India Reserve Battalions has already been set in motion, the State Government has reiterated its proposal for creation of one new exclusive Battalion for women.
    
    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question by Shri Ripun Bora in the Rajya Sabha today.
