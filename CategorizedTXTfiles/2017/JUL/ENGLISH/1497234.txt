      Posted On: 26 JUL 2017 5:00PM by PIB Delhi


    All States were requested to send the priority list during the year 2016-17 of the estimated expenditure three times the normative allocation. The State Government of Assam has given 15 projects costing Rs. 580.70 crore out of which 13 projects costing Rs. 569.71 crore have been retained/sanctioned under NLCPR scheme. Priority list for the current financial year has not been obtained from any State.
    
    A total of 203 projects under NLCPR are at different stages of implementation.
    
    The amount of funds allocated and released under NLCPR scheme during the last three years i.e. 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17 are Rs.151.15 crore, Rs.165.69 crore and Rs.152.21 crore respectively.
    
    During the year 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17, the State Government of Assam submitted priority list for 111 projects, 51 projects and 15 projects respectively. As cost of the proposals exceeded three times its normative allocation, the State Government was requested to re-prioritize these projects and accordingly most of the re-prioritized projects have been retained and sanctioned. Some projects could not be sanctioned including those pertaining to completion of balance works.
    
    This was stated by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question by Shri Ram Prasad Sarmah in the Lok Sabha today.
