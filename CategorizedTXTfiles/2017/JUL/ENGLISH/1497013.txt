    In a major recruitment drive for filling up faculty positions at AIIMS, Bhopal, 116 candidates (Professor-14, Associate Professor-34, Assistant Professor-58) have been empanelled recently for 36 Departments. The existing strength of regular faculty is 53. This addition is expected to give a big boost to the health care services at the Institute. It would be possible to add soon health care services in 14 new Specialty Departments as against existing 22 Departments functional today.


    The recruitment exercise for faculty members for another 5 Departments is also in advance stage.


    In all, 251 faculty positions in 41 Departments were advertised, against which, 1561 applications were received. The interviews were conducted in three phases over a period of almost three months.


    Filling up of the vacant positions was on hold earlier because of a stay by the Court, which has since been lifted enabling the recruitment process to be conducted.
