      Posted On: 28 JUL 2017 5:21PM by PIB Delhi


    On account of implementation of GST there may be instances where the retail sale price printed on a pre-packaged commodity is required to be changed. The Department has issued an order according to which, manufacturers/ packers/ importers of pre-packaged commodities are allowed to declare the revised retail sale price (MRP), by way of stamping or putting sticker or online printing, as the case may be, on the unsold stock manufactured/ packed/ imported prior to 1st July, 2017, if any, in addition to the existing retail sale price (MRP), for three months i.e. upto 30th September, 2017. Use of un-exhausted packaging material/ wrapper has also been allowed upto 30th September, 2017 after making the necessary corrections.

    
    Further, vide this advisory, it has been informed that for reducing the Retail Sale Price (MRP), a sticker with the revised lower MRP (inclusive of all taxes) may be affixed and the same shall not cover the MRP declaration made by the manufacturer or the packer, as the case may be, on the label of the package.
    
    Therefore, declaration of the revised retail sale price (MRP) on the pre-packaged commodities, by way of stamping or putting sticker or online printing, as the case may be, has already been allowed where on account of implementation of GST, the retail sale price of a pre-packaged commodity is required to be changed/ revised.
    
    This information was given by Shri C. R. Chaudhary, the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha, today.
