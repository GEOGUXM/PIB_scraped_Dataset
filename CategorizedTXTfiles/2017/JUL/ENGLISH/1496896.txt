        The schemes/ programmes are implemented for socio-economic development of tribals in the country, including tribal women. The schemes are demand driven. The beneficiaries are selected by the State concerned. Gender disaggregated data of funds/ beneficiaries are not maintained centrally. States have been emphasized in Project Appraisal Committee Meetings that one third beneficiaries should be women / girls. Scheme of Strengthening of Education in low literacy Districts is meant for girls only. Further under the guidelines of Eklavya Model Residential Schools, it is specified that the number of seats for girls and boys will be equal.
