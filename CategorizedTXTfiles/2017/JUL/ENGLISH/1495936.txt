      Posted On: 18 JUL 2017 3:11PM by PIB Delhi


    National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) has been subsumed under National Health Mission (NHM). The Budgetary Estimate (BE) under National Health Mission (NHM) is Rs. 21,940.70 Crore for the F.Y. 2017-18.


    The Ministry pays attention to the fact that the States where there is acute shortage of basic health facilities are allocated more funds at the time of budget allocation. In this regard, it may be noted that under NHM, annual resource envelope of a State is decided based on its population and a weight-age factor which depends on area of the State, health lag / socio-economic backwardness.


    The formula approved for the allocation of funds is given below:
