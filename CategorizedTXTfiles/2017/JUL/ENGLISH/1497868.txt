    A delegation of Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), led by its President Shri Pankaj Patel met the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today and discussed with him the possibilities of industrial collaboration in Space projects.

    
    The FICCI President briefed Dr Jitendra Singh about his meeting with ISRO Chairman Shri Shri A S Kiran Kumar and said that the entire Indian industry is elated at the successful launch of the first - ever "South Asia Satellite", as well as other landmark achievements in recent years, particularly in the last three months.
    
    Shri Pankaj Patel informed Dr Jitendra Singh that, inspired by these recent milestones of India’s Space Programme, the companies operating in aerospace domain are keen to expand their business in Space segment. In addition, he said, the enabling policies of the Central Government have also encouraged them to explore the possibilities of engaging in the commercial Space segment.
    
    Dr Jitendra Singh said that India’s Space achievements are a vindication of the struggle by founding fathers like Vikram Sarabhai and Satish Dhawan. As we move forward and extend our Space Technology applications in every field, ranging from housing to road construction, tele-education to tele-medicine, etc., it is but obvious that the range of our collaboration will also expand, he said. It is in such a scenario where the role of industrial bodies like FICCI becomes crucial, he observed.
    
    Dr Jitendra Singh noted with pride that India today stands as world’s frontline nation in Space Technology. This, he said, is evident from the fact that several of our inputs and scientific conclusions including the pictures of Mars taken by the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) are being procured by NASA and other leading Space Centers of the World.
