    Minister of State (I/C) for Youth Affairs and Sports Shri Vijay Goel here today flagged off the 10th Slum Yuva Daud with Union Minister for Roadways and Transport Shri Nitin Gadkari and Shri Maheish Girri MP. Today’s Daud started from Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital, Khichdipur and ended at Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar Stadium, Trilokpuri. More than 5000 youth from various Delhi slums participated and each of them was awarded medals, t-shirts and certificates.

    
    Shri Goel interacted with the participants before the daud started and each of them gave him a positive feedback and appreciated the Ministry’s efforts to provide them a platform like this. Some of the youngsters shared their ideas while some sang patriotic songs. Addressing the participants Shri Goel said, “Our aim is to provide the youth of slum something positive so that they do not take to drugs or other anti-social activities. We will also prepare teams in future and hold competitions in football, volleyball etc. so that we are able to find the hidden talent from these slums”.
    
    Shri Nitin Gadkari praised the initiative of Slum Yuva Daud and said, “Youth has tremendous energy and they must use it to transform India into “New India”. Shri Mahesih Girri interacted with the participants and stated, “Such activities empower the youth and they feel elated. This will surely help us in building Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat”.
    
    The Slum Yuva Daud is part of the Adopt Slum Campaign initiated by the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports and Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan. Total 10 Slum Yuva Runs have been organized across Delhi so far with mass participation of youth from various Delhi slums.
