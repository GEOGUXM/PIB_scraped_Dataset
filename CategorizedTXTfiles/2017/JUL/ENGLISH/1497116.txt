      Except the 5 B-777 LR aircrafts which have been sold, all other aircrafts are in service/operations. The 5 B-777 LR aircrafts were sold in order to rationalize the fleet and reduce operational losses.


      Out of the 23 B-787 aircrafts, 21 B-787 Dreamliner aircrafts have been acquired under the Sale and Lease Back Arrangement (SLB) and the remaining 2 aircrafts have been procured under Bridge Loans till their SLB financing is finalized. As per the Turnaround Plan approved by the Govt for Air India, these aircraft were to be procured by AI under SLB arrangement.
