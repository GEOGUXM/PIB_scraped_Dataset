      Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India invites comments from public on the Regulations notified under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.
      Posted On: 06 JUL 2017 7:20PM by PIB Delhi


        The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 ( Code ) is a modern economic legislation . Section 240 of the Code empowers the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India ( IBBI ) to make regulations subject to the conditions that the regulations : ( a ) carry out the provisions of the Code, ( b ) are consistent with the Code and the rules made thereunder; ( c ) are made by a notification published in the official gazette; and ( d ) are laid, as soon as possible, before each House of Parliament for 30 days .


        The IBBI has evolved a transparent and consultative process to make regulations . It has been endeavor of the IBBI to effectively engage stakeholders in the regulation making process . The process generally starts with a working group making draft regulations . The IBBI puts these draft regulations out in public domian seeking comments threon . It holds a few round tables to discuss draft regulations with the stakeholders . It takes advice of its Advisory Committee . The process culminates with the Governing Board of the IBBI finalising regulations and the IBBI notifies them . This process endevours to factor in ground reality, secures ownership of regulations and makes regulations robust and precise, relevant to the time and for the purpose .


        Public consultation enables collective choice and hence plays an important role in evolution of regulatory framework . The participation of the public, particularly the stakeholders and the regulated, in the regulatory process ensures that the regulations are informed by the legitimate needs of those interested in and affected by regulations .


        Usually, a regulator prepares draft regulations and presents these to the stakeholders to revalidate its understanding of the issue the said regulations seek to address, and the appropriateness of such regulations to address the issue . Based on the inputs from the stakeholders, the regulator finalizes the regulations with modifications, as may be warranted . The IBBI has been essentially following this approach and will continue to do so .


        Despite the best of efforts and intentions, a regulator may not always have the understanding of the ground realities, as much and as early as the stakeholders and the regulated may have, particularly in a dynamic environment . The stakeholders could, therefore, play a more active role in making regulations . They may contemplate, at leisure, the important issues in the extant regulatory framework that hinder transactions and offer alternate solutions to address them, in addition to responding urgently to draft regulations proposed by the regulator . This is akin to crowdsourcing of ideas . This would enable every idea to reach the regulator . Consequently, the universe of ideas available with the regulator would be much larger and the possibility of a more conducive regulatory framework much higher .


        Keeping in view the above, the IBBI invites comments from public, including the stakeholders and the regulated, on the regulations already notified under the Code . The comments received between 4 th July, 2017 and 31 st December, 2017 shall be processed together and following the due process, regulations will be modified to the extent considered necessary . It will be the endeavor of the IBBI to notify modified regulations by 31 st March, 2018 and bring them into force on 1 st April, 2018 .


        It is clarified that t his is in addition to the extant approach of inviting public comments on draft regulations before notifying them .
