      Posted On: 26 JUL 2017 4:54PM by PIB Delhi


    The establishment of an Air Freight Corridor between India and Afghanistan was discussed during the visits of President Ghani of Afghanistan to India in September and December 2016.
    
    The first cargo flight from Kabul to Delhi, establishing air freight corridor, was received on 19 June 2017 by the External Affairs Minister in the presence of Civil Aviation Minister and Minister of State for External Affairs and the Ambassador of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to India. Subsequently, cargo flight from Kandahar to Delhi arrived on June 24, 2017.
    
    The connectivity established through the Air Freight Corridor will promote bilateral trade; provide Afghanistan, a landlocked country, direct access to India; allow Afghan businessmen to leverage Indiaâ€™s economic growth and trade networks for its benefit; and enable Afghan farmers quick and direct access to the Indian markets for their perishable produce.
    
    This information was given by Shri Gen. (Dr.) V.K. Singh (Retd), the Minister of State for External Affairs, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha, today.
