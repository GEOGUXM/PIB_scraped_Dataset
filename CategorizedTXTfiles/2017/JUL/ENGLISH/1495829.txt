      Anti-Dumping Duty on Steel Imports
      Posted On: 17 JUL 2017 5:48PM by PIB Delhi


        The Government had imposed anti-dumping duty ranging from 4.58% to 57.39% of landed value on Cold Rolled Flat Products of Stainless Steel from China, Korea, European Union, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand and USA on 17.04.2014.


        Anti-dumping duty on the above items were further extended by five more years as per Government notification dated 11.12.2015. After a sunset review, it was found that:-


        (i) there is continued dumping of these goods from above mentioned countries/territories though the volume of imports has declined;


        (ii) the performance of the domestic industry has deteriorated in the current injury period due to the impact of the dumped imports from these countries; and


        (iii) the dumping is likely to continue and the performance of the domestic industry is likely to deteriorate, if the anti-dumping duty is revoked.


        Anti-dumping duty is imposed on the basis of margin of dumping which can vary across countries, producers or exporters. Accordingly, there are variable rates of anti-dumping duty on different exporting countries, producers or exporters. Details of country-wise duty imposed are given below-
