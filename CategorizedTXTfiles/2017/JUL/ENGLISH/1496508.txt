        The increase in operating surplus has been due to improvement in operational efficiency of major ports on account of modernization, mechanization, acquisition and use of latest technology, deepening of drafts to handle large vessels etc. In addition , a study on benchmarking of efficiency and productivity of major ports to international levels has been carried out to improve the operations and efficiency of the major ports. The study has identified a total of 106 port wise action points/initiatives of which 81 initiatives have already been completed. These implemented initiatives have also resulted in improved efficiency and additional operating surplus.
