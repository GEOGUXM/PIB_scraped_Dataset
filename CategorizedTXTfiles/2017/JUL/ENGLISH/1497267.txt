      Open border of India and Nepal
      Posted On: 26 JUL 2017 6:03PM by PIB Delhi


    Indo-Nepal border is open, porous and thickly populated. The movement of Indian and Nepalese citizens across the Indo-Nepal border is governed by Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship, 1950, which provides for free movement of citizens of both the countries across the border. To prevent misuse of border by anti-social elements including terrorists/criminals, Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) has been deployed at Indo-Nepal Border as a Border Guarding Force. SSB regularly carries out various operational activities like patrolling and laying of nakas along the border. Checking of persons crossing the border is also being carried out both randomly as well as on the basis of specific inputs received from SSBâ€™s own sources/sister agencies.
    
    Besides, State Police concerned is also keeping vigil. Issues of security concerns are also addressed through institutional interactions with Nepal on a regular basis. These mechanisms include Home Secretary Level talks, Joint Working Group on Border Management, Director General (Customs) level talks and bilateral consultative group on security issues.
    
    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question by Shri Prabhat Jha in the Rajya Sabha today.
