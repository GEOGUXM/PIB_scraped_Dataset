    The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee has strongly condemned the terrorist attack on Amarnath Yatris in Anantnag district of Jammu and Kashmir last night.


    In a message to Shri N.N. Vohra, Governor of Jammu and Kashmir , the President has said " I am deeply shocked and anguished to learn about the cowardly attack on Amarnath Yatris in Anantnag district of Jammu and Kashmir in which a number of innocent pilgrims lost their lives and several others were injured.


    Such senseless acts of terrorism targeting innocent lives is an attack on the democratic values of society and deserve to be universally condemned. They must be met with determination and collective action. I call upon the State Government and all concerned agencies to ensure that the guilty are brought to justice and law and order is maintained in the State. I am sure necessary steps are being taken to provide all possible aid to the bereaved families who have lost their near and dear ones as well as medical assistance to the injured.


    Please convey my heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased. I also wish the injured persons speedy recovery ".
