        As is evident from Table above, the demand for AYUSH products is gradually increasing in foreign countries.


        Notwithstanding, the fact of gradual growth, to further increase the pace of export, the Ministry of AYUSH offers incentives to the AYUSH industry under its Central Sector Scheme for International Cooperation (i) to get market authorization/ registration for their product(s) at regulatory bodies of different countries such as USFDA/EMEA/UK-MHRA/ NHPD/ TGA etc. to enhance their exports (ii) for participation in international exhibitions, trade fairs, road shows etc. to create awareness about the efficacy of their products.


        In addition to the above, for facilitating exports, Ministry of AYUSH encourages following certifications of AYUSH products as per details below:-


        (i) Voluntary Quality Certification of Pharmaceutical Products (CoPP) under WHO Guidelines


        (ii) Quality Certifications Scheme implemented by the Quality Council of India (QCI) for grant of AYUSH Premium mark to Ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani products on the basis of third party evaluation of quality in accordance with the status of compliance to international standards.


        Besides, Department of Commerce, Ministry of Commerce and Industry provides support for enhancing export of traditional medicines through Pharmexcil by giving opportunity to small and medium scale companies for facilitating business meetings and also providing a global platform to showcase their products. Pharmexcil organises Buyer-Sellers and Reverse Buyer-Sellers Meets focused on AYUSH and AYUSH related products.


        This information was given by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) for AYUSH, Shri Shripad Yesso Naik in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
