      Privatization of Airports
      Posted On: 20 JUL 2017 7:13PM by PIB Delhi


    Passenger safety and benefit of the airports operated by private/JVC entities are governed as per the Concession Agreement and applicable laws in the country. The regulator authorities i.e. DGCA and Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India are mandated to monitor the performance of the Airports in this regard.
    
    No airport in the country has been fully privatized. However, Airports Authority of India (AAI) has entrusted the Joint Venture Company (JVC), the Operation Management and Development of Delhi and Mumbai airports under Public Private Partnership (PPP) to have world class airport infrastructure in the country. AAI holds 26% equity in JVCs of Delhi and Mumbai. Presently, the airports being managed under the PPP model includes Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Cochin and Hyderabad. Introduction of PPP at these airports has led to significant improvement in the infrastructures, rise in collection of revenues and airport service quality, etc. These airports constantly figure among the top five airports in the global ranking in their respective categories.
    
    This information was given by the Minister of State for Civil Aviation Shri Jayant Sinha in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
