      Inoperative EPF Accounts
      Posted On: 24 JUL 2017 3:29PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government vide notification no. G.S.R. 1065 (E) dated 11.11.2016 has amended paragraph 72(6) of the Employees’ Provident Funds (EPF) Scheme, 1952 wherein changes have been made in the conditions leading to a Provident Fund (PF) account becoming an Inoperative Account. As per amended definition of Inoperative Account (w.e.f. 11.11.2016), an account becomes inoperative after the age of 58 years, i.e., 36 months after the retirement age of 55 years. The details of inoperative accounts and amounts involved therein, consequent upon implementation of the above notification, have not been ascertained by Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) presently as the date of birth in respect of many employees is not available in the EPFO database presently.


    As per paragraph 60(6) of EPF Scheme, 1952, interest shall not be credited to the account of a member from the date on which it has become an inoperative account under paragraph 72(6) of EPF Scheme, 1952. However, as per amended definition, an account shall be classified as Inoperative after the member attains the age of 58 years. Hence, interest shall be credited to the account of a member upto the age of 58 years.


    This information was given by Shri Bandaru Dattatreya the Minister of State (IC) for Labour and Employment, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha, today.
