    The Petrapole-Benapole Integrated Check Post is a major route for India-Bangladesh bilateral trade. In order to facilitate movement of cargo across the border, India and Bangladesh have agreed to operate Petrapole-Benapole ICP 24x7, with effect from 01st August 2017. Land Ports Authority of India (LPAI) and Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), the implementing agencies on the Indian side, have issued necessary instructions in this regard.
    
    The 24x7 operationalization of Petrapole-Benapole ICP is expected to be a significant milestone towards expeditious clearance of cargo and, hence boost the bilateral trade between the two countries.
