      Posted On: 20 JUL 2017 5:53PM by PIB Delhi


    At present, there is no scheme of Government of India that provides compensation in respect of Indian nationals dying abroad.


    However, there is a mandatory insurance scheme, the Pravasi Bharatiya Bima Yojana for emigrant workers who need Emigrance Clearance for overseas employment. The scheme has been further strengthened recently which will be beneficial to Indian emigrant workers. The scheme provides an insurance cover of 10 lakhs in case of death or permanent disability and a few other limited benefits at a nominal insurance premium of Rs. 275 and Rs. 375 for a period of two and three years respectively.


    This information was given by GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD) the Minister of State for Ministry of External Affairs., in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
