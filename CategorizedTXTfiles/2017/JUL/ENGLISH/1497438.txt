      Technical Problem in A320 Neo Aircraft
      Posted On: 27 JUL 2017 5:03PM by PIB Delhi


    The delivery of A 320 Neo aircraft to Indian operators started in the first quarter of the year 2016. Subsequently, operators have started facing problem with the PW 1100G-JM engine fitted on these aircrafts due to bearing seal plate wearing and combustion chamber distress.


    Both M/s Indigo and M/s Go Air have confirmed that these issues have impacted the delivery of aircraft. Further, Air India has also experienced delay in deliveries of some A320 Neo aircrafts fitted with CFM Leap 1A26 engines by few days due to non-availability of engines at Airbus facility.


    The manufacturer has informed the Directorate General of Civil Aviation about addressing the bearing and combustion chamber distress problem.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Civil Aviation Shri Jayant Sinha in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
