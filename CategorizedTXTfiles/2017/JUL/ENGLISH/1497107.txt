      Posted On: 25 JUL 2017 5:44PM by PIB Delhi


    As per reports of agencies, the demonetisation of bank notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 denomination resulted in significant positive impact on most theatres of violence in the country.


    Since illegally held cash forms the major chunk of terrorist funding, after the demonetisation, most of the cash held with the terrorists turned worthless. Demonetisation also led to instant extinguishment of Pak-printed high quality fake Indian currency notes. It also adversely affected the hawala operators.


    As per the data provided by NCRB, the denomination wise fake Indian currency notes seized in J & K after demonetisation i.e. from 09.11.2016 to 14.07.2017 are as under:-
