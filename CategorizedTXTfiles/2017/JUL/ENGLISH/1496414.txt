Left out areas in phase 1  The proposal is being prepared and will be submitted to CWC for appraisal by 31.7.2017.                 
                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                   

    This would also affect the initial allocation of water between the two States as per the 2005 agreement. It was therefore, decided that both the State Governments should work out an agreement on mutual water sharing to take KBLP forward. The implementation of KBLP would be taken up once the two States have reached an agreement on water sharing.


    No area of land turned barren due to lack of irrigation in Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh during period has been reported to the Ministry.
