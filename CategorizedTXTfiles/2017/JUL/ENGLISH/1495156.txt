    The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee has extended his greetings and felicitations to the Government and people of the Republic of Kiribati on the eve of their Independence Day (July 12, 2017).


    In a message to His Excellency Taneti Mamau, the President of the Republic of Kiribati , the President has said, “ On behalf of the Government, the people of India and on my own behalf, I convey my best wishes and greetings to Your Excellency, the Government and people of the Republic of Kiribati on the occasion of your nation’s Independence Day.


    India and Kiribati have traditionally enjoyed warm and cordial relations based on mutual respect, goodwill and mutual understanding. India continues to support Kiribati and other Pacific Island Countries in their development needs. I am glad that Kiribati participated in the India-Pacific Islands Sustainable Development Conference hosted by India’s Minister of State for External Affairs in Suva from 25-26 May 2017. I am confident that the deliberations on sustainable development, Blue Economy, health care, climate change, renewable energy and disaster risk reduction will help Kiribati to identify sectors in which India and Kiribati can enhance co- operation for the benefit of our two peoples.


    I take this opportunity to convey to Your Excellency my best wishes for your good health and well-being, as well as for the progress and prosperity of the friendly people of Kiribati”.
