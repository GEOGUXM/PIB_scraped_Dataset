    Dr Jitendra Singh appreciated the role played by ICC in collaborating to hold the GST awareness programmes.

The Minister also disclosed that during the last one year, a number of investment offers for Northeast have been forthcoming. These, he said, include offers given from some of the potential investors from abroad also.
    
    Calling upon the Indian Chamber of Commerce and other leading trade organisations of India to encourage entrepreneurship in Northeast, Dr Jitendra Singh said, in the last two to three years, a number of incentives and facilitatory provisions have been introduced by the Ministry of DoNER and North Eastern Council (NEC). He said, with the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi led Government’s focus on ‘Act East’ policy, the business avenues of North Eastern States have found an extension beyond the borders in the form of trade prospects emerging with countries like Myanmar, Bhutan and Bangladesh.
