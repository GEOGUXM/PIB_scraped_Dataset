    In line with the direction of the Honâ€™ble Supreme Court and National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, which has been implemented in all States & UTs and covers about 81 crore beneficiaries for receiving food grains, Department in association with States/UTs is implementing the installation of electronic Point of Sale (e-PoS) devices for the biometric authentication of and distribution of the subsidised foodgrains to eligible beneficiaries. e-PoS devices facilitate the authentication of beneficiaries (preferably Aadhaar based), recording of sales to beneficiaries electronically and uploading of sale transactions data in a central server.


    Out of 5.27 lakh FPSs across the country, 2,45,706 FPSs have been automated so far. As a result of FPS automation, the State/UT Governments are able to reduce ghost lifting and achieve rightful targeting of food subsidies. The progress made so far towards Aadhaar Seeding and FPSs automation (State-wise) is given in the table below.
