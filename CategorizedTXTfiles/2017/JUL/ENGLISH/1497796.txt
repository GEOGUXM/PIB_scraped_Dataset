    The Government today informed that it has taken various steps to check distress migration. Replying to a question in the Rajya Sabha, the Minister of State for Rural Development Shri Ram Kripal Yadav said that the Ministry has been taken steps like giving additional 50 days of unskilled employment under MGNREGA to drought affected areas. During 2016-17, seven drought affected States were allowed 150 days of work under MGNREGA. In the current year Kerala and Puducherry have already been given this provision. He said that the Ministry is also developing rural clusters under Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission, with the objective of bridging the rural-urban divide and reducing migration from rural to urban areas.


    The Minister also informed that a study conducted by Ministry through independent evaluators has reported that Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) has resulted in reduction of seasonal migration. Other studies also indicated direct and positive impact of MGNREGA in reduction of distress migration by providing work closer to home and decent working conditions. He said that the gist of such studies has been brought out by the Ministry in a publication named ‘MGNREGA Sameeksha’.


    Further, on the recommendation of Ministry of Rural Development, National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj (NIRD&PR) has commissioned two studies on migration, namely, Impact of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme on Distress Migration: A study of selected states of India and Impact of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act on the Migration of Tribal Folk: A Case Study in Junglemahal districts of West Bengal.
