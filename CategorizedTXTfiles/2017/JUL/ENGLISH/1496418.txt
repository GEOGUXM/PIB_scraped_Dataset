The Tribunal forwarded a report in January, 1987.

The matter is subjudice before Tribunal.


    Meanwhile, the State of Punjab. enacted the Punjab Termination of-Agreements Act, 2004 (PTAA) on 12.07.2004 terminating and discharging the Government of Punjab from its obligations under the agreement dated 31.12.1981 and all other agreements relating to waters of Ravi-Beas. A Presidential Reference in the matter was filed by Union of India on July 22, 2004 seeking the opinion of the Hon'ble Supreme Court on Constitutional validity of the PTAA 2004.
