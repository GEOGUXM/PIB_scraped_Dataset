      As per the World Bankâ€™s Migration and Development Brief 27 (April 2017), for the first time in recent history, remittance flows to developing countries registered a decline for two successive years. India, the largest remittance-receiving country worldwide, led the fall with a decrease of 8.9 per cent in remittance inflows. Low oil prices and weak economic growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries is one of the major reasons for the fall in remittances.


      The services sector is the major sector of the Indian economy in terms of the share in total GVA as can be seen in the following table.
