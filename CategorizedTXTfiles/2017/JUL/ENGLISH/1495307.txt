    These workshops are designed in a manner to ensure that the police officials understand and realise the importance of their role in effective enforcement of IPRs. These workshops includes vide range of topics including counterfeiting and piracy. To ensure effective participation of police officials, various interactive activities like quizzes, skit, IP videos, and case studies etc. are also made part of the workshop besides the regular lecture sessions.
    
    Further, CIPAM has also prepared an IPR Enforcement toolkit for the Police. This toolkit is a ready reckoner for police officials across the country in dealing with IP crimes, specifically Trade Marks counterfeiting and Copyright piracy which is a huge menace to the IP owners not only in India but globally. In addition to details of criminal offences related to these IPs, toolkit also provides checklists for registering a complaint and conducting search and seizures. It also gives suggestive guidelines for search and seizure in case of IP crimes. Toolkit has been disseminated to all State Police Departments and major industry associations across the nation. Toolkit will be an effective tool assisting the enforcement agencies in dealing with the cases relating to Trademarks and Copyrights infringement.
