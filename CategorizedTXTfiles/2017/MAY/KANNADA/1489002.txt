    Brief for the Review on 02.05.2017 by Hon'ble UDM of the Progress of Missions/Schemes of the Ministry of Urban Development in


    Karnataka


    1. Atal Mission for Urban Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT)


    • I have reviewed the Atal Mission for Urban Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation. This Mission will usher in a big change in the delivery of basic citizen services which are very important for quality of life in the cities.


    • The Government of India has approved all the three plan for Karnataka as well as for other States in the country too. With this every State has full clarity about the funds that are likely to flow to them as well as their tasks under the Mission.


    • For Karnataka the three State Annual Action Plans total up to Rs 4953 Cr. Out of this, Rs 2319 Cr will come from Government of India as Central Assistance.


    • The empowerment the Mission has done to the States is very important for them to implement the projects faster. With approval of the State Plan, the States have full freedom, to prepare DPRs,. appraise and approve them, and then implement the projects.


    • The State has taken important steps in implementation of the projects. Out of the total plans of Rs 4953 Cr approved for the State, projects costing Rs 2494 have already started on ground. Out of the balance, DPRs for the projects amounting to Rs 536 Cr have been approved. The State has targeted start all the projects under the Mission by November this year. This quick starting of the, projects will help States complete them faster and the benefits from these projects will reach the citizens.


    • A total of 134 projects will be competed 25 by December 2017, 178 projects will be competed 50 by Dec 2018 and all projects will be completed by February 2020.


    • The States has estimated that a total of 20,45,990 (under AMRUT 2,51,505) tap connections will be given in the cities to supply quality drinking water once the Mission is completed in 2020.


    2. Swachh Bharat Mission


    • It is heartening to know that Karnataka state has recently (24th March 2017) increased its contribution towards IHHL to Rs. 11000 from Rs. 1300. Currently only 3 cities (Mysuru, Mangalore, Udupi) out of 276 are ODF in Karnataka, the increase in the state share will result in more cities becoming ODF. The state is aiming for 97 cities to be ODF by 2nd October 2017 and entire state by October 2018.


    • The capital city, Bengaluru will be ODF by 31st August 2017.


    • As far as Solid waste management in Bangalore is concerned, am pleased to know that the Karnataka government has involved Agricultural department of the state to directly market and sell the. Compost produced through Raitu Sampark Kendra. This is a good example of convergence which other cities should also. look at. The agricultural department has been advised to avail market development assistance of Rs. 1500/- per' MT given by Government of India.


    • 4 Waste to Compost plants out of 8 in Bengaluru are not functional due to non-disposal of RDF. The state administration has been advised to expedite the process of setting up of 2 Waste to Energy plants to resolve the issue. Government of India has amended India electricity act to make waste to energy projects viable on PPP mode by allowing 100 off take of electricity generated from Waste to Energy plants.


    • As far as other cities of Karnataka are concerned, it was suggested to expedite the process of setting up of Waste to compost plants in 15 AMRUT town'S and waste to energy projects in Mysuru and Hubli- Dharwad.


    • 8engaluru, Mangalore & Mysuru have high level of efficiency in segregating household waste at source. On 5th June 2017, when all the cities in the country will start segregation at source, I request other cities of Karnataka to also join.


    • Karnataka state has availed 205 Cr, including 36 Cr, which I am releasing today out of 1020 Cr available as central government share. I urge the state to draw their entitlement at the earliest. The state has assured to submit a proposal to MoUD in the third week of May.


    3. Smart Cities.Mission


    • There are six smart cities selected from Karnataka, viz- Belagave, Davanagere, Hubballo-Dharwad, Mangaluru, Shivamogga & Tumakuru. 8engaluru has participated in Round 3 of the SCM Challenge.


    • Rs 200 Cr each has been released to 8elagavi arid Davanagere, in August 2016, I am handing over the sanction of Rs 107 Cr each for the remaining cities today.


    • All the cities have formed the Special Purpose Vehicles to implement the Smart City projects and 3 cities (8elagavi, Davanagere and Tumakuru) have appointed the Project Management Consultant for end to end projectivisation. Remaining cities are in the process of finalizing project management consultants.


    • The cities have identified impactful projects such as, Command & Control Centre, Lake Rejuvenation, (Belagavi, Tumakuru), Riverfront Development (Shivarnoqqa), Integration with BRTS (Hubballi-Dharwad), Piped Natural Gas Distribution (Belagavi, Tumakuru, Hubballi-Dharwad), Mandakki Bhatti Area Development (Davanagere) and Adaptive Reuse of Old Tile Factory (Mangaluru).


    • DPRs prepared for 10 projects, However, there is delay in tendering for want of delegation of power to SPVs. As per Articles of Association, the financial power of SPV is restricted to Rs 10 Cr in Karnataka.


    • The best performing cities such as Bhopal, Pune, Bhubaneshwar, Ahmedabad, have given full financial autonomy to the SPVs. I would request the State Government of Karnataka to provide full financial autonomy to the SPVs for fast tracking project implementation.


    • It is also requested that appointment of Key Manageria Professionals & Staffing of all SPVs to be expited.


    • I have reviewed the project progress of Smart Cities . The cities have identified projects to be tendered on fast track in next 3 months. I am sure that this timeline will be adhered to by the cities.


    4. HRIDAY


    • HRIDAY was launched in January 2015, as a pilot phase for 47 months. 12 cities were identified allover India (Ajmer, Amaravati, Amritsar, Badami, Dwarka, Gaya, Kanchipuram, Mathura, Puri, Varanasi, Velankanni and Warangal)


    • The scheme supports development of core heritage linked civic infrastructure projects to rejuvenate the heritage character of the city.


    • Badami from the state of Karnataka, has been included in the scheme with a budgetary outlay of Rs 22.26 Cr, out of which Rs 20.00 Cr has been earmarked for Project Implementation.


    • Detailed Project Reports for 4 projects were approved by the Ministry amounting to Rs. 18.67 Cr and released Rs 3.73 Cr to the city as first instalment.


    • The approved DPRs focuses on facade up-liftment of vernacular houses in old town, development of roads, footpath, directional and information signage, arch gateway etc.


    • 3 DPRs are tendered for contractor selection. Out of which one contractor have been selected, contractor for the remaining 2 projects will be selected by end of May' 17.
