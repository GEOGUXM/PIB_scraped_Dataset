      Union Minister of Youth Affairs & Sports Shri Vijay Goel undertook a visit to Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium here today, where the Asian Wrestling Championship 2017 is being held. He had earlier visited Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, National Stadium and Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Swimming Pool.
      
      The Minister was informed by the Administrator that as per the condition of the booking of various facilities in Indira Gandhi stadium, it is the responsibility of the organizers to keep the premises clean from the date of taking over, till the handing over of the stadium.
      
      The Minister directed that from now on, the Sports Authority of India (SAI) should not depend on organizers, but should look after the cleanliness work on their own. Interacting with the media, Shri Goel said, “When an international event is held, the players and others go back with the impression about India and not about various agencies involved.”
      
      Shri Goel added that the maintenance and sustenance of the stadia has to be throughout the year and should not be event-specific.
