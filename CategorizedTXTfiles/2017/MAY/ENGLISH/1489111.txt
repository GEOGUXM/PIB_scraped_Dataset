    The Steel Policy 2017 will give a concrete shape to the future plans and policies for steel industry in India. We have taken a holistic and comprehensive view of the steel sector in India and its key growth drivers to ensure sustainable growth of all segments of the industry. Thrust areas in the Policy include raw material securitization, import substitution, increasing production efficiency and enhancing steel consumption. I am confident that the Policy will make the Indian steel sector more vibrant and competitive, and facilitate taking the steel industry to new heights of success.“
