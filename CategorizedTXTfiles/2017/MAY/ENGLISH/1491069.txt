    General Bipin Rawat, Chief of the Army Staff is on a four days visit to Myanmar from 28 to 31 May 2017. During the visit General Bipin Rawat is scheduled to meet a number of high ranking dignitaries of Myanmar to include HE Aung San Suu Kyi, Union Minister for Foreign Affairs and State Counsellor, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services and Vice Senior General Soe Win, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services and Commander-in-Chief of Army.
    
    Myanmar is an important neighbour with whom we have historical ties and traditional bonds of friendship and cooperation based on mutual trust and understanding. During the visit General Rawat will also visit National Defence College, Nay Pyi Taw and Defence Services Academy, Pwin Oo Lwin. General Rawat is likely to address student officers of National Defence College which is a premier institution grooming the future senior leadership of Myanmar Defence Services. This visit is yet another milestone to reach out to our neighbourhood in the field of defence cooperation and build upon existing mutual cooperation and trust between the two nations.
