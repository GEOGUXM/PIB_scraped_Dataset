      Mt Ladakhi is a snow clad peak perched at an altitude of 5345m in the Pir Panjal ranges in Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh. The merger of Pir Panjal and Dhauladhar ranges which enhances the beauty of the Beas Kund basin is in the near vicinity. Ladakhi Peak is technically a challenging peak which would require all the mountaineering skill and expertise for a successful attempt. Pre expedition preparation like use of mountaineering equipment and walking on snow and ice is a must for success of the expedition.
      
      The expedition will help imbibe the qualities of courage, comradeship, discipline, leadership and a spirit of adventure amongst the NCC cadets.
