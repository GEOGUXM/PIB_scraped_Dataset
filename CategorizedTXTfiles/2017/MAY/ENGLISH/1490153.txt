      Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu, Minister for Information & Broadcasting, Urban Development, Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation has condoled the sudden demise of Shri Anil Madhav Dave, Minister for Environment, Forest & Climate Change.


      In his condolence message Shri Naidu said “I am shocked and extremely sad to know about the untimely demise of my colleague Shri Anil Madhav Dave. It is our misfortune that we lost a committed environmentalist just when he had become the Environment minister. He was in true sense a 'Son of Mother Narmada', and devoted a lifetime for the conversation of that great river. An amateur pilot, photographer and passionate reader, he was scholar in his own right. Dave wrote numerous books including his magnum opus Shivaji Aur Suraj- a study on Shivaji's good governance with a foreword by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi.


      A simple and an unassuming person, it was a joy to interact with him. He had been a Member of Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh since August, 2009. His non-partisan and level headed interventions promoted a sense of peace in the House. He was firm believer in grass root level democracy and development. He formerly edited 'Charaivety (monthly) and 'Jan Abhiyan Parishad' journal.


      He once flew a Cessna 173 aircraft along the banks of Narmada for 18 hours to complete his circumabulation in air. On another occasion he completed an insurmountable raft journey of 1312 kilometers on Narmada in 19 days. Peace be upon the 'Son of Mother Naramada'.


      Born on July 6, 1956 he shared his birthday with Jana Sangh founder Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee.”
