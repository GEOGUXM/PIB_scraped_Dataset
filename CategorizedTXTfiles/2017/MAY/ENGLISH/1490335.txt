    Minister of State (I/C) for Youth Affairs and Sports Shri Vijay Goel has said, “Rules must be in favour of players”. “If rules are a hindrance, we might change the rules because they are dedicated for the passion of sports. In a statement on C.K Vineeth controversy here today, Shri Goel added, “A player has to play continuously and hence is unable to meet the mandatory guideline. I will speak to Kerala Chief Minister and Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) office in New Delhi to seek their intervention to accommodate this player and change the rules”.
    
    The Minister reiterated that the Government is always committed to the welfare of players and their overall conditions. “I shall monitor such cases”, he stated. Shri Goel has also said that if players face any issue, he/she can directly contact him for redressal of their issues.
