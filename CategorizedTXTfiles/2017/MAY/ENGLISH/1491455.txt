      Section 285BA of the Income-tax Act, 1961 requires furnishing of a statement of financial transaction (SFT) for transactions prescribed under Rule 114E of the Income-tax Rules, 1962. The due date for filing such SFT in Form 61A in respect of specified financial transactions registered or recorded during Financial Year 2016-17 is 31st May 2017.
      
      Representations were received in the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) requesting for extension of the date of filing of the said SFT on account of the teething problems and the volume of data to be compiled. In view of these representations and in order to remove inconvenience and to facilitate ease of compliance, the CBDT, in exercise of powers conferred under section 119 of the Act, have extended the due date of furnishing of the SFT under Rule 114E (5) of the IT Rules, read with sub-section (1) of section 285BA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 in respect of specified financial transactions registered or recorded during Financial Year 2016-17, from 31st May 2017 to 30th June 2017.
