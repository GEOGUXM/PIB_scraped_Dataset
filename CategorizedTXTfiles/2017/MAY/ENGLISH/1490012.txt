    Ministry of Rural Development in partnership with the State Governments has been trying to ensure timely payment of wages to MGNREGA workers. Timely payment of wages has been a major concern. In the current financial year, 20.88 crore person days of work has been generated so far. 89.08% of wage payments have been made within 15 days of work done. Twenty two States including Puducherry received wage payment directly through National Electronic Fund Management System. The remaining States access Electronic Fund Management System in nearly all cases. The Ministry is continuously striving in partnership with States to ensure timely payment of wages to MGNREGA workers directly into their Aadhar linked Bank accounts.


    Over 85% of active MGNREGA workers have their Aadhar details seeded in NREGASOFT MIS (with their consent) and 4.85 crores workers are already on the Aadhar payment bridge linked Bank accounts.


    The thrust of the Ministry is on water conservation and States have adopted Mission Water Conservation Guidelines to focus on 2264 water stressed and irrigation deficient Blocks of the country. The evaluation of over 80 lakh hectare of water conservation work done under MGNREGA in 2015-17 has also been taken up through Institute of Economic Growth and the final report would be available by 30th September, 2017. The Ministry of Rural Development is making all efforts to create durable assets and provide employment on demand through a thrust on Mission Water Conservation.
