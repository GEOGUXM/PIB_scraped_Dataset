    The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee has extended his greetings and felicitations to the Government and people of the Cooperative Republic of Guyana on the eve of their Independence Day (May 26, 2017).
    
    In a message to His Excellency Brig. (Retd) David Arthur Granger, the President of the Cooperative Republic of Guyana, the President has said, “It gives me great pleasure to felicitate you on behalf of people and Government of India and on my own behalf on the occasion of the Independence Day of the Cooperative Republic of Guyana.
    
    Bilateral relations between India and Guyana are based on the solid foundations of our shared history and culture. Both our countries can look forward to further co-operation in various sectors of shared interest to the benefit of our two peoples. Our close cooperation in international fora is an important dimension of our strengthening ties. The recent visit of Prime Minister Moses Nagamootoo to India has deepened our mutual understanding.
    
    I am glad to learn that Guyana holds the current Presidency of CARICOM. I am confident under your presidency, India’s engagement with the Caribbean Community will be further enhanced.
    
    I take this opportunity to convey to Your Excellency my best wishes for your personal well-being and for the continued progress and prosperity of the friendly people of Guyana”.
