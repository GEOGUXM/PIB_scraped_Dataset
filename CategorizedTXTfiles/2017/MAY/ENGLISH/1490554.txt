      Shri Amitabh Kant, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India), has advocated conducting a survey on the status of Policing in various States. Inaugurating the 1st National Conference of Micro Missions of National Police Mission (NPM) here today, Shri Kant said the Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) should come out with the survey of State Police, including at district-level, based on various parameters including outcomes, to bring about change in policing. Stating that economic development and internal security have a symbiotic relationship, he said the police will also have to act as an instrument of social change.

      
      Laying out a survey of districts based on four development indices, - Health, Eductaion, Poverty & Roads, Shri Kant pointed out it is apparent that the districts lowest in the combined index are concentrated in the Northern and Eastern parts of the country. These very 100 districts lowest on the development index pose the gravest challenges to security and law and order, he added.
      
      Shri Kant said as India aims to accelerate the growth rate from the present 7.6% annually to 9-10% for the next three decades or more, it will be marked by a demographic profile consisting of a majority 72% youth population and witness a huge amount of urbanization. For the economy to pick pace India will also have to take the share of women’s contribution to GDP from the present 17% to 40% share in the developed world economies, he added.
      
      Shri Kant also deliberated on ‘Out of Box Ideas’ to reform the current policing framework in the country. He gave various examples to state the heightened competitiveness being demonstrated by various State Governments in terms of ‘Ease of doing business’. He further laid stress on adoption of similar competitive spree amongst different Departments of the Government including the Police.
      
      He also emphasized on areas which could revolutionize the current police functioning across India. These included:
      
      • Improve Citizen-police interface
      
      • Improve the condition of Police Stations
      
      • Improve judicial system
      
      • Improve rate of conviction
      
      • Provide healing touch to victims
      
      • Ensure extensive & pragmatic use of technology
      
      Shri Kant gave references of international police departments to exemplify emphatic use of technology in crime investigation and prevention. Prudent use of Social Media & Data Analytics can help in gathering information, tracing suspects and identifying crime trends, he added. Shri Kant also unveiled the National Police Mission’s Compendium on Projects, which shares insights on various Micro Mission Projects being carried out under the aegis of NPM.
      
      Speaking on the occasion, Dr. M. C. Borwankar, DG, BPR&D, said the eight Micro Missions under the NPM have been redesigned to include at least 25% young Officers of the level of Superintendents of Police. Shri Parvez Hayat, ADG, BPR&D also graced the occasion. Dr. Nirmal Kumar Azad, IG, Director, NPM is the Conference Secretary.
      
      The two-day Conference is being organised by the Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D), under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). The Conference aims to review, share learnings and trace the journey of NPM ever since its inception in 2008. It witnesses participation of representations of all eight Micro Missions. Nobel Laureate Shri Kailash Satyarthi will grace the Valedictory function tomorrow.
