    The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee addressed the 159th Founder’s Day Celebrations of Lawrence School at Ootacamund, The Nigiris today (May 23, 2017).


    Speaking on the occasion, the President said that education does not merely imply imparting information. Rather, values imparted by schools have to be absorbed in the personalities of students so that they become worthy citizens of our great nation. We do not want merely informed robots without any soul. We want human beings who are sensitive to the needs of society. He stated that the beaming and confident faces of students in the school, inspired confidence in him that the future of our country is safe in the hands of our young children who have the competence to face all odds and challenges.


    The President said that Lawrence school is a premier residential public school of our country. Established in 1858, it was set to impart vocational education to the orphans and children of European soldiers in India. Over the years, the school has developed its own unique character. He wished the management, staff and students of the school all success in their future endeavours.
