    The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, in his message on the eve of Buddha Purnima has said: -


    “On the joyous occasion of Buddha Purnima, I extend warm greetings and good wishes to all the citizens of the country.


    Lord Buddha is a resplendent symbol of lofty idealism and concern for humanity. The messages preached by Tathagatha, of compassion, non-violence and equality serve as beacon-lights for humanity in its path towards spiritual emancipation. Lord Buddha’s profound teachings of equality, love, kindness and tolerance are of increasing relevance in the present times.


    May the message of Lord Buddha inspire us to follow the path of truth and compassion and work unitedly for the peace, progress and prosperity of our nation”.
