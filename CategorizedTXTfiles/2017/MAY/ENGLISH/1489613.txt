    The Ministry of Women and Child Development has developed a Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for rehabilitation of children in conflict with law under the Juvenile Justice System. The said SOP aims to emphasize the cause of rehabilitation and social re-integration by providing for types of institutional care, after care services, foster care and sponsorship to such children. The SOP is based on the principles of presumptive innocence and best interest of the child.


    The objective of the SOP is to reduce incarceration while protecting children from violence, abuse and exploitation. The SOP promotes rehabilitation that involves families and communities as a safer, more appropriate and effective approach than punitive measures. The SOP has been designed to be a useful guide for stake holders while dealing with children in conflict with law such as functionaries of child care institutions, Juvenile Justice Boards/ Childrenâ€™s Courts, National and State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, State/UT Governments and Police etc.


    The Ministry adopted a consultative process in developing the SOP by engaging with experts and advocates on issues of child rights and National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR). It was also placed on the website of the Ministry of WCD for seeking comments from various stakeholders.


    The SOP will help to provide possibilities and opportunities to children in conflict with law to reintegrate in the society.
