    The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee has extended his greetings and felicitations to the Government and people of Marshall Islands on the occasion of their Constitution Day (May 01, 2016).

      In a message to Her Excellency Dr. (Ms) Hilda C. Heine, the President of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the President has said, “On behalf of the Government and people of India and on my own behalf, I extend warm greetings to Your Excellency, the Government and people of the Republic of Marshall Islands on the occasion of your Constitution Day.
      Bilateral relations between our two countries are growing stronger. India’s dialogue with Pacific Island Countries (PIC) under the Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC) through the FIPIC-I Summit held in Suva in November 2014 and FIPIC-II Summit held in Jaipur in August 2015 has given us opportunities to work together to address issues and challenges currently being faced by Pacific Island Countries. India’s initiative in creating a Centre for Excellence in Information Technology and solar electrification of two hundred houses through the efforts of “Solar Mamas” trained in India has been fruitful and has contributed to the diversification of our relationship to include bilateral cooperation in the IT, tele-medicine, tele-education and renewable energy sectors.
      I am confident that the relations between India and the Republic of Marshall Islands will continue to strengthen in the years to come to the mutual benefit of both our peoples.
      Please accept, Excellency, my best wishes for your good health and well-being, as well as for the progress and prosperity of the friendly people of the Republic of Marshall Islands”.
