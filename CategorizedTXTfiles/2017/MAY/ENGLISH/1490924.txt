    The wreckage of IAF Su-30 MKI jet that went missing with two pilots onboard has been found in the thick forest around 60 Kms from Tezpur, Assam where it lost radar contact with the base. The wreckage was located today and ground parties are standing by to be airlifted to the crash site as the area is totally inaccessible. Search for flight data recorder and missing crew will be perused by the ground parties after they reach the crash site. Search parties of Army are also attempting to reach the crash site by trekking cross country, however their progress is hampered due to inclement weather, thick vegetation and steep gradient of the terrain.

    
    The Su-30 aircraft took off around 1030 h on 23 May 17 and had gone off the radar and lost radio contact around 1110 h when aircraft was around 60 Kms from Tezpur. The aircraft was on a routine training mission as part of a two aircraft formation.
    
    The aircraft was declared overdue and Search and Rescue operations were launched to locate the aircraft and the pilots. Help from civil administration and military authorities was also sought to locate the aircraft. Aerial search was commenced based on the last known position of the Su-30 MKI. Incessant rain and dense clouds hampered the search operations in air and on the ground. Search parties of IAF and Army set out to the area where the aircraft was declared missing. A court of Inquiry has been ordered to investigate the cause of the accident.
