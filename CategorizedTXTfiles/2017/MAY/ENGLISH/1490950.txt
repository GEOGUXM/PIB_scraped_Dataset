        The Government has given one final opportunity to all associations/organizations which have applied for renewal of their registration under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 (FCRA) but not uploaded their Annual Returns from Financial Year 2010-11 to 2014-15. All such NGOs can upload their missing Annual Returns along with the requisite documents within a period of 30 days, starting from May 15, 2017 to June 14, 2017. Further no compounding fee will be imposed on them for late filing of Annual Returns during this period.


        This exemption is one time measure and available to those associations who upload their missing Annual Returns from FY 2010-11 to FY 2014-15 within this period. The renewal of registration under FCRA cannot be granted unless the Annual Returns are uploaded by the organization.
