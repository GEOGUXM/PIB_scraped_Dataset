    The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee has written to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, conveying condolences on the loss of lives in the terror attack in Manchester.


    In his message, the President said, “We are deeply shocked by terror attack in Manchester. India condemns this heinous attack in strongest terms. We stand in solidarity with the people and the Government of the United Kingdom in this difficult hour.


    This is not an attack just against the UK and its people; it is an attack against the humanity and the values that we all live for. These repeated terror attacks are a grim reminder, yet again, of the need for us to intensify the global fight against terrorism. India is fully committed to working with the UK and the international community in defeating these evil forces.
