        Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Radha Mohan Singh said the initiatives taken under the leadership of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi for the welfare of farmers and the agriculture sector have started showing positive and encouraging results. The commitment of the Modi government towards the welfare of the farmers is resulting in qualitative improvement in the lives of farmers. Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that the Ministry of Agriculture is working to double farmers’ income by 2022, a goal set by the Prime Minister. Shri Singh was speaking at a press conference in National Media Centre on the completion of three years of the Modi government.


        Shri Radha Mohan Singh said in the last three years, the Modi government has created new and transparent working style for the growth of the nation. Under the guidance of the Prime Minister, the implementation of the farmers’ welfare scheme was turned into a mission by the government. From the perspective of good governance, innovative and reformist approach, our government laid the foundation of future-oriented India.


        Shri Singh said the Modi Government has succeeded in creating awareness among the farmers about initiatives taken for the development of the agriculture sector. In three years, continuous and robust efforts have been made to bring qualitative changes in lives of farmers and rural areas.


        Union Agriculture Minister said during UPA government, the expenditure made by the Ministry used to be less than the budgetary allocation. For instance, during the year 2011-12 budgetary allocation was Rs.24, 526 crores and the amount spent was just Rs.23, 290 crores. Similarly, in the year 2012-13 budgetary allocation was Rs.28, 284 crores and the amount spent was Rs.24, 630 crores. In the year 2013-14, the budgetary allocation was Rs.30, 224 crore and the amount spent was Rs.25, 896.


        On the other hand, under Modi government, the Ministry is spending more than the budgetary allocation for the welfare of the farmers. For instance, in the year 2016-17, the budgetary allocation was Rs. 45,035 crores, but it was increased to Rs. 57,503 crores in the revised budget.


        Keeping the welfare of the agriculture sector and farmers in mind, Modi government is increasing the budget every year For example, the total budget for the welfare of the agriculture sector during the UPA government’s four years - 2010-11 to 2013-14 - was Rs.1,04,337 crores, while the present government has allocated Rs.1,64,415 crore during the period of 2014-15 to 2017-18, which is 57.58 percent more.


        Shri Singh said that in the initial two years of the last three years, the government provided security and confidence to farmers during two consecutive years of monsoon shortfall. Apart from focusing on the distribution of Soil Health Card, extension of irrigation facilities, low-cost organic farming, national agricultural market, horticulture development, Agroforestry, bee keeping, dairy, fish and egg production, it also focused on agricultural education, research and extension. More investment has been made to strengthen cooperatives. In the last three year, several initiatives were taken to make the country self-reliant in pulses and oilseeds. The farmers were provided unprecedented security through Prime Minister's Fasal Bima Yojana, which has the lowest premium and covers various risks. The government has given priority to the interests of farmers by providing the District-wise contingency action plans and increasing the relief funds for the farmers affected by drought and hailstorm.
