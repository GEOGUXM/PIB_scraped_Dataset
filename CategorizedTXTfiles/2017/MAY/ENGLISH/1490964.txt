He said agriculture needs to be developed in line with the requirements of the 21st century. He added that farmers must benefit from the changing technology.


        He stressed on the need of modern agriculture and technological interventions, keeping in mind the specific needs of the region.The Prime Minister spoke of his vision of doubling farmers' incomes by 2022, the 75th anniversary of independence.


        Speaking on the occasion, the Agriculture Minister said the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji has pledged to double the farmers’ income by 2022 and we are committed to fulfil his resolve. In continuation, visualising the potential of north eastern states in improving the production of agriculture and allied sectors and farmers knowledge enhancement, impart appropriate agriculture information, the top level of agricultural research and education in the country, a new branch of Indian agricultural Institute is being established in Assam. In these states of north-east we see special glimpses of diversity and due to the agroclimatic condition cultivation of not only different types of crops but diverse types of spices are being successfully carried out. Now we need to accelerate this further and in achieving this goal, establishment of the agricultural institute will be a decisive step. I would like to say that establishment of this institute will be an important initiative in enhancing agricultural production and productivity together with the high standard of education and research and in times to come it will definitely improve the living standard of farmers of north eastern states of the country.


        Shri Singh said that to bring in another round of green revolution in the north-eastern parts of the country, the Prime Minister is laying the foundation stone of Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Assam, literally a replica of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi.


        The key achievements of IARI and Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare are as follows:


        · The journey of IARI started in PUSA, Darbhangha (Samastipur) district of North Bihar in 1905. At that time it was called the Agricultural Research Institute.


        · Afterwards it was renamed as Imperial Institute of Agricultural Research in 1911 and as Imperial Agricultural Research Institute in 1919.


        · The institute was transferred to Delhi on 29 July 1936.


        · After Independence it was re-christened as Indian Agricultural Research Institute and it was given the status of Deemed University in 1958.


        · This institute is the harbinger of the Green revolution. The new technologies and high yielding varieties developed at this institute and their demonstrations at farmers’ farm led to the Green Revolution.


        · There is a web of higher education institutes like IIts, IIMs etc., in the country. On the similar pattern our government has planned to establish agricultural research institutes like IARI, New Delhi, to promote higher agricultural education.


        · In this series one IARI was established in Jharkhand and now another is being established in Assam.


        · How serious is our Government about agriculture is obvious from the fact that the agricultural budget allocation in last four years (2014-15 to 2017-18) was of Rs 164,415 crore, which was during UPA government (2010-11 to 2013-14) only Rs 104,337 crore, an increase of approximately 57.58% in under our Prime minister.


        · The country is reaping the benefits of this now, and I feel happy to announce that in the year 2016-17 there has been a new record in the food grain production, and this is highest ever since independence.


        · Milk production during the three years - 2014-17 - was 465.5 MM tonnes, which is 16.9% more than that of 398 MM tonnes in 2011-2014.


        · Similarly fish production during the three years - 2014-17 - was 327.74 lakh tonnes, which is 20.1% more than that of 272.88 lakh tonnes in 2011-2014.


        · The egg production during the three years - 2014-17 - was 248.72 billion, which is 17.92% more than that of 210.93 billion in 2011-2014.


        · Similarly honey production during the three years - 2014-17 - was 263,930 M tonnes, which is 20.54% more than that of 218,950 M tonnes in 2011-2014.


        Shri Singh mentioned several farmer friendly schemes and programmes initiated by the present government, which include soil health card for improvement in the soil nutrition health, and traditional agriculture development scheme for improvement of organic farming. Apart from that farmers are benefiting from the organic value chain development mission with an investment of Rs. 400 crore for north-east,


        · development of national agriculture market or e-NAM by connecting 585 anaj mandis of the country through e-platform,


        · Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme) to safeguard the farmers from the destruction caused by natural calamities, Prime Minister Crop Irrigation Scheme etc.
