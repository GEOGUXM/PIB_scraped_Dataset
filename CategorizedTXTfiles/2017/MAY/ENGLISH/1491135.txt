    Kargil Martyrs’ Day is observed all across the country to honour the martyrs who had laid down their lives in defence of our country. In keeping with the glorious traditions of the IAF, four air warriors of Air Force Sarsawa too had attained Martyrdom on 28 May 99 during Kargil Operations. On that day, one MI-17 Helicopter of the base took off for a mission with Squadron Leader Rajiv Pundir as pilot, Flight Lieutenant S Muhilan as co-pilot, Sergeant PVNR Prasad as Flight gunner and Sergeant RK Sahu as Flight Engineer. While carrying out a rocket attack on Tiger Hill in the Kargil Sector, the helicopter was shot down by the enemy and these air warriors made the supreme sacrifice in keeping with the highest traditions of service. Since then, 28th May is observed as Martyrs’ Day every year at this Station to honour these brave air warriors. This year, on 28 May the Air Officer Commanding and all air warriors of Air Force Station Sarsawa paid tribute to these brave air warriors by placing floral tributes at the War Memorial to commemorate the 18th anniversary of their supreme sacrifice. At the same time, four helicopters of the base took off for ‘Missing Man Formation’ in the sky, thereby, remembering the martyrs and showing gratitude towards them. Further, in the evening, a candle lighting ceremony was also organized where all families of the Station gathered and paid homage to the war heroes by lighting candles at the Station War Memorial.
