    A reputed US based international media house in the latest issue of its publication ‘Condé Nast Traveller’ has listed the river cruise on Ganga as one of the ‘six river cruises to take in 2017’. The media house has placed the luxury cruise vessel Ganges Voyager II which sails on the Ganga from Kolkata to Varanasi, in the league of cruises on Mekong and Yangtze in China, Amazon in South America, Volga in Russia and Irrawaddy in Myanmar. Conde Nast’s endorsement of Ganga as a cruise destination is a shot in the arm for river tourism in the country.
    
    The Inland Waterways Authority of India facilitates cruise operations on NW-1 (river Ganga) from Kolkata to Varanasi in collaboration with private cruise operators. The facilities provided by IWAI include navigation aids including night navigation facility, embarking and disembarking at designated locations, facilitating expeditious crossing of Farakka Navigation Lock, pilotage, and assistance in distress
    
    National Waterway NW-1 from Varanasi to Haldia is being developed by the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI), under the Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP). In addition to becoming one of the principal cargo movement routes in India, this stretch on NW-1has good potential for river cruise tourism.
