    In his welcome address Dr. Madhukar Gupta Additional Secretary in the Department of Public Enterprises highlighted the importance of this event and appreciated the overwhelming response of the participants.


    Union Minister Shri Anant Geete exhorted upon the CPSEs to focus on core areas of social sector especially the Swachtha Abhiyaan, Education and Drinking Water on priority basis. He said, though the amendments carried out in the Companies Act, 2013 making it mandatory for the establishments to incur 2 percent spending on CSR activities from their profit, be it in private sector or the CPSEs, still a voluntary approach and mind set in this regard is capable of bringing sea changes. He said the Swachtha Abhiyaan is running successfully just because of the active participation of CPSEs. The Minister said it is just because of the lack of sanitation facilities in our rural areas school that is aggravating the school dropout cases of girls. Shri Geete said lack of basic infrastructure facilities in rural areas is hindering the quest of students for Secondary and Higher Education. He also referred to the drinking water scarcity in our country. Shri Geete said there is no dearth of either funds or resources in our country and hence the CSR activities should be oriented in this direction amicably.


    Shri Geete referred to the Prime Minister initiative’s of Skill India, Digital India and Make in India and made a fervent appeal to the CPSEs heads to follow the guidelines chalked out by the DPE in this regard. He however expressed concern on the said reports of CSR funds getting diverted by frivolous means to NGOs. He advised the CPSEs to remain vigilant and cautious in this regard. He said success of CPSEs ultimately makes the Ministry and the Minister successful on every count. He said “I am proud of the exemplary work rendered by our CPSEs for CSR activities so far.” Shri Geete expressed the hope that this will continue for him too. He further hoped that the deliberations in this three day meet will certainly frame a new charter of success.


    On this occasion Minister of State in the Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo lauded the role of CPSEs in fostering the CSR measures satisfactorily.

In the realm of Business Sustainability, SEBI has mandated Business Responsibility Reporting for top 500 listed companies based on their market capitalization from 1 April 2016. This move is an effort to improve corporate governance practices and transparency in terms of reporting of socially responsible activities carried out by the business houses.
