      The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee has extended his greetings and felicitations to the King and people of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on the eve of their Independence Day (May 25, 2017).
      
      In a message to His Majesty King Abdullah II, the King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the President has said, “On behalf of the Government and the people of India and on my own behalf, it gives me great pleasure to extend warm greetings and felicitations to Your Majesty and to the people of Jordan on the occasion of your Independence Day.
      
      India and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan share warm and friendly relations. Over the years, our bilateral ties have been further strengthened. The recent visit of Chief of the Royal Court of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan was an important step in this direction. Both our countries are committed to expand bilateral trade and enhance our economic cooperation. The US$ 860 million joint venture project in the fertilizer sector is a landmark initiative. We hope to see many more such fruitful partnerships in the coming years.
      
      Please accept, Your Majesty, my best wishes for your good health and success and for the progress and prosperity of the friendly people of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan”.
