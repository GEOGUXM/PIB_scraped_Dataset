    A training programme being conducted by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) began here today to improve the preparedness of Parliament House Complex (PHC) security staff to respond to CBRN emergencies, encompassing threats emanating from the use of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and/or Nuclear (CBRN) material.
    
    The five-day training programme will train security personnel of PHC on various aspects of CBRN emergencies.
    
    Speaking on the occasion Shri R.K. Jain, Member, NDMA said, "In today's world, CBRN emergencies have become a reality. Comprehensive planning, preparedness and an effective response strategy will equip us to deal with such exigencies effectively."
    
    Underlining the need for CBRN training, Dr. D.N. Sharma, Member, NDMA, said that even small CBRN accidents can trigger immense psychological distress among people. "It is, therefore, important that our security personnel are able to deal with such eventualities holistically," said Dr. Sharma.
    
    The programme consists of lectures, live demonstrations of detection and decontamination as well as use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The participants will also be trained on Basic life support, triage and casualty carrying techniques as well as the working of a HazMat (Hazardous Material) vehicle.
    
    Participants will also be given a hands-on training by way of a mock drill in a simulated CBRN scenario by a trained National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team at its 8th Battalion base in Ghaziabad.
    
    This is the 17th in a series of training programmes conducted by NDMA for security personnel over the years. So far, more than 800 security staff have been trained to handle CBRN emergencies.
