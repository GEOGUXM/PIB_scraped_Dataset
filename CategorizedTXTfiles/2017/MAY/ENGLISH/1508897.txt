        * Its footprint that extends all over South Asia.
        * The South Asia Satellite has 12 Ku band transponders which India's neighbours can utilise to increase communications.
        * Each country will get access to at least one transponder through which they could beam their own programming.
        * The satellite will facilitate DTH television, VSAT links, tele-education, telemedicine and disaster management support. It will provide critical communication links in times of disasters such as earthquakes, cyclones, floods, and tsunamis.
