    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall have been given in following sub-sections:


    1.1 Crude oil production by ONGC during April, 2017 was 1847.16 TMT which is 0.08% higher than the monthly target and 2.51% higher when compared with April, 2016.


    1.2 Crude oil production by OIL during April, 2017 was 273.24 TMT which is 2.42% lower than monthly target but 4.53% higher than production in April, 2016. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


    v Less than planned contribution from high producing areas like Greater Hapjan, Shalmari, Chandmari and Moran fields primarily on account of rise in water cut.


    v Less than planned contribution from new drilling wells and work over wells.


    1.3 Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April, 2017 was 818.45 TMT which is 6.31% lower than the monthly target and 8.44% lower than April, 2016. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


    v RJ-ON-90/1: Bhagyam production less due to 33 KV OHL rectification works. Mangala 70 wells shutdown for work over. Few high water cut wells closed at Mangala, poor reservoir performance of Bhagyam.


    v Panna-Mukta: Planned shutdown from 19-27.04.2017


    v Natural Decline in Ravva & CB-OS/2


    Natural Gas


    2 Natural gas production during April, 2017 was 2532.73 MMSCM which is 9.19% lower than the target for the month but 1.80% higher when compared with April, 2016. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II. Unit-wise crude oil production for the month of April, 2017 vis-à-vis April, 2016 has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

    Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production


    2.1 Natural gas production by ONGC during April, 2017 was 1790.07 MMSCM which is 5.74% lower than the monthly target but 9.76% higher when compared with April, 2016. Shortfall in production was mainly due to shutdown of BPA Process Platform.


    2.2 Natural gas production by OIL during April, 2017 was 241.28 MMSCM which is 0.93% lower than the monthly target and 3.62% lower than April, 2016.


    2.3 Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April, 2017 was 501.39 MMSCM which is 22.45% lower than the monthly target and 17.37% lower when compared with April, 2016. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


    v Underperformance of wells in KG- OSN-2001/3


    v Underperformance of Sohagpur West CBM block, few wells closed for planned maintenance in Raniganj East CBM block.


    v RJ-ON-90/1: Bhagyam production less due to 33 KV OHL rectification works. Mangala 70 wells shutdown for work over. Few high water cut wells closed at Mangala, poor reservoir performance of Bhagyam.


    v AAP-ON-94/1 (HOEC): Production deferred due to delay in grant of PML.


    v Closure of 2 wells in D1D3 field in KG-DWN-98/3.


    v Panna-Mukta: Planned shutdown.


    Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)


    3 Refinery production during April, 2017 was 20013.86 TMT which is 0.22% higher than the target for the month but 0.70% lower when compared with April, 2016. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III. Company-wise production for the month of April, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

    Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production


    3.1 CPSE Refineries’ production during April, 2017 was 11153.76 TMT which is 0.47% lower than the target for the month but 0.15% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


    v IOCL, Paradip: Throughput restricted due to maintenance works in SRU


    v IOCL, Haldia: Throughput is restricted due to high VGO stock and low crude availability due to pilferage in crude oil pipe-line.


    v BPCL, Mumbai: Planned outage of CDU3 & HCU for turnaround & revamp.


    v HPCL, Visakh: Unplanned shutdown of CDU – II.


    v CPCL, Manali: Lower than target due to shutdown of OHCU/HGU on account of Instrument Air failure and also exchanger leak in HGU.


    v CPCL, CBR: Product upliftment constraints on account of BS-4 norms.


    3.2 Production in JV refineries during April, 2017 was 1372.44 TMT which is 10.77% higher than the target for the month but 5.59% lower than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year.


    3.3 Production in private refineries during April, 2017 was 7487.66 TMT which is 0.50% lower than the target for the month and 1.03% lower when compared with April, 2016.


    3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of April, 2017 vis-à-vis April, 2016 are given at Annexures-IV and V respectively.
