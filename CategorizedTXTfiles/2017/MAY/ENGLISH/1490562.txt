    At present, this App is available for Android Mobile phones which can be downloaded from Google Play Store. In this App the concept of Physical web is implemented. When you are in the monument or Museum it will deliver you the message about Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and ask you to report the garbage around you. All you need is to enable the Bluetooth of your mobile device. Even if you did not have the App installed then also you will be delivered the message by Google about the Swachh Bharat Abiyan and which will give you the link to install the App. Once you start the App it will ask to take photograph of the garbage and write the comment and just submit. It will be reported to the authority on the backend.
    
    The App will be monitored by the Ministry of Culture and will play an important role in cultivating the significance of cleanliness to the citizens.
