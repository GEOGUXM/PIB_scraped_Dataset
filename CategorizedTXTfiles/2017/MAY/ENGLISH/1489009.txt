    The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee has extended his greetings and felicitations to the Government and people of the State of Israel on the occasion of their National Day (May 02, 2017).
    
    In a message to His Excellency Mr. Reuven Rivlin, the President of the State of Israel, the President has said, “On behalf of the Government and people of India and on my own behalf, I extend warm greetings and felicitations to you, the Government and the people of Israel on the occasion of your National Day.
    
    As India and Israel celebrate 25 years of our diplomatic relations, we look forward to closer cooperation between our Governments and peoples in all areas of our shared interest. Your historic visit to India in November last year opened new avenues for our joint efforts in diverse fields including defence, water resources development, agriculture, dairy farming innovation and scientific research and development.
    
    I am confident that our long-standing friendship will be further strengthened and our mutual understanding enhanced in the years to come.
    
    Please accept, Excellency, my best wishes for your personal well-being and success as also for the progress and prosperity of the people of Israel”.
