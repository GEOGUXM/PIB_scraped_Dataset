      Posted On: 13 MAY 2017 5:44PM by PIB Hyderabad


    There have been certain misleading reports in some sections of the Press on the matter related to closure of Gough Road by Army. The Army would like to clarify that no roads of AOC Centre, other than Gough Road, are intended to be closed with effect from 01 June 2017.


    It is for the information of all concerned that as per the order of the Honâ€™ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the AOC roads, of which Gough Road is a part, are internal military roads and its control rests with the Local Military Authority. The administration, training and security of AOC Centre are being adversely affected due to this road being used as a thoroughfare since long. Accordingly, Army has carried out the implementation of traffic restrictions on some roads in a phased manner so that there is least inconvenience to the general public.


    Further, to help the public, emergency vehicles such as Ambulances, Fire Brigades and School Buses will be permitted to pass through Gough Road at all times. Restrictions for use of the roads at night will continue as hitherto-fore except for emergency vehicles. It is also clarified that construction of alternative road is being actively pursued by the Army authorities with GHMC. It may thus be seen that on its part the Army is doing its best to ensure that local populace is not put to inconvenience.


    The willingness on the part of Defence authorities to objectively examine and render assistance as required in developing alternative roads along the periphery of AOC Centre towards Mahendra Hill has also been communicated to concerned authorities.
