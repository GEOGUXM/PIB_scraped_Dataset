    Sri Bandaru Dattatreya, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Labour & Employment, Govt of India distributed financial sanction letters to six Khadi Institutions in Hyderabad. The letters were of the value of Rs. 3.44 crores. While speaking on the occasion, the Minister asserted that the Centre is determined to strengthen the Khadi consumption in a big way all over the country. During the freedom struggle, the countrymen encouraged the desi goods particularly the Khadi products, Sri Dattatreya recalled. The rural artisans should be given sufficient support. Especially the marketing amenities must be enhanced, the Minister added. Khadi products achieved Rs.50,000 crores sales in 2016-17, which is a record. It has been possible with Prime Minister Sri Narendra Modi's initiation. The PM appealed to the people to go for Khadi, Sri Dattatreya reminded. The makers of Khadi apparel must take to the latest technology and they should strive to increase the productivity, he said. The Government earmarked Rs.2 lakh crores for small traders in the last Budget. We are contemplating to enhance the loan book from Rs.50 lakh to Rs.5 crores under the MUDRA Bank, the Union Minister revealed. The weaker sections, very particularly the SC and ST people must be given priority in the sanction of these loans. We would take steps to largely use Khadi bedsheets, aprons etc. in the ESIC hospitals, he said. On this occasion, the KVIC arranged an exhibition. The Minister inaugurated it and he visited the stalls.


    The Prime Minister's appeal has gone down well among people. The demand for Khadi got a boost in the Southern States, Sri C. Chandramouli, Chairman, KVIC, South Zone said. Dr. M.A. Quddus, Director, KVIC, Telangana said that Rs.50 crore worth orders procured from the Ministry of Health. He detailed the steps being taken to raise the sales of Khadi product range in the State. Sri M. Bhumaiah, Director, KVIC, Andhra Pradesh State has also participated in the event.
