      * Its footprint that extends all over South Asia.
      * The South Asia Satellite has 12 Ku band transponders which India's neighbours can utilise to increase communications.
      * Each country will get access to at least one transponder through which they could beam their own programming.
      * The satellite will facilitate DTH television, VSAT links, tele-education, telemedicine and disaster management support. It will provide critical communication links in times of disasters such as earthquakes, cyclones, floods, and tsunamis.
