      Kutch has a very special place in my heart. It is blessed with wonderful people and a remarkable spirit of resilience.
      From suffering unimaginable destruction due to the 2001 quake, Kutch is today known as one of India’s fastest growing districts.
      On Tuesday, I will be in Gandhinagar to participate in the opening ceremony of the meetings of the @AfDB_Group .
      The Annual Meetings of @AfDB_Group have chosen the very relevant theme of ‘Transforming Agriculture for Wealth Creation in Africa.’
      On the sidelines of @AfDB_Group Annual Meetings, I shall meet some of the distinguished delegates who will be taking part in #AfDBAM2017 .”, the Prime Minister tweeted.
