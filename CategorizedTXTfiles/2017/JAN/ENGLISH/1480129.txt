The GVA estimates of this sector have been compiled using the First Advance Estimates of production of major Kharif crops for 2016-17 and targets based on rabi sowings. According to the information furnished by the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation (DAC), the production growth of food grains during the Kharif season of agriculture year 2016-17 was 8.9 percent as compared to decline of 3.2 percent during the same period in 2015-16. In case of livestock sector, estimates of production, mainly in the form of targets are available for milk, egg, and wool, from the Department of Animal Husbandry, Ministry of Agriculture. Around 39.0 percent of GVA of this sector is based on livestock products, forestry and fisheries, which registered a combined growth of above 3.7 percent in 2016-17.

IIP of mining registered growth rate of (-)0.2 percent during April-October, 2016-17 as compared to 2.2 percent during April-October, 2015-16. Advance Estimate of IIP for 2016-17 of this sector, compiled by dividing the cumulative index for the first 7 months of the current financial year, by the average of ratio of 7 months index to the annual index of past years has been used.
