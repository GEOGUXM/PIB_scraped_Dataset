    The Agreement between India and Maldives for avoidance of double taxation of income derived from International Air Transport was signed at Government level during the visit of Hon’ble President of Maldives to New Delhi on 11th April, 2016. The Agreement provides for relief from double taxation for airline enterprises of India and Maldives by way of exemption of income derived by the enterprise of India from the operation of aircraft in international traffic, from Maldivian tax and vice-versa.
    
    · ADVANCE PRICING AGREEMENT (APA)
    In order to create a tax-friendly atmosphere by way of reducing such litigations arising out of transfer pricing and giving tax certainty on the profits arising out of international transactions, the Government of India introduced the APA programme in the year 2012. It gives tax certainty for the Indian taxpayers regarding their international transactions for a period of five future years without regular Transfer Pricing Audits. Further, the Rollback provisions in the APA program were introduced in the year 2014 to enable the taxpayer to roll back the provisions of the APA for four previous years from the first year of the APA period. This gives certainty of determination of Arm’s Length Price (ALP) of the covered transactions for four past years and leads to withdrawal of appeals on transfer pricing litigations on such transactions, if any pending, by both sides.
    The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has entered into 115 APAs with the taxpayers so far, which includes 7 bilateral APAs and 108 unilateral APAs. Out of 115 APAs, a total of 47 unilateral APAs and 4 bilateral APA have already been concluded in the first six months of the current Financial Year. The CBDT expects more APAs to be concluded and signed in the near future.
    · MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE (MAP)
    MAP is an alternative mechanism available to taxpayers through Double Tax Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) for resolving disputes giving rise to double taxation. Multi National Enterprises (MNEs) seek to resolve transfer pricing disputes through this mechanism. In the last two years, CBDT has invigorated the MAP proceedings with many countries.
    A historical framework agreement was reached in January 2015 with USA, which has invoked the highest number of MAP requests relating to Transfer Pricing disputes. This resulted in more than 100 cases getting resolved in FY 2015-16, involving transfer pricing disputes amounting to approximately Rs.5000 crore, which was unprecedented. In FY 2016-17 also, the momentum of resolution of MAP cases continues and 66 MAP cases relating to Transfer Pricing issues and 42 cases relating to Treaty Interpretation were agreed to be resolved during the meeting held in October, 2016.
    · SHIPPING BUSINESS
    A Circular bearing No 30 of 2016 has been issued by CBDT on 26/08/2016. The Circular lays down guidelines that are to be followed by the Assessing Officers at the time of issue of No Objection Certificate leading to the Port Clearance of Ships belonging to the foreign shipping companies and also assessment of voyage returns that are subsequently filed by foreign ships.
    The Circular has done away with the administrative requirement of obtaining a voyage NOC for Foreign Shipping Companies that are entitled for 100% relief from payment of taxes in India on account of a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) that India has with the other country. The Circular would improve ease of doing business in India for the Foreign Shipping Companies.

    · THE DIRECT TAX DISPUTE RESOLUTION SCHEME, 2016


    In order to contain huge backlog of cases pending in appeals and reduce unnecessary litigation, the ‘Direct Tax Dispute Resolution Scheme, 2016’ (the Scheme), has been introduced. Under the Scheme, an applicant, subject to conditions specified therein, may seek resolution of appeals, pending with the Commissioner (Appeals) as on 29th February, 2016 in respect of disputed income and disputed wealth, and with any appellate authority in respect of tax arrears (specified tax) resulting out of retrospective amendment.


    The Scheme came into effect on the 1st of June, 2016, and shall be open up to 31st day of December, 2016. The Direct Tax Dispute Resolution Rules have been notified vide Notification No.34 & 35, dated 26.05.2016. In order to resolve various issues raised by the stakeholders, a clarification in the form of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) has been issued vide Circular No. 33 dated 12th September, 2016. All efforts to publicize the Scheme and encourage taxpayers to avail of the opportunity are being made.


    III. E-GOVERNANCE INITIATIVES

    · e-payment of taxes
    E-payment of taxes has been enabled through Net Banking and ATMs and more than 88.49% of tax is collected through this mode facilitating payment to taxes anytime from home/office without having to go to a bank branch. Companies and auditable cases (taxpayers where provisions of section 44AB of the Income-tax Act, 1961 are applicable) are mandatorily required to electronically pay taxes. The percentage of tax collected using electronic payment option has increased to 74.91% in count terms and 88.49% in value terms during FY 2015-16.
    · Refund Banker Scheme
    With a view to eliminate the interface between the Department and the taxpayer on account of the manual issue and dispatch of refund cheques, the Department decided to streamline and automate the process of printing and sending of refund cheques the Department initiated a centralized system for printing and credit of refund cheques through the State Bank of India which was called the Refund Banker Scheme.
    This ensures that taxpayer gets his refunds directly into his bank account or dispatch of the cheque by speed post from 18 different locations of SBI across the country without any intervention and avoiding delays in decentralized posting of cheques etc. The refunds despatched under this scheme now account for 99% of the refunds (in count) received by the taxpayer without any direct interaction with the Department.
    · Non-filers Monitoring System (NMS)
    The Non-filers Monitoring System (NMS) has been rolled-out for pilot implementation to prioritize action on non-filers with potential tax liabilities. Data analysis was carried out to identify non-filers about whom specific information was available in the AIR, CIB and TDS/TCS Returns database. The number of non-filers with potential tax liabilities identified in various NMS cycles is as under:
    · NMS cycle 1 (2013): 12.19 lakh
    · NMS Cycle 2 (2014): 22.09 lakh
    · NMS Cycle 3 (2015): 44.07 lakh
    · NMS Cycle 4 (2015): 58.95 lakh
    Under this initiative, more than 94 lac returns have been filed and self-assessment tax of more than Rs. 16,500 crore has been paid by the target segment.
    · Project Insight
    The Income Tax Department signed contract for implementation of Project Insight in July 2016. Project Insight aims to develop a comprehensive platform for effective utilization of information to promote voluntary compliance and deter noncompliance; to impart confidence that all eligible persons pay appropriate tax; and to promote fair and judicious tax administration.
    The Project would play a key role in data mining to track tax evaders and widening of the tax-base. The new technical infrastructure will also be leveraged for implementation of Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act Inter Governmental Agreement (FATCA IGA) and Common Reporting Standard (CRS).
    The Project envisages the creation of two new centres, namely (i) a new Compliance Management Central Processing Centre (CMCPC) for handling PAN population, master data management, preliminary verification, generation of bulk letters/notices and follow-up for greater productivity and efficiency; and (ii) an Income Tax Transaction Analysis Centre (INTRAC) for data integration, data processing, data quality monitoring, data analytics, web and text mining, enterprise reporting, alert and compliance management and research support.
    The Project will be rolled out in a phased manner during the period 2016-18.
    · Tax Deduction at Source
    1. Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) is one of the means of collection of direct taxes. TDS constitutes nearly 40% of the direct tax collections. Since the information submitted by the deductor in the TDS Statement, forms the basis on which the deductee is given the credit of taxes, therefore, there was a need to have a robust mechanism that ensures correct, reliable flow of data to the database of Income Tax Department and its collation on the basis of taxpayers’ identifier (Permanent Account Number).
    2. Centralized Processing Cell for TDS, CPC(TDS), has been conceptualized to undertake end-to-end processing of TDS Statements through a Rule based Technology enabled system, leading to uniform results and faster turn-around-time, ensuring seamless flow of data for tax credits. CPC-TDS introduces transparency in the processes through online display of information and provides an integrated platform for tax deductors, taxpayers and the officers of the Department. Thus, it forms the backbone of overall TDS administration in the country.

    3. CPC(TDS) is a technology driven transformation initiative for TDS administration that provides a comprehensive solution through Tax Deduction, Reconciliation, Analysis and Correction Enabling System (TRACES) , its core engine.


    4. CPC(TDS) undertakes processing of TDS Statements to generate “Annul Tax Credit” statements for each taxpayer in form of 26AS, TDS Certificates in Form 16/16A and identifies TDS Defaults of Short Payment, Short Deduction, Interest etc.


    5. CPC(TDS) reconciles and correlates information from various sources including Banks (tax payment), Deductors (reporting tax deduction), Assessing Officers (mapping of no/low tax deductions) and Tax Professionals (reporting International transactions).

    6. With a robust tax reconciliation mechanism put in place through the CPC(TDS), the tax payer is given accurate and timely credit for the taxes paid/deducted. This has led to faster refunds and minimal grievances. The savings for the tax payers include: -
    o Cost of maintaining voluminous physical TDS certificates.
    o Cost involved in reconciliation of taxes with the deductors
    o Cost involved in submitting income tax returns in paper form with annexures.
    7. Facility of sending SMS alerts to salaried taxpayers of TDS deposited by his deductor/ employer launched in October, 2016.
    · E-filing of Income Tax Returns
    E-filing of Income Tax Returns was introduced for the 1 st time in 2006-07 for corporates. The No. of e-file returns has increased from around 4 lacs in F.Y. 2006-07 to 434 lacs in F.Y. 2015-16. Nearly 74% of the e-returns are voluntarily filed; this facility is free of cost to tax-payers. E-returns now constitute for nearly 85% of total returns filed with the Department. In F.Y. 2015-16 nearly 434 lacs e-returns have been filed in comparison to 341 lacs e-return filed during F.Y. 2014-15 representing a growth of around 27%. No of e-returns filed during F.Y. 2015-16 (upto 30.09.2015) stands at 245 lacs in comparison to 289 lacs e-returns filed for the corresponding period of F.Y. 2016-17( upto 30.09.2016) registering a growth of 17%.
    E-filing project had won the National Silver E-Governance Award for Citizen Centric Service in 2007-08.

    Other highlights of e-filing project are: -
    · Around 53% returns are filed after office hours, indicating the convenience of the tax-payers of not having to stand in queues outside tax offices on last few days.
    · The e-filing website also facilitates the filing of returns in response to issue of defective notice, filing of rectification request, filing of response to non-compliance letters, online grievance redressal etc. ensuring that this becomes a single electronic gateway for tax-payer interaction with the department.

    · Centralized Processing Centre (CPC-ITR) , Bengaluru

    IV. GOOD GOVERNANCE INITIATIVES
    Directorate of Income-tax (Tax Payer Services )
    CBDT vide Order No. F.No.A-11011/02/2015-Ad.VII dated 26.02.2016 has created the Directorate of Income-tax (Tax Payer Services)-I. The dedicated TPS vertical has been created for streamlining the delivery and monitoring of taxpayer services. The Directorate is responsible for overseeing all matters relating to grievances. The initiative of the department is intended to provide effective resolution of grievances and thereby providing ease of compliance and better taxpayer services.
    Monitoring and Administration of Taxpayer Services through ASK Centres
    As per the structure of the Tax Payer Services delivery and monitoring system, Aaykar Seva Kendra (ASK) has been made the smallest unit for Tax Payer Services. Aayakar Seva Kendra (ASK) is the mechanism used by CBDT for implementing the philosophy of ‘Sevottam’ initiated by the PMO. Aayakar Seva Kendra (ASK) is the single window system for implementation of Citizen’s Charter of the Income Tax Department and a mechanism for achieving excellence in public service delivery. The procedure to be followed at the ASKs is provided in the Process Document of the Service Quality Manual(SQM).
    There are approx. 300 ASKs functioning in the Income-tax Department. After an ASK achieves excellence in service delivery as per norms under the Sevottam Scheme, a certification under IS 15700:2005 is to be obtained from the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). In this regard, the BIS have certified 80 ASK Centres under the IS 15700: 2005. The work of certification of the other ASKs is under progress.
    The continuous monitoring and visits to the ASK Centres by this Directorate has contributed to increased awareness amongst the officers regarding disposal of DAK using the Sevottam Software and has resulted in improved performance in the area of grievance redressal.
    Revamped ASKs using e-Nivaran
    Unified Grievance Handling Mechanism (e-Nivaran) is aimed at consolidating grievances received across all platforms viz. CPGRAMs, E-filing, CPC-ITR, CPC-TDS, ASK, NSDL, UTIISL and SBI-Refund Banker. Internal channelization of grievances between different department systems and workflow based grievance resolution mechanism in the ITBA for department users is aimed at centralized monitoring and speeding the grievance redressal mechanism. Out of 1.07 lakh grievances received on e-Nivaran platform, 0.78 lakh grievances (73%) have already been resolved.
    B. ISSUES REGARDING BLACK MONEY
    The Government has taken several steps to effectively tackle the issue of black money, particularly black money stashed away abroad. They include policy-level initiatives, more effective enforcement action on the ground, putting in place robust legislative and administrative frameworks, focus on capacity building and better capture and use of information through ICT and data mining. Recent major initiatives in this regard include:
    (i) Constitution of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) on Black Money under Chairmanship and Vice-Chairmanship of two former Judges of Hon’ble Supreme Court
    (ii) Enactment of a comprehensive law to tackle black money stashed away abroad – ‘The Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015’ which has come into force w.e.f. 01.07.2015
    (iii) Constitution of Multi-Agency Group (MAG) consisting of officers of Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for investigation of recent revelations in Panama paper leaks
    (iv) Proactively engaging with foreign governments with a view to facilitate and enhance the exchange of information under Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs)/Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs)/Multilateral Conventions
    (v) Participation in global efforts to combat tax evasion/black money by joining the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement in respect of Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) and entering information sharing arrangement with USA under its Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
    (vi) Renegotiation of DTAAs with other countries to bring the Article on Exchange of Information to International Standards and expanding India’s treaty network by signing new DTAAs and TIEAs with many jurisdictions to facilitate the exchange of information and to bring transparency
    (vii) Amendment of the Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002 in 2015 enabling attachment and confiscation of property equivalent in value held within the country where the property/proceeds of crime has been taken or held outside the country
    (viii) Enactment of the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2015 to amend the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 with a view to enable confiscation of Benami property and provide for prosecution
    (ix) Initiation of ‘Project Insight’ by the Income Tax Department to enforce better tax compliance through effective use of available information. These measures and sustained and prompt action by the Income Tax Department have resulted in bringing to tax substantial amounts of undisclosed income, levy of concealment penalty and filing of criminal prosecution complaints for various offences in appropriate cases.

    4. Amendment of the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988:
    The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016 has been enacted w.e.f. August 2016 by the Government to deal with domestic black money.

This new regime will enable capture of high value cash transactions in select sectors, lead to widening of tax base through identification of new tax payers, non-filers and stop filers, curb tax evasion in a non-intrusive manner and encourage use of plastic money.
    7. Investigation in HSBC foreign bank accounts cases:
    Investigations based on information received from French Government on Indians holding bank accounts in HSBC bank in Switzerland has resulted into detection of considerable amount of undisclosed income.

    8. Investigation in cases revealed by International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ):
    In 2013, the ICIJ, a Washington based organization, put out in public information pertaining to offshore entities based in no tax or low tax jurisdictions, including many Indian entities. Investigations of these cases by the Income Tax Department have led to detection of substantial amounts of deposits in these undisclosed foreign accounts . Investigations have led to filing of 55 prosecution complaints in 24 such cases. Investigations are also on in cases revealed in ‘Panama Papers leaks’ by ICIJ in 2016. A high level Multi-Agency Group (MAG) has been constituted for the purpose. So far, the MAG has submitted 5 reports to the Government.
    9. The Income Declaration Scheme, 2016:

    The Income Declaration Scheme, 2016 (the Scheme) came into effect from 1st June, 2016. It provided an opportunity to persons who had not paid full taxes in the past to come forward and declare their domestic undisclosed income and assets. Declarations could be made online as well as in printed copies of the prescribed Form up to midnight on 30th September, 2016.


    In order to facilitate the taxpayers and to spread awareness about the Scheme, the CBDT issued a number of FAQs to address various queries received. Major issues clarified included manner of declaration of fictitious liability, allowance of cost indexation and holding period benefit for registered immovable property, sanctity of valuation report etc. Difficulties with respect to payment of taxes in a short span were removed by permitting payment of tax in 3 instalments, the last being in September 2017. Absolute confidentiality was promised under the scheme in respect of the declarations made to reassure the declarants. Innovative publicity methods like Talkathons, Walkathons, Nukkad Nataks, etc. were used to spread awareness about the Scheme. The Department’s strategic use of taxpayer information and data mining techniques further spurred the declarations.


    These steps resulted in a tremendous response, especially in the last two months. As a consequence, 71,726 declarations were filed up to the midnight of 30th September, 2016 with an aggregate of Rs. 67,382 Crore worth of hitherto undeclared incomes in the form of cash and other assets being declared.

    10. Indo-Swiss Exchange of Information
    India and Switzerland have an exchange of information relationship under the Indo-Swiss Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) and the Indian Competent Authority regularly pursues all the outstanding cases with Switzerland.
    As fighting the menace of Black Money stashed in offshore accounts has been a key priority area for this Government, to further this goal, the Indian Prime Minister met with the Swiss President at Geneva on 6 th June 2016 and discussed the need for expeditious exchange of information for combatting tax evasion together with an early start to negotiations on the Agreement for Automatic Exchange of Information. As a follow up, India’s Revenue Secretary and Switzerland's State Secretary for International Financial Matters met in New Delhi on 15.06.2016 and agreed to move towards an early agreement for the implementation of AEOI between the two countries. It was also decided that experts of both the countries will meet to further discuss the modalities for the reciprocal bilateral implementation of AEOI between India and Switzerland with a view to reaching an agreement at the earliest, possibly by the end of the year. This meeting was conducted on 5-6 th September 2016. The experts from both the sides agreed for the early implementation of AEOI.

    11. Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI)

    Automatic Exchange of Information is systematic and periodic transmission of “bulk” taxpayer information by the source country to the residence country, which is possible under most of the DTAAs and Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters.
    On 3 rd June 2015, India joined the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information (AEOI) under the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) based on the provisions of the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (Multilateral Convention). The AEOI standards are very wide in scope and oblige the treaty partners to exchange wide range of financial information after collecting the same from financial institutions in their country/jurisdictions including information about the ultimate controlling persons and beneficial owners of entities. Till now, 84 countries have signed MCAA for AEOI. 101 countries have committed for AEOI. From 2017 onwards, 54 countries will start exchanging information automatically. And from 2018 onwards, it is expected that another 47 countries will start exchanging information automatically.

    12. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)


    On 9 th July, 2015, India and USA signed an Inter-Governmental Agreement (“IGA”) to implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) of the USA to promote transparency between the two nations on tax matters. The Union Cabinet in its meeting on 17 th March, 2015 approved the signing and ratification of the IGA under the provisions of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) between India and USA. Under the IGA, the USA will provide certain information to India, which includes the name, address and Indian TIN of any person that is resident of India and holds a reportable financial account in USA, along with the account number and gross amount of interest, US source dividends or other income paid or credited, depending on the nature of the financial account. On the similar lines, India will also provide the information to USA.


    Reporting of information under the IGA with USA began from 30 th September, 2015 and information pertaining to the calendar year 2014 & 2015 has already been exchanged between the two countries.

    13. Implementation of AEOI under CRS and FATCA
    For implementation of AEOI and FATCA, amendment was carried out in the Income Tax Act, 1961 through Finance Act, 2014. Vide Notification No. 62 of 2015 dated 7 th August, 2015, the Income-tax Rules, 1962 have been amended by inserting Rules 114F to 114H and Form 61B. To provide guidance to the Financial Institutions and other stake holders for ensuring compliance with the reporting requirements provided in Rules 114F to 114H and Form 61B of the Income-tax Rules, 1962, a Guidance Note was issued on 31.08.2015. On this Guidance Note, feedback and comments were received from many financial institutions. Meetings were held with financial institutions, regulators and other stake holders for providing guidance for implementation. Thereafter, an updated version of the Guidance Note was released on 31.12.2015 and the latest version has been released on 31.05.2016. The new account due-diligence procedures have started from the 01.01.2016 and first reporting will be done in September 2017 for the year 2016.
    Signing of the IGA with USA and India joining the MCAA are important milestones in India’s fight against the menace of black money as it would enable the Indian tax authorities to receive financial account information of Indians from foreign countries on an automatic basis. This will also enable the Government of India to receive information about taxpayers hiding their money in offshore financial centres and tax havens through multi-layered entities with non-transparent ownership from the jurisdictions that are signatories to the MCAA and committed to the international AEOI standards.
    14. Base Erosion and Profit Shifting
    Base Erosion and Profit Shifting refers to strategies adopted by taxpayers having cross-border operations to exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules of different jurisdictions which enable them to shift profits outside the jurisdiction where the economic activities giving rise to profits are performed and where value is created. BEPS has been a cause of concern for developing and emerging economies for long as it erodes their tax base depriving them of much needed resources for developmental activities. It is also unfair to general taxpaying public and further provides an unfair competitive advantage to Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) vis-à-vis domestic companies having no opportunities for the BEPS strategies.
    India participated in the BEPS Project engaging constructively and extensively by direct participation in CFA, Working Parties and Focus Groups set up under CFA in finalizing the deliverables of BEPS Package with the twin objectives of (a) collaborating with other countries in development of recommendations to prevent base erosion and profit shifting and (b) safeguarding the interests of India and other developing countries in development of new standards.
    The major package of recommendations of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project, were endorsed by the G20-Leaders at Antalya, Turkey in November, 2015. However some elements of the BEPS Action Plan have yet to be finalised in 2016 and 2017 and the main tasks ahead relate to the implementation of the agreed package. India being a G-20 member country, and having played a very active role in the BEPS Project so far, is fully committed to conclusion of pending design of rules in certain Action Items and to ensure the successful implementation of the recommendations of BEPS Project in 2016, 2017.
    Recently, the G-20/OECD Inclusive Framework has been constituted to monitor and review the implementation of the BEPS Package of recommendations on a global basis, with participation from all the relevant jurisdictions on an equal footing. As a follow up to the call of the G-20 Finance Ministers meeting in April 2016, the first plenary meeting of the G-20/OECD Inclusive Framework was held at Kyoto from 30 th June to 1 st July 2016 and the 1 st meeting of the Steering Group of the Inclusive Framework held on 18-19 th October, 2016.
