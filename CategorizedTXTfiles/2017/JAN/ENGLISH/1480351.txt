    About 170 NGOs from all over the country met in the capital today to deliberate upon various aspects and issues relating to road safety. There was a brief presentation on the occasion to highlight the rather grim road safety scenario in the country. There were presentations and discussions on various engineering solutions to road safety and the initiatives being taken in this direction, motor vehicle engineering to ensure safety on roads and also effective trauma care. The role of NGOs in spreading public awareness about road safety issues and their participation in other road safety activities was also discussed in detail. The NGOs then shared their field experiences and suggestions with the forum.
