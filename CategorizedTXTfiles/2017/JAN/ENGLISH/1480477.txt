    Considering the issues arising out of stabilisation of the Unified Portal for employers with UAN Based simplified Electronic Challan cum Return filing system the remittance for the month of December 2016 can be paid by 20 th January 2017.


    The Portal was launched by EPFO on 23.12.2016, which helps in submission of UAN based returns and challans. It has been noticed that due to increased traffic on the portal, many employers have faced some difficulty in upfront allotment of UAN, connectivity/login issues, website slowing down and also unfamiliarity of the new processes. The Statutory dues are to be paid by 15 th of every month.
