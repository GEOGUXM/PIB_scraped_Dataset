      Ministry of Railways had accorded topmost priority to safety and a renewed effort is undertaken to attain the aspiration of ‘zero accidents’ indicated in the last budget speech of Minister of Railways. In pursuance of these objectives Minister of Railways Shri Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu has underlined the need to revisit all safety related issues, reorient the working to address systemic lacunae and to identify and attend all potential vulnerable areas in a comprehensive month long drive so as to prevent further accidents . He has also directed that concrete measures should be undertaken by all the General Managers to bring about a significant improvement in the safety performance of Indian Railways. He emphasized that these measures should be implemented and monitored personally by the General Managers and other concerned officers during the month long special ‘Safety Awareness Campaign’ which is underway from 5 th January to 5 th February, 2017.


      Accordingly, the following directions have been given:

2.    Scheduled inspections and their compliance: It must be ensured by GMs that all the scheduled safety inspections prescribed for Sr. Supervisors and Officers are conducted and immediate action is taken on the deficiencies detected during these inspections. All Zonal Railways should circulate the standard schedules of safety inspections prescribed for all Sr. Supervisors and Officers and ensure that these safety inspections, including footplate inspections, night inspections and other scheduled inspections are undertaken by all concerned. Staff and officers failing to undertake these safety inspections should be taken up. Summary of these safety inspections undertaken should be incorporated in the summary of weekly safety performance to be sent by General Managers to ED/Safety (Coordination) (by email/fax) as per the annexed format.

4.    Field inspections by GMs and DRMs : All GMs must undertake thorough safety inspections of at least one section during safety campaign of their Zonal Railway. Similarly DRMs must also undertake safety inspection of one section, other than the section being inspected by the GMs. These safety inspections should be thorough and focused.

Workshop/workplace inspections by Principal Head Of the Departments (PHOD): The concerned PHODs must inspect at least one workshop/depot/workplace of their respective area during the campaign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
6.    Night footplate inspections to cover all sections: All officers should be deputed to undertaken night footplate inspections by passenger/mail/express trains so as to cover all sections of the Division every night. HQ officers (SAGs and JAGs of all Departments) may also be given a target of at least two night time footplate inspections. Deficiencies noticed should be taken care of on the spot in coordination with the respective officers as far as possible.
