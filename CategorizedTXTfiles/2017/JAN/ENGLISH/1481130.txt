      Ministry of Steel

      Statement on minimum import price on certain Steel Products
      Posted On: 24 JAN 2017 5:50PM by PIB Delhi


    Attention is invited to some media reports quoting Union Steel Minister, which give an impression that that Minimum Import Price on steel will be discontinued after 4 Feb. 2017.

    In this connection, this is to clarify that the Minister was making a point in a wider context of providing level playing field to the Indian steel industry. Chaudhary Birender Singh had emphasized that MIP is a short-term measure & not of a permanent nature. The Government is taking permanent measures to counter unfair trade practices as per international norms. A total of 124 steel products have been covered by provisional anti-dumping duties & final orders on the same are expected in due course.

    As a result of the safeguards and anti-dumping measures, out of 173 items on which MIP was initially imposed, only 19 items are currently notified under MIP. These are relating to colour-coated steel, primarily to avoid any circumvention of the duties. Two of colour-coated steel items are already covered under anti-dumping duties.
