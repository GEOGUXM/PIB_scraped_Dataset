    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today said that the life of a NCC cadet is beyond the uniform, the parade and the camps; and added that the NCC experience provides a sense of mission. He was addressing the NCC rally in New Delhi.
    
    The Prime Minister said that the NCC experience offers a glimpse of India, its strength and its diversity. He said that emperors, rulers, governments do not make a nation, but a nation is made by its citizens, youth, farmers, scholars, scientists, workforce, and saints.
    
    He said that NCC cadets inspire confidence about the future of India, and instill pride about the strength of our youth.
    
    The Prime Minister appreciated the role of NCC in furthering the cause of cleanliness. He also called for continuing the movement towards digital transactions.
