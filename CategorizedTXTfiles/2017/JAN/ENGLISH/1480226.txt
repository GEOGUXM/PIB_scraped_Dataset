        Central Board of Excise & Customs (CBEC) has initiated the process of migration of its existing CENTRAL EXCISE/SERVICE TAX assessees to GST with effect from 9th January, 2017.
        As part of its efforts to ensure implementation of GST by 1st April, 2017, CBEC has taken steps to ensure that its existing taxpayers are migrated to GST in a simple, user-friendly and smooth manner. Once the existing registered Taxpayers (both Central Excise as well as Service Tax) login to CBECâ€™s Web Portal www.aces.gov.in, a facility will be given in a secure manner to access the provisional login ID and password given by Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN). Thereafter, using the same, they can log in to GST Portal (www.gst.gov.in) to fill the required fields and submit scanned documents.
        However, if they have already initiated the process of migration to GST as a VAT asssessee under STATE COMMERCIAL TAX department, no further action is necessary. PAN is mandatory for migration to GST. Hence, if the existing Central Excise/Service Tax Registration Code does not have PAN, then PAN has to be obtained from Income Tax Department and the Registration details have to be updated in the ACES Portal www.aces.gov.in
        CBEC has made available a 24x7 HELPDESK (TOLL-FREE NO 1800-1200-232, EMAIL: cbecmitra.helpdesk@icegate.gov.in) for the purpose of assisting existing CENTRAL EXCISE/SERVICE TAX assessees. GSTN also has a HELP DESK number: 0124-4688999 and GSTN email address is: help@gst.gov.in A Step-by-Step Taxpayers User guide for Migration is available at www.aces.gov.in and at www.cbec.gov.in
        CBEC is also sending Emails/recorded telephonic messages to all registered CENTRAL EXCISE / SERVICE TAX assessees requesting them to migrate to GST. Outreach programmes such as Awareness Workshops/ Training for CENTRAL EXCISE/SERVICE TAX assessees are being organized all over India at the Commissionerates and Divisional offices of CBEC.
        All existing CENTRAL EXCISE/SERVICE TAX assessees are requested to migrate as early as possible, latest by 31st January, 2017.
