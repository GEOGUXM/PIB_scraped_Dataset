    The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval to Alternative Mechanism, who would decide on the quantum of disinvestment in a particular Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSE) on a case by case basis subject to Government retaining 51 percent equity and management control. This is in addition to the present functions performed by Alternative Mechanism as has been approved by CCEA in August, 2014.


    This would reduce speculation and overhang and expedite the disinvestment process.
