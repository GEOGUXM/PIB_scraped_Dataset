    The Rt. Hon. Boris Johnson, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of UK, called on Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today.
    
    The Prime Minister recalled their earlier meeting during his visit to UK in November 2015, when Mr. Johnson was the Mayor of London, and congratulated him on his appointment as the Foreign Secretary.
    
    The Prime Minister said that the visit of British Prime Minister Theresa May to India in November 2016 has put in place the framework necessary to guide India-UK relations in the days to come.
    
    The Prime Minister appreciated the progress achieved in strengthening the bilateral partnership in various sectors, especially Science & Technology, Finance, and Defence & Security.
    
    The Prime Minister noted that the Indian diaspora in UK acts as a living bridge between the two countries, and is a key driver of close people-to-people relations, and hoped that both sides would continue to work together to enhance these ties.
