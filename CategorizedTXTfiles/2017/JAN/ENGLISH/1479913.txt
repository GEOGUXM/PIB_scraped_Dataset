PFMS provides various stakeholders with a real time, reliable and meaningful Management Information System and an effective Decision Support System (DSS), as part of the Digital India initiative of GoI.


      The biggest strength of PFMS is its integration with the banking network in the country. As a result, PFMS has the unique capability to push online payments to almost any beneficiary/vendor having account in any bank across the country.. At present, PFMS interface is completed with the Core Banking System (CBS) of all Public Sector Banks (26), Regional Rural Banks (54), major private sector banks (14), Reserve Bank of India, India post and Cooperative Banks (55).


      The Government has emphasized the need for improved financial management in implementation of Central government Schemes so as to facilitate Just-in-time releases and monitor the usage of funds including information on its ultimate utilization. In order to abide by the directions to implement Just-in-Time releases and monitor the end usage of funds, an action plan for universal roll-out of PFMS for Central Government schemes has been approved which inter alia includes mandatory registration of all Implementing Agencies on PFMS and mandatory use of Expenditure Advance and Transfer(EAT)module of PFMSW by all IAs.

      New Initiatives/ Achievements under Internal Audit


      · The Controller General of Accounts (CGA) has developed a risk based control framework in the form of Generic Internal Audit Manual to guide the internal audit engagements. The manual not only explain the complexities associated with the internal audit functions but also facilitates the entire process by providing audit process, templates and guidelines.


      · The work of development of 2nd version of the Generic Internal Audit Manual in association with the Institute of the Internal Auditors (IIA) India has also been commenced in November, 2016. The revised Generic Internal Audit Manual will be developed as per International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF). The revised version will also include recommendations made by the Ministry of Women and Child Development to include the guidelines on Gender Audit of Policies, Programmes and Schemes of the Government of India.


      · A directional shift in the scope and approach of internal audit has been initiated by the organization by infusing two concepts- “Risk Assessment” and Performance Evaluation” for strengthening financial management and internal controls. The line Ministries are being encouraged to plan the audit assignments by adopting the Risk Based Auditing approach. Risk Based Audit in selected Ministries is being conducted on pilot basis.


      · The organization is also focusing on the use of Computer Assisted Audit Tools for more transparency and accountability. Electronic Risk Assessment Software (e RAS), a diagnostic tool for internal audit has been developed in collaboration with NIC. This diagnostic tool [e RAS] is not only helpful to the audit in planning, sampling and conducting the audit efficiently but it is also helpful to the management / stakeholders to have a review of the functioning of their entities [PAOs only] in their offices instead of visiting these offices located at different places in different states.


      · The organization is regularly reviewing the performance of the internal audit units of the line Ministries/Departments. The Annual Review on the performance of Internal Audit Wings of Civil Ministries depicts the information on different shortcomings of the Civil Ministries in the form of observations. The Annual performance reports of the different Ministries/Departments are analyzed and summarized by the Internal Audit Division for the purposes of brevity and ease of presentation. The outcome of Internal Audit through recoveries effected in pursuance to the observations of the Internal Audit is also included to reflect the impact of Internal Audit.


      · The Annual Review for the year 2015-16 of Internal Audit conducted by the field units of the organization in the Civil Ministries/Departments have been submitted to Ministry of Finance. The audit findings have been quantified on the basis of financial implications and constitute an amount of Rs.85392.20 crore under the following categories:-

Further, the bank has to mention submission of Life Certificate by the pensioner in the payment scrolls to CPAO to enable monitoring of the same. This year to avoid the hardship to pensioners in interacting with bank branches due to demonetization, the last date of submission of Life Certificate has been extended to 15 th Jan 2017.

A link to CPENGRAMS (Centralized Pension Grievance Redress and Monitoring System) has also been provided so as to enable pensioners to lodge and track their grievances on CPENGRAMS.

      · Download facility of Special Seal Authority (PPO) from CPAO’s website by using login and password provided by CPAO has been given to pensioners. Consequently, they need not separately approach CPAO to provide copies of their SSAs issued to the banks. This facility ensures digital presence and availability of records for pensioner.
