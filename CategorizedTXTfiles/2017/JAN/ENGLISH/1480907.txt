    The First Meeting of the National Steel Consumers’ Council will be held tomorrow under the Chairmanship of the Union Steel Minister Shri Chaudhary Birender Singh in Mumbai. The function of the Steel Consumer Council is to advise Government on matters relating to supply, availability, quality and the market trends of iron and steel.


    This meeting would be attended by representatives of various ministries, several industry associations, producers and consumers of iron & steel Industry, house builders and related industries, industry experts and steel makers including SAIL, RINL and TATA Steel etc. This meeting would provide a vibrant platform to discuss the domestic steel industry scenario, the global steel trends, and benefits of using steel and on how to boost the domestic steel consumption. India has become the third largest steel producer in the world; while the domestic steel consumption remains at only 60 Kgs per capita.


    There has been continued thrust from the Ministry of Steel to boost domestic steel consumption by exploring the versatile steel uses. Recently the Steel Minister has also urged all concerned ministries to use India-made steel for government projects. The meeting comes at a good time to address all steel related issues.
