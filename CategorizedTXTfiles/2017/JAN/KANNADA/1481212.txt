    No extension beyond 31st January, 2017 to switch off analog signals in Phase III Urban Areas


      Cable Subscribers in Phase III urban areas, who have not yet taken Set Top Boxes, are advised to obtain the same from the MSO/Cable Operators in their areas immediately, failing which they would not be able to watch TV services through Cable TV Networks after 31st January, 2017.


      It is brought to the notice of all concerned that Ministry of I&B would not grant any extension beyond 31st January, 2017 to switch off analog signals in Phase III urban areas. In this connection, Chief Secretaries of all States/UTs have been requested recently to ensure that the Authorized Officer get acquainted with their powers and specified rules to enforce them against defaulters if they continue to carry analog signal in Phase III urban areas after 31st January, 2017.


      The Ministry had issued instructions to all the Broadcasters, Multi System Operators (MSOs) and Local Cable Operators (LCOs) to ensure that no analog signals are transmitted over the cable networks in Phase III urban areas after 31st January, 2017. "Authorized officers" under Sec 11 of the Cable TV Networks (Regulation) Act can seize the equipment of the MSOs/Cable Operators, if they continues to carry analog signal in Phase III urban areas after 31st January, 2017.


      On account of court proceedings, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting had earlier given time up to 31st January, 2017 to switch over to digital mode of transmission in Cable TV Networks in Phase III urban areas.
