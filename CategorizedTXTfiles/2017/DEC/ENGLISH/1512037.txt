      Clarification – Regarding DRDO-Developed Biodigesters
      Posted On: 08 DEC 2017 1:32PM by PIB Delhi


    DRDO has examined recent media reports on a study undertaken by IIT, Chennai on DRDO developed bio digesters. DRDO team has also interacted with Prof Ligy Philip who had undertaken the study. After examining the information available it emerges that the experiment design by IIT, Chennai was flawed and results of the study are inaccurate. The statement by Prof Ligy that organic matter (Human waste) collecting in the bio-digesters does not undergo any kind of treatment is factually incorrect. The investigator had not undertaken any study on bio digesters fitted in Indian Railways and the reference to the same in the news articles is false and misleading. “The study had been undertaken without interacting with DRDO and it appears that the study has been conducted without understanding how the technology works”. DRDO developed biodigester technology has been proven over the years and Indian Railways has implemented the same in a very large scale after trying out various options from India and abroad. The application for bio digester for rural sanitation has the potential to become the single most important factor for the Swach Bharat initiative.
