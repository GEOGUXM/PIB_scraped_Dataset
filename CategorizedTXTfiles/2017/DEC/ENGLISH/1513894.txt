      Posted On: 22 DEC 2017 7:13PM by PIB Delhi


    “With prime objective of enhancing standards of cleanliness, upkeep and basic amenities at beaches, this Ministry has launched a pilot project for beach cleanup and development, also striving for the “Blue Flag” Certification for such identified beaches. Under the pilot programme, each of the coastal State/UT was requested to identify/nominate a beach, to be funded through the ongoing Integrated Coastal Management Programme. All the coastal States have nominated the pilot beaches in their receptive territories including Goa. Formal nominations are, however, awaited from the coastal UTs viz., Daman & Diu, Puducherry, Lakshadweep and Andaman & Nicobar”.


    This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Mahesh Sharma, in reply to a written question in Lok Sabha today.
