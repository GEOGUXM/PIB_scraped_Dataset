      Reforms in Decentralized Procurement Scheme
      Posted On: 19 DEC 2017 3:02PM by PIB Delhi


    NITI AAYOG has been requested to study the trends in procurement of foodgrains and assess impact of Decentralized Procurement Scheme (DCP) system thereon and to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the procurement agencies under DCP System.


    Non- DCP States are regularly encouraged to take up Decentralized Procurement System (DCP) for foodgrains. However, it is implemented with the consent of concerned state.


    As on date 15 States have adopted DCP mode for procurement of Rice (Out of which Jharkhand has partially adopted DCP operation for five revenue districts).


    Further, 8 States have adopted DCP mode for procurement of Wheat (Out of which Rajasthan has partially adopted DCP operation for 9 districts. However, the State has been included in Centralized Procurement only for RMS 2017-18). Detailed list is given below in table


    A High Level Committee (HLC) under the Chairmanship of Shri Shanta Kumar was set up, to review the current system of procurement of foodgrains, marketing, storage, preservation and distribution. Based on recommendation of HLC, important actions taken are as follows:-

     1. Levy on rice millers has been abolished.
     2. The rules for registration of Negotiable Warehouse Receipts (NWRs) has been amended to streamline its functions and to increase the use of NWRs.
     3. Depot Online System is currently operational at 526 FCI depots .
     4. Special focus on procurement of paddy in Eastern States has been given resulting in increase of procurement of rice during KMS 2016-17 upto 70.70 Lakh MT against 53.65 LMT during KMS 2015-16.
     5. Private Players has been engaged by FCI to maximise the outreach of MSP operations in Eastern States,.
     6. Government of India has approved Action Plan for construction of 100 LMT silos upto 2019-20.
     7. A policy decision has been taken for non-acceptance of rice/wheat in Central Pool in the event of a surplus states declares a bonus over and above MSP.
