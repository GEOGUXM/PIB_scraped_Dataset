      Posted On: 27 DEC 2017 6:50PM by PIB Delhi


    On indigenous commercial communication INSAT/GSAT satellites, there are about 289 transponders, in various frequency bands like C, extended-C, Ku, S etc.; and about 4 Gbps HTS capacity.


    As on date, all confirmed demands up to December, 2018 are being fulfilled, except for DTH requirements and three transponders in C and extended-C bands. Requirements for C and extended-C bands are being addressed. DTH requirements are expected to be addressed through upcoming planned satellites over a period of next 2-3 years.


    Two satellites are likely to reach end of life in about next 24 months. The replacement satellites are planned to be available in time as replace capacity.


    In addition to 7 orbital slots that are currently in use, to operate 15 satellites, actions are initiated with International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to acquire additional orbital slots to address future requirements.


    This was stated by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.
