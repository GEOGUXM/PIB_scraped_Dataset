      Posted On: 22 DEC 2017 7:11PM by PIB Delhi


    “Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has carried out inspection of polluting industries to check the compliance of stipulated norms of effluent & emission discharge. Based on the compliance status of industries, directions are issued and in case of major violations, closure directions under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 are issued. Closure directions have been issued to 73 industries falling under 17 categories of industries since last one year in various States. In addition, closure directions to 508 Grossly Polluting Industrial (GPI) units situated along Ganga were issued under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.
    
    No decision has been taken to legislate a new law imposing heavy penalty and imprisonment instead of closing polluting units.”
    
    This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Mahesh Sharma, in reply to a written question in Lok Sabha today.
