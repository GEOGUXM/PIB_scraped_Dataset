      2.82 lakh Fair Price Shops Install PoS devices so far
      Posted On: 15 DEC 2017 3:52PM by PIB Delhi


    The website www.annavitran.nic.in is functional and is used to monitor the electronic transactions happening at the Fair Price Shops for the distribution of foodgrains to NSFA beneficiaries with the help of PoS devices. As per information received from States/UTs out of total 5.27 lakh FPSs, more than 2.82 lakh FPSs have been automated so far. State/UT wise statement is at Annexure.


    The purposes of installing electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) devices at FPSs are authentication of beneficiaries and electronic recording of subsidised foodgrain distribution to beneficiaries.


    As compared to earlier practice of manual record-keeping of the transactions, the ePoS based transactions have the advantage that the FPS dealers are not required to manually make separate/repetitive entries of foodgrain distribution in registers and ration cards of the beneficiaries.


    Connectivity to ePoS devices at FPSs is ensured by State/UT Governments. In case connectivity is not there ePoS devices can also work in offline mode.


    In accordance with The Food Security (Assistance to State Governments) Rules, 2015 under NFSA, GoI is providing financial assistance to States/UTs for installation of ePoS devices at the rate of Rs. 17/quintal of foodgrains distributed through ePoS devices, towards the expenditure incurred for the purchase, operations and maintenance of the ePoS devices. Such expenditure would be shared between Centre and State Governments on 75:25 basis for special category States/UTs and on 50:50 basis for General category States/UTs.
