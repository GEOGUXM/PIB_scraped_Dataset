      * Food Street - curated by celebrity Chef Shri Sanjeev Kapoor, Food Street was World Food India’s most attractive highlight. Food Street was set up as an experiential platform that brought together culinary practices, flavours, fragrances from the world's cuisines, and celebrated India's rich cultural heritage and diverse uniqueness of its produce to create contemporary renditions and fusion food. A Guinness book record was established during the event for Chefs preparing 918 kg of nutritious Khichdi noted as the ubiquitous comfort, wellness food. The Minister of Food Processing Industries Smt Badal also appealed to each individual to take a pledge – ‘NO WASTE ON MY PLATE’- to make India Food Secure.


        * MoFPI’s International Participation - MoFPI showcased India’s strength in Food Processing Industries by participating in international food exhibitions such as Salon International de l’ALimentation (SIAL) in France and as a partner country in Allgemeine Nahrungs Und Genußmittel Ausstellung (ANUGA) in Germany.


      It was also an honour for India to be a partner country for the international event ANUGA held at Cologne, Germany in October 2017. Buoyed with the idea of Food diplomacy to bridge differences and to transform the lives of farmers, Smt Badal reiterated that Development of Food Processing Industries will help in achieving the target of doubling farmers’ income by 2022. Upgrading our farming techniques and investments not only in Food Processing but also in Farming technologies, need to learn from the West on how to control wastage at harvest and transportation level were the guiding aims in participating at the international events.


      * Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAMPADA Yojana


    On 23 rd August 2017 the Schemes of the Ministry were restructured and new schemes were approved by Cabinet and launched as Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAMPADA Yojana . The SAMPADA Scheme aims to target creation of Infrastructure and increasing capacities of processing and preservation in entire supply chain of food processing sector right from farm gate to retail outlets. The New Scheme will help in integrating food processing units and food trade with the farmers creating huge opportunities for employment of increasing income of the farmers. PMKSY is an umbrella scheme incorporating ongoing schemes of the Ministry like Mega Food Parks, Integrated Cold Chain and Value Addition Infrastructure, Food Safety and Quality Assurance Infrastructure, etc. and also new schemes like Infrastructure for Agro-processing Clusters, Creation of Backward and Forward Linkages, Creation / Expansion of Food Processing & Preservation Capacities.


      * Other Significant Administrative decisions

          + Food and agro-based processing unit and cold chain infrastructure have been classified under agriculture activities for Priority Sector Lending . Availability of additional credit for food processing activities and infrastructure.

          + Service Tax on pre-conditioning, pre-coding, ripening, waxing, retail packaging and labelling of fruits and vegetables exempted in cold chain projects . This is a big relief in terms of tax exemption to the cold chain operators as this facility was only available to the farmers at farm gate but not to the cold chain operators. This enhanced the viability of cold chain projects, encouraging more investment in the sector.


          + To enhance the transparency and reduce human interface on-line software has been developed and put in use for filing of claims for the infrastructure development projects. This has also being expanded to other schemes.


          + Investment tracking and facilitation Desk of Invest India has been set up in the Ministry. The desk will identify new potential investors and approach them in a focussed and structured manner for investment and follow-up the investment cases by providing hand holding services. The desk will also assist Ministry in organising roadshows both in India and abroad and organising investment meets.


          + A Dairy Processing and Development Fund of Rs. 8000 core set up in NABARD . The Fund is used to modernize old and obsolete milk processing units particularly in cooperative sector and will result in enhancing milk processing capacity thereby adding more value to the produce of the farmers and increasing their income


          + Common Food Processing Incubation Center for Shallots inaugurated in Perambalur


      * Additional fiscal concessions:

          + Provisions in Budget 2016-17
      * Reduction in Excise Duty on Refrigerated Containers from 12.5% to 6%.
      * Reduction in Basic Custom Duty on Refrigerated Containers from 10% to 5%.
      * 5% Basic Customs Duty as presently available under project imports for cold storage, cold room also extended for Cold Chain including pre-cooling unit, pack house, sorting and grading lines and ripening chambers.
      * Excise Duty on Machinery reduced from 10% to 6%.

          + Mega Food Parks: Ministry of Food Processing Industries is focusing on boosting the food processing industry so that agriculture sector grows exponentially and become a major contributor to doubling the farmer’s income and aid ‘Make In India’ initiative of the government. To give a major boost to the food processing sector by adding value and reducing food wastage at each stage of the supply chain with particular focus on perishables, Ministry of Food Processing Industries is implementing Mega Food Park Scheme in the country. Mega Food Parks create modern infrastructure facilities for food processing along the value chain from farm to market with strong forward and backward linkages through a cluster based approach. Common facilities and enabling infrastructure is created at Central Processing Centre and facilities for primary processing and storage is created near the farm in the form of Primary Processing Centers (PPCs) and Collection Centers (CCs).Under the Scheme, Government of India provides financial assistance upto Rs. 50 Crore per Mega Food Park project.

      * Under the Scheme of Setting up/ Modernization of Abattoirs, one project at Panaji (Goa) has been operationalised.

      * 10 Food Testing Labs have been completed.

      * On 31 August 2017, a Common Food Processing Incubation Center for Shallots launched at Perambalur i n collaboration with Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology (IIFPT). Farmers in Perambalur District are producing 70000 tons of shallots per year in a cultivation area of 8000 hectares, in spite of the increasing difficulty in cultivation due to increase in prices of inputs, unpredictable weather, disease outbreak and not getting adequate prices in the market. Thus the Central Processing Center for Shallots in Perambalur was started to ensure that no shallots are getting wasted, increase farmers' income and also ensure availability of shallots to consumers.


        * GST Facilitation Cell The Ministry of Food Processing Industries established a four member GST Facilitation Cell at its office to guide the industry about the new tax regime. The ministry created the GST cell for the purpose of implementation and facilitating the rollout of GST with immediate effect. The GST facilitation cell provides all possible support for the rollout of the levy to the major industry and business associations related to MoFPI. This cell serves as the first point of contact to address any issue being faced by any sector related to the ministry. The GST cell will be equipped with the complete knowledge of the relevant GST Act, rules, rate structure etc. The members of the GST Facilitation Cell can be accessed through Toll Free No 1800111175 or on #AskonGSTFPI. Further details can be accessed from http://www.mofpi.nic.in


      * To aid MoFPI’s objectives, FSSAI simplified product approval:

     1. Approved a large number of new Additives harmonized with the International Codex Standards.
     2. Notified an amendment to the regulations as a result of which non-standardized food products called proprietary foods (except novel food and nutraceuticals) that use ingredients and additives approved in the regulations will no longer require product approval. This has provided considerable relief to the industry.

      * The National Institute of Food Technology, Entrepreneurship and Management (NIFTEM) at Kundli, Sonepat, Haryana and Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology (IIFPT) at Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu are being developed by the Government as the Centres of Excellence. The pass-outs of these institutes have got 100% placements.


      * FSSAI, the apex Regulatory body for Food Safety in India announced a powerful new tool called ‘the Food Regulatory Portal .’ Planned as a single interface for food businesses to cater to both domestic operations and food imports, this portal would be a game changer for effective and transparent implementation of the food safety laws in the country. Aiming to create an enabling environment for businesses to operate, the portal is strategically aligned with Government’s mission of One Nation, One Food Law.


      * National Food Processing Policy.


    Approach Paper on the National Food Processing Policy has been uploaded on MoFPI website and suggestions are invited from all stakeholders and general public. National Food Processing Policy shall focus on building India’s NATIONAL FOOD GRID and NATIONAL COLD CHAIN GRID and create Retail Markets every nook and corner of the country.
