    The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act) has been enacted by repealing the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 to make comprehensive provisions for children alleged and found to be in conflict with law and children in need of care and protection, taking into consideration the standards prescribed in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice, 1985 (the Beijing Rules), the United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty (1990), the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter country Adoption (1993), and other related international instruments.


    The revised Act has come into effect from 15.01.2016. The new ‘JJ Act’ includes special provisions to address heinous offences committed by children above the age of 16 years. For the first time, offences have been clearly defined and classified in the Act as petty, serious and heinous. Special provisions have been made to tackle child offenders committing heinous offences in the age group of 16-18 years, which will act as a deterrent. Apart from this t he JJ Act, focuses on various measures for rehabilitation and reintegration of children in difficult circumstances, including children in conflict with law. The JJ Act and the Central Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules, 2016 thereunder, provide for setting up of a network of services and structures for ensuring the well being and rehabilitation of such children which includes Juvenile Justice Boards, Special Juvenile Police Units, State and District Child Protection Units, Homes of various types and non-institutional care through adoption, foster-care and sponsorship. These measures among other things also intend main streaming of children in conflict with law and there by reducing crimes by the minors. The State Governments/UT Administrations are entrusted with the primary responsibility for implementation of the JJ Act.
