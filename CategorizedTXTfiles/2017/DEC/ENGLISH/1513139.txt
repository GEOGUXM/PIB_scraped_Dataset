    Government has approved setting up of a total 42 Mega Food Parks in the country to create modern infrastructure for food processing. Out of these, 9 Mega Food Parks have become functional till date and Ministry has targeted to make 6 more Mega Food Parks functional in this financial year and 12 more by the next financial year.


    Mega Food Park has been designed on hub and spokes model in which Central Processing Centre (CPC), with enabling and common facilities for use by a cluster of units, is networked with multiple spokes of primary processing centres and collection centres located in the catchment area for aggregation and collection of farmersâ€™ produce to feed the CPC. It is seen that a Mega Food Park has helped in creating demand for farmers produce, better remuneration, increasing level of processing and value addition, reducing wastage and creating opportunities directly and indirectly benefitting thousands of farmers and youths.


    This information was laid in Lok Sabha today by the Union Minister of Food Processing Industries, Smt. Harsimrat Kaur Badal
