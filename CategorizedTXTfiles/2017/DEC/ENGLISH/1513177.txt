    Minister of State (IC) for Power and New & Renewable Energy,Shri Raj Kumar Singh, in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today, informed that the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy has received representations conveying that consignments of solar panels imported from other countries are held up at some of the ports due to Customs Classification issues resulting in disputes regarding the applicable rate of Basic Customs Duty on the imported solar panels.


    As informed by the Customs Authorities, the Government has put in place remedial measures by way of permission for bonding the cargo under Section 49 of the Customs Act, so as to avoid demurrage and detention charges. Also, the solar panels are allowed the benefit of provisional release under Section 110A of the Customs Act, Shri Singh added.
