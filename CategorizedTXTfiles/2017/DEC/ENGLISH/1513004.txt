      Posted On: 18 DEC 2017 3:54PM by PIB Delhi


    1. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation has two wings, one relating to Statistics and the other Programme Implementation. The Statistics Wing called the National Statistical Office(NSO) consists of the Central Statistical Office (CSO), the Computer centre and the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). The Programme Implementation Wing has three Divisions, namely, (i) Twenty Point Programme (ii) Infrastructure Monitoring and Project Monitoring and (iii) Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme. Besides these two wings, there is National Statistical Commission created through a Resolution of Government of India (MOSPI) and one autonomous Institute, viz., Indian Statistical Institute declared as an institute of National importance by an Act of Parliament.


    2. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation attaches considerable importance to coverage and quality aspects of statistics released in the country. The statistics released are based on administrative sources, surveys and censuses conducted by the Central and State Governments and non-official sources and studies. The surveys conducted by the Ministry are based on scientific sampling methods. Field data are collected through dedicated field staff. In line with the emphasis on the quality of statistics released by the Ministry, the methodological issues concerning the compilation of national accounts are overseen Committees like Advisory Committee on National Accounts, Standing Committee on Industrial Statistics, Technical Advisory Committee on Price Indices. The Ministry compiles data sets based on current data, after applying standard statistical techniques and extensive scrutiny and supervision.


    3. India is a subscriber to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) and is currently fulfilling the Standards. The Ministry maintains an ‘Advance Release Calendar’ for its data categories covered under the SDDS, which is disseminated on the Ministries website as well as on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) of the IMF. The Ministry releases the data sets covered under the Real Sector of SDDS through press notes, Press Information Bureau Press releases and its web-site simultaneously. The Ministry has been designated as the nodal Ministry to facilitate the implementation of the SAARC Social Charter in India. The Ministry organizes technical meetings on a regular basis on various topics to assess the data-gaps in the system and the quality of statistics currently released. The CSO staff participates in meetings and seminars organized by international and regional organizations such as the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, on statistical compilations and international practices. The Indian statistical system is one of the best systems in the world. The Ministries officials have been associated with international agencies on the development of methodologies, particularly in the areas of national accounts, informal sector statistics, large-scale sample surveys, conduct of censuses, service sector statistics, non-observed economy, social sector statistics, environmental statistics and classifications. The contribution of the Ministries officials in international meetings on these subjects is highly appreciated.


    4. This year has been very significant year in terms of major policy decisions and adoption of new technology and systems for more efficient and effective data management and dissemination. Following are the major highlights of the activities of the Ministry during the year 2017:


     1. United Nations Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics


    § Adopted since June 2016, to enhance professional independence, impartiality, accountability and transparency in methods of collection and dissemination of Official Statistics;

    § Large scale employment surveys in India have so far been conducted usually at 5-year intervals.


    § PLFS launched in April 2017 to obtain employment data at shorter intervals.


    § PLFS aims to –


    (i) Measure quarterly changes in statistical indicators of labour market in Urban Areas;


    (ii) Generate annual estimates of labour force indicators in both Rural and Urban Areas.

      * PLFS will use the Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) technique, which involves direct entry of data in Tablets at the field level. This will lead to higher accuracy and faster processing of data.

    VI. Collection of Statistics (Amendment) Bill 2017

     1. Use of technology in data collection


    § Computer Assisted Personnel Interviewing ( CAPI ) technique for data collection through tablets will be used in PLFS


    § Web-portal for collection of data directly from data source for the Annual Survey of Industries ( ASI )


    § Submission of online data for Consumer price Index ( CPI ) – By NSSO field offices for urban areas and by designated Post offices for rural areas


    § These measures lead to reduction in time lag in compilation and release of data.
