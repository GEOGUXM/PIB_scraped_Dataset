    A group of 18 students from Bishnupur district of Manipur attending the National Integration Tour, organised by the 42 nd Assam Rifles, called on the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju here today. The tour is being organized from December 14-26, 2017 to the National Capital and Agra.


    Speaking on the occasion, Shri Rijiju complimented the Assam Rifles for organizing the National Integration Tour under the Operation Sadbhavna, giving children from the remote region an opportunity to visit the national capital and other historic cities to discover the grandeur of India.


    While interacting with the students, Shri Rijiju said that the National Integration Tour is a good initiative taken by the Assam Rifles since this is the first visit outside the state for a majority of these students. He called upon the children to share their experiences with family and friends back home.


    The aim of the National Integration Tour is to promote harmony and awareness. The tour is aimed at integrating the students with the nation and promoting concept of unity in diversity. The students are visiting landmarks like the Taj Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri, forts in Agra and Delhi, Rajghat, India Gate, National Museum, Pragati Maidan and Delhi Metro.
