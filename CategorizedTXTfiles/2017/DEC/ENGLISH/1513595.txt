      Restoration of Ponds
      Posted On: 21 DEC 2017 2:55PM by PIB Delhi


      As per the 4 th Minor Irrigation Census conducted by this Ministry, there are 5,23,816 water bodies in the rural areas being used for minor irrigation. Of these 4,43,688 water bodies were in use and 80,128 were not in use. Reasons given by States for water bodies not being in use are- encroachments, urbanisation, polluted water, non availability of water due to less and erratic rainfall, siltation etc. State-wise details are given below.


      Sedimentation of ponds is one of the various reasons of decline in ground water level in nearby areas.


      Works related to water resources development & management are primarily planned, funded, executed and maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priorities. In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes such as Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) and scheme for Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of water bodies etc.


      Till date 12424 water bodies (1085 in pilot scheme, 10855 in XI plan and 484 thereafter) have been revived under this scheme. Central Assistance to the tune of Rs.4280.80 crore (Rs.197.30 crore in pilot scheme, Rs.3818.83 crore in XI plan and Rs.264.67 crore thereafter) has been released to various States under this scheme.
