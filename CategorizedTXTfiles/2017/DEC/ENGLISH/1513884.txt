      As per Section 2 (14) (vi) of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act), a child who does not have parents and no one is willing to take care of, or whose parents have abandoned or surrendered him is included as a child in need of care and protection. And a s per Section 2 ( 57 ), of JJ Act, a “Specialised Adoption Agency” (SAA) means an institution established by the State Government or by a voluntary or non-governmental organisation and recognized under section 65, for housing orphans, abandoned and surrendered children, placed there by order of the Committee, for the purpose of adoption. Further as per Regulation 58 of Adoption Regulation, 2017, all Child Care Institutions (CCIs) which are not recognized as SAAs shall have linkages with CCI in the district. The primary responsibility in execution of the JJ Act lies with the State Governments. However Central Govt is executing a scheme namely Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS) (now “Child protection Services”) for providing financial assistance to State Governments/UT Administrations, on sharing pattern, for execution of the Act and with the objective to create a safe and secure environment for overall development of children in need of care and protection, which includes orphan/abandoned/surrendered children.


      Under “ Child protection Services”, financial assistance is provided to State Governments /UT Administrations for setting up and managing Child Care Institutions (CCIs) by themselves or in association with Voluntary Organisations/Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). The details of NGOs of State/UT which are getting grants under the ICPS for maintenance of Child Care Institutions (CCIs) through State Governments/UT Administrations concerned is as below.
