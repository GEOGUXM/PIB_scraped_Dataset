    *Data up to Oct.-2016


    A nationwide baseline assessment was carried out in 2016 which indicated 2672 functional blood banks in the country, inequitably distributed across all States.


    The blood banks are clustered in urban and semi-urban locations in all districts barring 74 in accordance with availability of secondary and tertiary health infrastructure in both government and private sectors especially to manage conditions such as genetic blood disorders, cancer and complex surgeries where there is greater need for blood.


    As per WHO norms, if 1-3 % of population donates, the basic blood requirement of a country can be met. There is no norm for number of blood banks per million population.


    Health is a State subject. Under National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to States including for strengthening blood services and setting up blood banks in district hospitals as per proposals received from State Governments in their Programme Implementation plans.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
