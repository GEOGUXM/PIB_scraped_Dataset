      Toilets for Transgenders
      Posted On: 28 DEC 2017 5:35PM by PIB Delhi


    The Registrar General of India (RGI), during Enumeration of Census 2011, for the first time provided three codes i.e. Male-1, Female â€“2 and others -3 for enumeration. This was at the discretion of the respondent. In case the respondent wished to record neither '1' nor '2', then enumerator was instructed to record sex as 'other' and give code '3'. Still, it is important to note that the Census on India does not collect any data specifically on 'transgender'. Thus, the category of 'other' would not only include 'transgender' but also any person who desires to record sex under the category of 'other'. It is also possible that some transgenders would have returned themselves either male or female depending upon their choice. The population of 'other' as per Census 2011 is 4,87,803.
    
    In order to provide for protection of rights of transgender persons and their welfare, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has introduced a Bill in the Lok Sabha titled "The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016". The Bill stipulates that the appropriate Government shall formulate welfare schemes and programmes which are transgender sensitive, non-stigmatising and non-discriminatory and shall also take steps to secure their full and effective participation and inclusion in the society.
    
    This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Vijay Sampla in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
