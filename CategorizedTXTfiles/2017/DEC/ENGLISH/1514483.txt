    Scheme for Adolescent Girls was sanctioned in the year 2010 and is implemented in 205 districts across the country. Government has approved expansion and universalisation of the Scheme for Adolescent Girls in a phased manner i.e. in additional 303 districts in 2017-18 and the remaining districts in 2018-19 with the simultaneous phasing out of Kishori Shakti Yojana. Thus at present, 508 districts in the country are covered under Scheme for Adolescent Girls. In the identified areas of remaining districts KSY is implemented.


    All the districts in the States including North-Eastern region are covered under the scheme in its phased expansion.
