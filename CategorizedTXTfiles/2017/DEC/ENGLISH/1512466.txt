      Posted On: 13 DEC 2017 3:41PM by PIB Delhi


    The Ministry of Electronics and IT has been working to translate Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas , through digital inclusion. Digital India program was launched by the Government to ensure digital service delivery to the common people as well as to create new opportunities in the digital economy. Schemes such as BPO Promotion and Common Services Centres have helped us create digital inclusion and equitable growth.


    G rowth of IT sector in India has traditionally remained confined to a few select urban clusters. Urban pockets like Delhi-NOIDA-Gurugram, Mumbai-Pune, Hyderabad, Bengaluru-Mysore and Chennai saw the concentration of majority of the IT companies. In 2014, it was decided to work towards spreading IT jobs across small towns of India. The objective was to create opportunities for the youth living in these areas so that they do not need to migrate to urban clusters. As a result, the India BPO Promotion Scheme was conceived. Given the special focus of the Government to develop the North East regions of India, the North East BPO Promotion Scheme was also conceived simultaneously.


    The schemes provide special incentives of upto Rs. 1 lakh per seat in the form of Viability Gap Funding (VGF). Disbursement of financial support under these schemes is directly linked with employment generation. These schemes provide special incentives for employment to women and Divyang, setting up operations in towns other than capital towns, generating employment beyond target and promoting local entrepreneurship. There are also special provisions for the Himalayan states of Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.
