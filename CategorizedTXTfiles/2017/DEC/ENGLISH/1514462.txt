         Scheme for Setting up of 750 MW Grid - connected Solar PV Power Projects under Batch - 1 of Phase - II of JNNSM with Viability Gap Funding Support                 The selection of the bidders has been based on the Viability Gap Funding ( VGF ) required for the project in an ascending order upto the full capacity . Viability Gap Funding ( VGF ) is limited to 30 % of the project cost or 2 . 5 crore per MW, whichever is lower . Solar Energy Corporation of India ( SECI ) has signed PPA with such project developers for purchasing entire power from the project for 25 years at 5 . 45 Rs . per unit ( 4 . 75 Rs . per unit for projects availing accelerated depreciation ).
