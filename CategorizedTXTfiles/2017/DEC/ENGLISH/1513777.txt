    In view of the growing need of the Indian Economy, Government of India has embarked upon a massive programme to provide 24x7 power across the country by 2019. After the completion of half of its term, the Government has achieved many important milestones in the Power sector. Special focus has been given to Rural Electrification, under Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY); and Urban Electrification under Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS). The schemes have been now oriented towards individual household electrification by March 2019, under SAUBHAGYA scheme.


    Several landmark decisions have already been taken in thermal power generation, hydel and more importantly in solar, wind and other green energy, besides strengthening of transmission and distribution, separation of feeder and metering of power to consumers. These also include not only achievements in capacity addition but also important reforms being undertaken on increasing energy efficiency of the present infrastructure and thereby reducing power losses, including increasing accountability and transparency by launching Mobile applications and websites like URJA app, SAUBHAGYA portal, National Power Portal, MERIT portal etc.


    The details of Year-long achievements for Ministry of Power are as below:

     1. Energy Conservation

    National LED Programme


    Hon ’ ble Prime Minister, on 5 th January, 2015 launched the National LED Programme with the aim of promoting use of the most efficient lighting technology at affordable rates . This programme has two components ( i ) Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LED for All ( UJALA ) to provide LED bulbs to domestic consumers with a target to replace 77 crore incandescent bulbs with LED bulbs and ( ii ) Street Lighting National Programme ( SLNP ) to replace 1 . 34 crore conventional street lights with smart and energy efficient LED street lights by March, 2019 .


    EESL has evolved a service model to enable municipalities to replace conventional lights with LEDs at no upfront cost . The balance cost is recovered through the municipalities by monetising the energy savings . Similarly, for domestic lights, EESL service model enables domestic households to procure LED lights at an affordable price of Rs . 10 /- each and the balance on easy instalment from their electricity bill .


    The current progress of implementation of the National LED programme up to 18 th December 2017 since its launch on 5 th January 2015 is as follows :
