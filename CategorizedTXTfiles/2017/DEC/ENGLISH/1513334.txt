      Conduct of National Anthem and National Song
      Posted On: 20 DEC 2017 4:08PM by PIB Delhi


    The singing/playing of National Anthem on various occasions and need for paying due respect to the National Anthem by observance of proper decorum on such occasions are regulated by ‘Orders relating to the National Anthem of India’ and ‘The Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971’. Government has been sending Advisory to all States/UTs from time to time to comply with the instructions in this regard. It was the desire of the Constituent Assembly of India, as expressed in the form of a statement made by its President on the 24 th January, 1950, that the song Vande Mataram which has played a historic part in the struggle for Indian freedom, shall be honoured equally with the National Anthem, and shall have equal status with it. Government hopes that every citizen of India will remember the historic role of the song in our freedom struggle and show due respect to the song when it is played or sung.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in written reply to a question by Shri M.P. Veerendra Kumar in the Rajya Sabha today.
