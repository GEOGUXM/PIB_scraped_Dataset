    In a significant show of strength, formations of Southern Command are conducting a major exercise called ‘HAMESHA VIJAYEE’ in the deserts of Rajasthan from 16 to 22 December 2017 to evaluate the capability of the armed forces to strike deep into enemy territory in an integrated air-land battle.


    Units of the formations have been undergoing training for past two months to hone their skills and tactics. After the preparatory training, a large number of troops along with tanks and other armoured vehicles duly supported by overwhelming land and air based firepower have commenced conducting fully integrated operational manoeuvres to validate their operational plans.


    Unique in scope and scale, the exercise being conducted in battle like conditions, aims at fine tuning surveillance and destruction mechanisms to support precision strikes and manoeuvres by network enabled forces. With emphasis on joint operations, the exercise would test robust sensor to shooter grids by employing a vast array of surveillance and air assets networked with land based strategic and tactical vectors. Besides conventional warfare, troops will also be rehearsed to operate in the back drop of chemical and nuclear contingencies.


    The exercise showcasing a high degree of synergy between the Army and Air Force along with new generation aviation assets of the army will be reviewed by a large number of senior officers of both the Services to obtain inputs for further refinement of operational procedures.


    The Southern Command undertakes such exercises at regular intervals to ensure a high degree of battle readiness as well as validation of operational plans using modern weapons and equipment.
