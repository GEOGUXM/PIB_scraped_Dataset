      Repatriation of Chakmas From North-East States
      Posted On: 20 DEC 2017 3:59PM by PIB Delhi


    The presence of Chakmas in Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram is being resented by local population who hold them not to be original inhabitants of these States. While in Arunachal Pradesh their inclusion in electoral rolls and conferment of citizenship on them are being opposed, the Mizos are wary of the growth in Chakma population in Mizoram.


    There is no plan at present to resume Indo-Bangladesh dialogue on repatriating Chakmas from North-East States.


    A Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 proposing amendment in the definition of ‘illegal migrants’ u/s 2(1)(b), reducing the residency period from 11 to 6 years under the Third Schedule of Section 6 and giving enabling powers to the Government to cancel the OCI card of such persons who are found to have committed offences u/s 7D of the Citizenship Act, 1955 was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 19.07.2016 and has been referred to the Joint Parliamentary Committee. The Committee has held meetings with stakeholders and have visited States of Gujarat and Rajasthan. The Bill intends to enable minority communities of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, viz. Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians who entered India on or before 31.12.2014 due to religious persecution or fear of religious persecution to obtain Indian citizenship. The Committee is yet to submit its report.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in written reply to a question by Shri Ronald Sapa Tlau in the Rajya Sabha today.
