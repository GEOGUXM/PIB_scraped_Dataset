      Posted On: 27 DEC 2017 4:50PM by PIB Delhi


    Special trains are, normally, operated on a to and fro basis to clear extra rush of passengers traffic keeping in view the pattern of traffic, commercial justification, operational feasibility and availability of resources. However, Indian Railways operates one way special trains only in emergent situation like for clearance of unexpected extra rush to avoid any untoward incidents, to clear passenger affected due to derailment of trains, for the rescue of accident affected train passengers etc. Moreover, all sincere efforts are made to achieve optimum revenue from every special train service.


    Analysis of occupancy pattern of trains is done on regular basis. On those sectors, where there is heavy unsatisfied demand, subject to operational feasibility, efforts are made to augment the load of existing trains or to run special trains to meet the seasonal rush. Fully unreserved trains are also run to cater to unreserved traffic during the rush period.


    During festivals like Chhath etc. holding areas for passengers are created within station premises outside the ticketing area to ease the rush at the ticketing counters and platforms and facilitate easy procurement of tickets by sale of tickets in such areas. Further, Zonal Railways have been authorized to increase the charge of platform tickets or to stop the sale of platform tickets during the festivals in order to reduce the crowd at the platforms. Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel are also deployed to regulate entry of passengers in unreserved coaches during the rush period.


    This Press Release is based on the information given by the Minister of State for Railways Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha on 27.12.2017 (Wednesday).
