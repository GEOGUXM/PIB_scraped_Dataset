    Further, the Ministry of Labour and Employment is contemplating to formulate a National policy on Domestic Workers. The policy is still in the draft stage.


    This information was given by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Union Minister of State (I/C) for Labour and Employment in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
