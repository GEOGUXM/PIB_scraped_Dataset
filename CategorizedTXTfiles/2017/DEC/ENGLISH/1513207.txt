    Ministry of Railways is actively working to provide 100% LED lighting for its most of the Non-traction Energy needs like Railway Staff Colonies, Railway Stations, Railway Platforms etc. Under this 100% LED initiative, Ministry of Railways has decided to make all railway stations 100% LED lit by the end of current financial year i.e. by 31 st March, 2018. It is a huge initiative to provide energy efficient lighting which will eventually greatly help in conservation of environment as well.


    Till date (i.e. till November 2017) about 3500 Railway stations have already been provided with 100% LED lights & all balance stations & Railway buildings will be completed in the current fiscal year. So far about 20 Lakh LED lights at stations have been replaced across various Zonal Railways under this programme. To take ahead provision of LED lights at all stations, ESCO mode in this area is also being pursued. A policy directive in this reference has been formulated and issued by Ministry of Railways. 100% LED lighting will hence improve the energy scene on Indian Railways and will reduce consumption by about 10% of total energy being utilized for its Non-traction uses, thus leading to savings of about 240 million units of electricity which will save about ₹180 Cr. annually to Railways.


    With these initiatives in combination with several others in 2016-’17, 5.5% reduction was achieved in non-traction energy consumption in the year 2016-17 i.e. 4.1% reduction in energy consumption despite increase in load by 1.4% thus giving a savings of ₹ 100 Cr. In the current year (6 months period i.e. April- September 2017) 7% reduction in non-traction energy consumption had already been achieved giving savings of ₹ 62 Cr. This in-fact was a quantum jump against the earlier average of 2% and transformed Energy Saving Pattern for railways.


    Ministry of Railways has also issued directives to Zonal Railways to provide LED light fittings to residential quarters as well. Zonal Railways have already distributed about 20 lac LED luminaries to railway staff till October, 2017 under Domestic Efficient Lighting Programme (DELP) Scheme.


    In addition, Indian Railways is also aiming to provide Energy efficient LED lights on all Railway coaches/EMU as well. Policy for use only LED lights in all Railway coaches has already been issued & Zonal Railways are preparing action plan. Already, 1300 non-AC second-class & 3-tier sleeper ( GSCN) coaches have been converted with 100% LED lights.
