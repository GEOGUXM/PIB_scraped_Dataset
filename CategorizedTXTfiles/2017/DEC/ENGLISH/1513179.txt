    During the current Sugar Season 2017-18, crushing operations in all major sugar producing States has commenced smoothly. The total sugar production is estimated to be around 249 lakh MT by the end of the season against estimated consumption requirement of about 250 lakh MT. However with the carry over stock, the total availability of sugar is sufficient to meet the estimated domestic requirement. As such, there will be smooth availability of sugar and the sugar prices in the domestic market are expected to remain stable at reasonable levels.


    Given the current comfortable position of production and in order to further smoothen the supply chain for easy availability of sugar in all regions, Government has withdrawn stock holding and turnover limits on dealers of sugar with immediate effect.
