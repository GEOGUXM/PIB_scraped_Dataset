    Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa, Chief of the Air Staff is on an official visit to Sri Lanka from 11-14 Dec 17, to deliberate on matters of mutual interest related to regional security. During the visit, CAS would also review the Commissioning, Award of Wings and Passing Out Parade of the Sri Lankan Air Force Academy which is scheduled to be held on 14 Dec 17. It is the first occasion in the history of the Sri Lankan Air Force where an Air Chief of a foreign Air Force is invited to review the prestigious passing out parade.


    This visit of the Indian Air Chief would provide impetus towards increasing defence cooperation between the two Air Forces and pave the way for greater interaction in the future. This would also strengthen relationships, enable engagement in productive exchanges and promote understanding of joint issues and challenges.
