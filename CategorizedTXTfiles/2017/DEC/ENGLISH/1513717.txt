      Posted On: 21 DEC 2017 5:51PM by PIB Delhi


    Government has decided to impose 30% import duty on Chana (Chickpeas) and Masoor (Lentils), with immediate effect.Production of Chana (Chickpeas) and Masoor (Lentils) are expected to be high during the forthcoming Rabi season, and cheap imports, if allowed unabated, are likely to adversely affect the interest of the farmers. Taking these factors into consideration and to protect the interest of the farmers Government has decided to increase the said import duty.
    
    At present, tur attract 10% import duty. Further, Government has recently imposed 50% import duty on yellow peas. Other pulses, however, attract Nil import duty. There has been a record production of pulses in the current year. However, despite sufficient domestic availability, import of pulses continue to take place on account of low prevailing international prices. Such imports suppress the domestic prices of pulses and adversely affect the interest of farmers.
    
    Notification number 93/2017-Customs dated 21.12.2017 has been issued in this regard.
