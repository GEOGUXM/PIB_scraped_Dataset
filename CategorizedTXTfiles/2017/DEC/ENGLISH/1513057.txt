      Status of BBIN Motor Vehicle Agreement
      Posted On: 18 DEC 2017 5:42PM by PIB Delhi


    Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN) signed a framework Motor Vehicle Agreement (MVA) in June 2015 to enable movement of passenger and cargo vehicles across borders among the four countries.


    Bhutan, being one of the signatories to the BBIN MVA, has not yet ratified the Agreement for its entry into force. Pending ratification, however, Bhutan has given its consent for the BBIN MVA to enter into force amongst the other 3 countries i.e. Bangladesh, India and Nepal, who have already ratified it. India has, therefore, approached Bangladesh and Nepal through diplomatic channels for evolving modalities to operationalize the MVA among Bangladesh, India and Nepal (BIN).


    This information was given by Minister of State for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and C&F Shri Mansukh L Mandaviya in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today .
