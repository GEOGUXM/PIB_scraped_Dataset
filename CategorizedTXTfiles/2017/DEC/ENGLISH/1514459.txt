      Requests for Domestic Coal Linkages by State sector Power Projects, originally envisaged on Imported Coal, being considered under SHAKTI POLICY
      Posted On: 28 DEC 2017 2:39PM by PIB Delhi


    Minister of State (IC) for Power and New & Renewable Energy, Shri Raj Kumar Singh, in a written reply to a question on number of power plants dependent on imported coal in the country, in Lok Sabha today informed thatMinistry of Coal, in May 2017, has issued new coal linkage policy for Power Sector â€“ 2017 SHAKTI POLICY . Under Clause B(vii) of the policy, a provision has been made for allocating coal linkage through bidding process to Independent Power Producers (IPPs) having Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) based on imported coal, with full pass through of cost saving to consumers. Further, several State Sector projects which were envisaged on imported coal and now propose to use domestic coal have requested for accord of domestic coal linkage. These requests are considered under Clause B (i) of SHAKTI POLICY, the Minister added.


    Shri Singh informed that some power plants have been designed to operate on imported coal and hence, there are technical constraints in operating them on domestic coal. As per reports with the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), the details of coal based thermal power plants designed on imported coal are as given in the table below. In addition, some power plants use imported coal for blending with domestic coal, the Minister added.
