      Vaccination in CGHS Centres
      Posted On: 29 DEC 2017 4:18PM by PIB Delhi


    Under Universal Immunization Programme, vaccine against Rotavirus is currently provided in Government Hospitals, Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and CGHS dispensaries of nine states (Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Tripura). Vaccine against Chicken Pox is not a part of Universal Immunization Programme.


    Any decision to include vaccines for Chicken Pox in UIP is taken by National Technical Group on Immunization (NTAGI). Once NTAGI takes such as decision, this vaccine is provided in all government hospitals, CGHS dispensaries and PHCs.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
