     1. PORTS

    1.1 Ports play an important role in the trade of the country. In fact they are the gateways for EXIM Trade. Over all the ports in India handle 90% by volume and 70% by value of India’s external trade.


    Capacity and Traffic


    1.2 In order to meet the ever increasing trade requirements of the country, the focus has been on the infrastructure development and capacity enhancement of the Ports. Over the years the cargo handling capacity of the major ports has been growing steadily as under:

    1.4 During 2016-17, 57 Projects were awarded, involving an investment of Rs. 9490.51 crore and additional capacity of 103.52 MTPA was created. In 2017-18, 59 projects have been targeted for award of which 12 have already been awarded. With a view to promote Port led development, the Sagarmala Programme was approved by the Cabinet on 25-03-2015. This is a flagship initiative of Government of India. Under this programme 142 Port Projects involving an investment of around Rs. 91,434 crore for capacity enhancement have been identified for implementation during the next 10-15 years.


    Improvement in efficiency parameters


    1.5 While increasing the capacity of major ports, Ministry of Shipping has been striving to improve their operational efficiencies through policy and procedural changes and mechanization. As a result key efficiency parameters have improved considerably. The Average Turnaround Time has improved from 87.36 Hrs in 2015-16 to 82.56 Hrs in 2016-17 and significant improvement to 63.33 Hrs during the 2017-18 (as on 31.10.2017). The Average Output Per Ship Berthday has increased from 13156 Tonnes in 2015-16 to 14583Tonnes in 2016-17 and to 14912 Tonnes in 2017-18(as on 31.10.2017). A study to benchmark the performance of Major Ports to comparable international ports was taken up with a view to improve the operational efficiency and profitability. Out of the 116 initiatives recommended by the consultants, 86 have already been implemented and the remaining will be implemented by 2019. The implementation of these recommendations is expected to lead to further improvement in the operational efficiency and productivity of the Major Ports in the coming years.


    Policy initiatives to improve efficiency


    1.6 The achievement of the Major Ports in terms of capacity augmentation, improved operational efficiency and higher operating surplus has been made possible due to certain pro-active policy initiatives taken by the Ministry of Shipping. A new Berthing Policy and Stevedoring Policy have been implemented. The tariff guidelines were revised to provide flexibility to port operators to align the tariff closer to market tariff subject to achievement of certain performance standards. 100% FDI is being allowed in PPP Projects in the Port Sector. The Model Concession Agreement is being amended with a view to obviate the problems being faced in execution of PPP Projects on account of certain provisions of the present MCA, in order to make the investments in the Port Sector more attractive. A new Major Ports Authorities Bill, 2016 to replace the existing Major Port Trusts Act, 1963 with a view to provide greater autonomy and modernization of institutional structure has been introduced in the Lok Sabha on 16.12.2016. The Bill has been examined by the Parliamentary Standing Committee and based on the recommendations made in the Committee’s Report, necessary Official amendments in the proposed Bill have been formulated. Inter –Ministerial consultations are being held before seeking approval of the Union Cabinet for introduction of the Official amendments in the proposed Bill.

    Ease of Doing Business


    1.8 As part of promoting Ease of Doing Business to promote and facilitate business at ports, a number of activities which include elimination of manual forms, direct port delivery, installation of container scanners at ports, RFID based automation system etc have been undertaken. RFID system has already been put in place in 9 Major Ports and the system is expected to be in place in the remaining ports by March, 2018. Direct Port Delivery (DPD) volume is steadily growing. Further as part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Green agenda, new schemes have been formulated for providing financial assistance to Major Ports for green initiatives and also for building their capacity for combating oil pollution. The ports are being rated on cleanliness. Major Ports are taking up renewable energy projects to generate more than 150 MW (solar & wind energy) in the next five years. 15 MW Solar and 6 MW Wind Powers has already been commissioned in the Major Ports during 2016-17 and by the end of 2018, 91.5 MW Solar and 45 MW Wind Powers is expected to be achieved. Focus is being given on setting up of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and Coastal Economic Zones around major ports. SEZ at JNPT Smart Industrial Port Cities at Kandla and Paradip are under implementation.

The project would facilitate movement of construction material for Amravati, the upcoming capital city of Andhra Pradesh. The work for dredging and setting up of floating terminals has commenced.


    2.7 Movement of Cargo on NWs


    The IWAI is focussing its energy on movement of cargo on the National Waterways so that by the time the terminals and other infrastructure are established they are utilized effectively. A pilot run of defence cargo (eight Army trucks and 20 personnel) transportation on IWAI’s Ro-Ro vessel, MV Gopinath Bordoloi (capacity 250 DWT from Pandu (Guwahati) to Bogibil (Dibrugarh) on National Waterway-2 (river Brahmaputra) in Assam was conducted successfully during 24 th to 29 th April, 2017.

    IWAI’s cargo vessel MV V.V. Giri moved 240 metric tonnes of bagged cement of a prominent manufacturer from Lolaghat, West Bengal (Rupnarayan river) to Bhagalpur (on Ganga).


    Transportation of 50,610 ton of cement from Gaighat (Patna) to Bhagalpur and 73,400 ton km stone chips from Sahibganj (Jharkhand) to Manihari (Bihar) on NW-1 was completed during April, 2017 by a bare boat charter agency.


    2.8 Development of eight (08) new NWs


    Mandovi, Zuari, Camberjua, Barak, Gandak, Rupnarayan, Alappuzha-Kottayam-Athirampuzha Canal and Sunderbans National Waterways were considered for development during 2017-18.

To implement the decision, the Central Road Fund (Amendment) Bill, 2017 has been introduced in Lok Sabha on 24.07.2017.


    The decision of the Cabinet is a major boost for development of IWT sector which was not able to take off in the past due to low public funding. An allocation of 2.5 per cent of CRF proceeds would provide approximately Rs. 2000 crore per annum for the development and maintenance of NWs at existing rates of duties funding the CRF. The Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has estimated that approximately Rs. 25,000 crore would be required for development of identified projects on NWs till 2022-23.


    2.11 Freight Village and Logistics Hub at Varanasi


    To improve logistics efficiency, it is proposed to set up a Freight Village and Logistics Hub in Varanasi in continuation of the multi-modal terminal under construction as part of the Jal Marg Vikas Project.

This was against the mantra of ‘ease of doing business’ and were also contrary to the stated objective of the Government of India for increasing the share of Indian seafarers in global shipping industry.
