    Minister of State (IC) for Power and New & Renewable Energy, Shri Raj Kumar Singh, in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today, informed that as on 1st April, 2015, there were 18,452 un-electrified villages in the country and as on 30th November, 2017, 15,183 villages have been electrified and 1052 villages have been found un-inhabited. All un-electrified villages are targeted for electrification by 1st May, 2018.


    Shri Singh informed that as reported by the States/UTs, 14,528 villages have been electrified during the last three years i.e. 2014-15 to 2016-17. Further, a subsidy of Rs. 15,840 crores has been released under Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) across the country during the last three years i.e. 2014-15 to 2016-17.

    Electricity is a concurrent subject and distribution of electricity to consumers including poor villagers is primarily the responsibility of the respective State Government/ Distribution utility. In several States, such as Rajasthan, Punjab, Odisha, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh supply to BPL (Below Poverty Line) consumers is at comparatively lower tariff, the Minister stated.
