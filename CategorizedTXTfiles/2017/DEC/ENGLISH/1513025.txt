    As and when the applications for grant of permission to import/ manufacture and marketing of any new drug including anticancer drugsare received by Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), the applications are evaluated in consultation with the Subject Expert Committees (SECs) and permission is granted in accordance with the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 and the applicable guidelines based on the recommendation of the Committee. There are provisions under the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, under which permission to import/manufacture for marketing of new drugs can be granted without local clinical trial under certain conditions to make such drugs available early in the country in public interest.


    The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) under the Department of Pharmaceuticals has fixed the ceiling price of 849 essential medicines to make them affordable. Further, affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment (AMRIT) Deendayal Pharmacies are being opened by M/s HLL Lifecare Ltd., a PSU under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, with an objective to make available drugs and implants at discounted prices to the patientssuffering from Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases.
