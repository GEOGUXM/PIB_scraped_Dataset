    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the 14 th convocation of the Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology in Allahabad today (December 15, 2017).


    Speaking on the occasion, the President expressed happiness at the fact that since 2007 the Institute has the status of an “Institute of National Importance”. He noted that talented students from this institution are contributing impressively across the country and abroad. MNNIT, he said, should now set itself the goal of figuring in global rankings of best technology institutions.


    The President added that education is the foundation of our country. True education, apart from providing technical skills, makes us aware of our responsibilities towards society by building an ethical character. And this is the real contribution of education to the nation.


    The President said that if students use their talent and knowledge in everyday life, they will be able to advance their prospects in a balanced and rounded manner and also contribute to society. He counselled that MNNIT should help find comprehensive solutions to problems related to its surroundings. For instance, its students could contribute to the Namami Gange campaign by making technical suggestions. He was also happy to note that MNNIT has set up an Entrepreneurship Cell, the aim of which is to produce job creators.
