        States/UTs also set their own plantation targets, in addition to the plantation targets fixed under TPP by MoEF&CC. As stated by GNCT of Delhi, as per the policy of the Delhi Govt., the forest department allots a target of 1.00 million saplings approximately to Greening Agencies each year to make Delhi green which includes the targets given by MoEF&CC under TPP. As stated by GNCT of Delhi, 28.11 lakhs saplings including the target fixed by MoEF&CC and Delhi Govt. has been achieved during last three years.


        As per the reports, the plantation targets fixed by MoEF&CC, have been achieved fully. However, as stated by Delhi Government, some greening agencies like Airport Authority of India, BSES, Delhi Cantonment Board, PWD have either not reported the achievement of plantation targets allotted to them which is over and above the targets fixed by MoEF&CC or reported less achievements. Such lesser achievement of targets is given to the concerned greening agency as backlog to be completed in the next year.


        The National Forest Policy, 1988 envisages a target of 33% of Forest and Tree Cover (FTC) of the total geographical area of the country for ensuring environmental stability. The Forest Survey of India (FSI), Dehradun assesses the FTC of the country at the interval of two years. The total green cover (FTC) of Delhi, as per ISFR, 2015, is 20.22% to state’s geographical area, which has shown a net increase of about 1.96 sq. km. as compared to the previous assessment of ISFR, 2013. Moreover, despite severe pressure on land resources for developmental activities to cater to the needs of ever increasing population of Delhi, being the national capital of India the total green cover of Delhi has increased from 5.93% in the year 1999 to 20.22% to the total geographical area of NCT Delhi in 2015.”
