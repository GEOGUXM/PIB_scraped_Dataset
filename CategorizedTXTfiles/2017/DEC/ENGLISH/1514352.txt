      Posted On: 27 DEC 2017 5:24PM by PIB Delhi


    In the Union Budget for FY 2017-18, Gross and net market borrowing were budgeted at Rs. 5,80,000 crore and Rs. 4,23,226 crore respectively with Rs. 3,48,226 crore being raised (net) from dated Government securities and Rs. 2,002 crore from T-bills. Borrowings in FY 18 till date (Dec. 26, 2017) have been conducted in line with the borrowing calendar for FY18. Gross and net market borrowings in FY 18 till December 26, 2017 are Rs. 5,21,000 crore and Rs. 3,81,281 crore, excluding buyback/switches, respectively. As against the budgeted net T-bills receipt of Rs. 2002 crore in FY 18, net collections till Dec 26 2017 are Rs. 86,203 crore.


    The borrowing programme of the Government of India has been reviewed, with RBI, and following decisions taken:

     1. The Government will trim down the T-Bills from present collections of Rs. 86,203 Crore to Rs. 25,006 Crore by March end, 2018.
     2. The Government will raise additional market borrowings of Rs. 50,000 crore only in fiscal FY18 through dated Government securities.
     3. The Government will thus, between now and March 2018, not be raising any net additional borrowing (T-Bills will be run down by Rs. 61,203 crore and additional G-Sec borrowing will be Rs. 50,000 crore).

    Revised G-sec and T-Bill calendar for Q4 FY18 are being notified. The revised G-Sec borrowing would be Rs. 15,000 crore each last five weekly auctions of FY 18 ending on 9 th February, 2018.
