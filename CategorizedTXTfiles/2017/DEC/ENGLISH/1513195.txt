      Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


      Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:


      1.1 Crude oil production by ONGC during November, 2017 was 1795.29 TMT which is 5.95% lower than the monthly target and 1.54% lower when compared with November, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-November, 2017 was 14986.62 TMT which is 2.31% lower than target for the period but 1.78% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production with respect to target are as under:


      v Natural decline/increase in water cut in wells of matured fields of Western Offshore.


      v Additional production planned from WO-16 cluster from Oct’17 could not be realised due to delay in conversion of Sagar Samrat to MoPU .


      v Production planned from project “Integrated Development of B 127 Cluster” could not be realized due to delay in implementation of project.


      v Production from B-193 cluster in western offshore restricted due to high back pressure in B-193 export pipeline due to choking . Solvent jobs being carried out at regular intervals to reduce back pressure.


      v Production from NBP field in western offshore affected due to ESP related issues . Rigs deployed at NBP-C & NBP-A well platforms for remedial jobs.


      v Repair of sub-sea leakage in 18 inch HSA-HRG well fluid line .


      v Frequent power shut downs in Mehsana, Ahmedabad & Assam hampered artificial lift operations.


      v Unexpected ceasure of more flowing wells in Mehsana & Assam Asset.


      v Wells closed for cluster drilling/ rig movements in Assam and Ahmedabad.


      1.2 Crude oil production by OIL during November, 2017 was 279.54 TMT which is 8.90% lower than monthly target but 3.74% higher than production in November, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-November, 2017 was 2260.04 TMT which is 9.45% lower than target for the period but 5.12% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      v Less than planned contribution from old wells – Rise in water cut in wells and decline in total liquid production of wells of Greater Hapjan and Greater Chandmari Fields.


      v Less than planned contribution from work over wells.


      1.3 Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during November, 2017 was 805.85 TMT which is 7.78% lower than the monthly target and 2.92% higher than November, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-November, 2017 was 6696.68 TMT which is 5.76% lower than target for the period and 5.89% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      v RJ-ON-90/1 (CIL): Around 120 wells are closed either due to high water cut or require WOJ. Underperformance of reservoir in Bhagyam. Production stopped from Guda, Kaameshwari West, Raageshwari and Saraswati due to non-availability of tanker since July’17. Mangla production hampered due to power fluid pump tripping during Nov’17.


      v CY-ONN-2002/2 (ONGC): Test production from 5 oil wells. PML not yet granted.


      Natural Gas


      2. Natural gas production during November, 2017 was 2714.87 MMSCM which is 6.08% lower than the target for the month but 1.68% higher when compared with November, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production during April-November, 2017 was 21936.19 MMSCM which is 5.25% lower than target for the period but 3.72% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II . Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of November, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April-November, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      v RJ-ON-90/1 (CIL): Around 120 wells are closed either due to high water cut or require WOJ. Underperformance of reservoir in Bhagyam.


      v Production stopped from Guda, Kaameshwari West, Raageshwari and Saraswati due to non-availability of tanker since July’17. Mangla production hampered due to power fluid pump tripping during Nov’17.


      2.2 Natural gas production by OIL during November, 2017 was 235.50 MMSCM which is 6.33% lower than the monthly target and 3.85% lower than November, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-November, 2017 was 1960.01 MMSCM which is 2.36% lower than the cumulative target and 0.26% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Mainly r eduction in production due to potential of few gas wells in Kathalguri and Zaloni area.


      2.3 Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during November, 2017 was 521.80 MMSCM which is 19.94% lower than the monthly target and 6.49% lower when compared with November, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-November, 2017 was 4325.80 MMSCM which is 18.21% lower than the cumulative target and 7.77% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      v KG- OSN-2001/3 (GSPC): Underperformance of wells.


      v Sohagpur West (RIL): Underperformance of CBM wells.


      v Raniganj East (Essar): Few wells closed for planned maintenance and refrac jobs. Less offtake by buyer.


      v Sohagpur West (RIL): Underperformance of CBM wells.


      v KG-DWN-98/3 (RIL): Closure of 2 wells in D1D3 field and 1 well in MA Field in KG-DWN-98/3. Planned compressor maintenance job at FPSO during 21 st to 28 th Oct.’17. Power failure occurred at onshore terminal on 3 rd Nov'17 which resulted in flaring of D1D3 gas.


      3. Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)


      Refinery production during November, 2017 was 21225.79 TMT which is 3.55% higher than the target for the month and 6.57% higher when compared with November, 2016. Cumulative production during April-November, 2017 was 165830.63 TMT which is 3.39% higher than the target for the period and 2.08% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III . Company-wise production for the month of November, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April-November, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

      Table 3: Refinery Production (TMT)


      3.1 CPSE Refineries’ production during November, 2017 was 12477.51 TMT which is only 8.25% higher than the target for the month and 8.99% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-November, 2017 was 95265.80 TMT which is 4.96% higher than the target for the period and 5.08% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


      Ø Visakh: Throughput lower than monthly target owing to CDU-I deferred shutdown taken in Nov’17 vis-à-vis July-Aug’17 planned.


      Ø Manali: Throughput lower than monthly target due to FO containment.


      Ø CPCL CBR: Throughput lower due to product upliftment constraints .


      3.2 Production in JV refineries during November, 2017 was 1216.53 TMT which is 15.40% lower than the target for the month and 31.48% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-November, 2017 was 9313.32 TMT which is 1.13% lower than the target for the period and 16.30% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. BORL’s refinery production was lower due to deferred planned turnaround during Nov’17 as against originally scheduled in Sep'17.


      3.3 Production in private refineries during November, 2017 was 7531.75 TMT which is 0.02% lower than the target for the month and 0.16% lower when compared with November, 2016. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-November, 2017 was 61251.52 TMT which is 1.74% higher than the target for the period and 0.97% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year.


      3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of November, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April-November, 2017 vis-à-vis April-November, 2016 are given at Annexures - IV and V respectively.
