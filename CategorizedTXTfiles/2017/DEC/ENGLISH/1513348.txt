      Posted On: 20 DEC 2017 4:18PM by PIB Delhi


    There has been a delay in the production and deployment of aircraft Tejas. Two contracts were signed between Indian Air Force (IAF) & Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for procurement of (i) 20 Initial Operational Clearance (IOC) standard aircraft on 31 st March 2006 to be completed by December 2011 and (ii) 20 Final Operational Clearance (FOC) standard aircraft on 23 rd December 2010 to be completed by December 2016.


    Out of total 20 IOC aircraft (16 fighters and 4 trainers), 5 fighters have been delivered by HAL to IAF till date. The production of remaining 15 IOC aircraft (11 fighter + 4 trainer) are taken up at HAL.


    Production for 20 FOC aircraft, will be taken up after FOC clearance by Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA).


    In order to fast track the production of LCA Tejas, the following initiatives have been taken:-
