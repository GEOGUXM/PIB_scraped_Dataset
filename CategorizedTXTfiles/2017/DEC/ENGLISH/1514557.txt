        · Reasons for low growth in production of coal by CIL:


        The reason for the shortfall in achievement of the production target set for the year 2017-18:


        a) EC & FC problems in some mines


        b) Land acquisition and R&R problem


        c) Excessive rainfall in August and September


        d) Law and order problem mainly in CCL & MCL


        e) Evacuation problem


        f) Accumulation of high stock due to less lifting of coal by consumers upto July 2017

        Power Sector Linkage Policy – SHAKTI


        · New More Transparent Coal Allocation Policy for Power Sector, 2017- SHAKTI has been issued on 22.05.2017.


        · Clearance has been given to CIL to sign Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA) with 4 Letter of Assurance (LoA) holders having total commissioned capacity of 3570 MW. Coal supply to 19,000 MW (out of 68,000 MW) which could not be commissioned by 31.03.2015 has started for commissioned plants.


        · Ministry of Coal has approved linkages for 6 Central PSUs and 4 State PSUs on the recommendations of Ministry of Power.


        · Linkage auction for Independent Power Producers (IPPs) having Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) based on domestic coal conducted from 11 th to 13 th September 2017. Maximum Allocable Quantity was 27.18 MT. Almost all the allocable quantity of 27.18 MT was booked with only 402 tons remaining un-booked.


        · Auction process of Linkages for IPPs without PPA has been initiated.


        · CIL has requested from CEA for the probable list of participants along with capacity.


        · Online public notification for interested bidders has been issued by CIL on 06.10.2017.


        Auction of Linkages to Non-regulated Sector.


        · Policy for auction of Linkages to Non-regulated Sector was issued on 15.02.2016. All allocations of Linkages/LoAs for non-regulated sector viz. Cement, Steel/Sponge Iron, Aluminium and others (excluding Fertilizer (urea) sector), including their Captive Power Producers (CPPs), shall be auction based.


        · Tenure of new Fuel Supply Agreements (FSAs) subject to a maximum of 15 years.


        · In tranche I, II & III a total of 40.24 MT was booked. The percentage gain over notified price of non-power is 8.58%. Total numbers of successful bidders were 719.


        Third Party Sampling:


        · In order to address the concerns of coal consumers regarding the grade slippages and other quality issues, a third party sampling procedure has been put in place wherein a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed by the coal company, the coal consumer and CIMFR for sampling and testing of coal at the loading end.


        · Against Tripartite Agreement of about 513 Million Tons signed by CIMFR with Power Sector, sampling has been commenced for about 492 Million tons (96% of the total agreement signed).


        · Further, against Tripartite Agreement signed for 20 Million Tons for Special Forward and Linkage Auction schemes, sampling has been commenced for a quantity of about 14 million tons by QCI (70% of the total agreement signed).


        · The sampling and testing charges are borne equally by the buyer and the seller. The states/gencos are using this platform of 3 rd party sampling for quality assurance.


        Rationalization of Linkages:


        · Inter-Ministerial Task Force was constituted in June, 2014 for review of existing coal sources as also feasibility for rationalization of these sources with a view to optimize transportation cost.


        · Coal Linkage rationalization in Power sector has resulted in decrease in transportation cost of coal from the mines to the power plants leading to more efficient coal based generation of Power.


        · Total coal movement rationalization of 54.76 MT has taken place with annual potential savings of Rs.3354 Crore.


        BHARAT 22 ETF


        · Consequent upon the CCEA’s authorisation, the Alternative Mechanism approved the composition of new exchange traded fund namely Bharat 22 ETF with 22 constituent entities including CIL and NLCIL.
