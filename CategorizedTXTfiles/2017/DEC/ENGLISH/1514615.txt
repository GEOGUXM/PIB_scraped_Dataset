      Posted On: 29 DEC 2017 4:04PM by PIB Delhi


    National level data on the prevalence of gestational diabetes in women is not available. However, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has informed that as per studies conducted in rural areas of Jammu, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Haryana, the range of prevalence of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) varies from 6.7% to 13.9%.


    To improve the detection of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in pregnant women, Government of India has released the Guidelines on Diagnosis and Management of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in pregnant women in November 2014. As per the guidelines, GDM testing has been included in the essential ante natal care package for all pregnant women.


    As per the guidelines, a 3 day training is organized at the district level, for the Staff Nurses, Auxiliary Nurse Midwives, Medical officers and Obstetrician & Gynaecologist (SNs/ANMs/MOs/ObGyn) and the training is done for all public health facilities in the district from the Medical College level to the sub-centre level.


    Information Education and Communication (IEC) module is included in the training of health workers for imparting counselling to pregnant women which includes importance of healthy lifestyle including diet in preventing diabetes and Do’s and Don’ts for management of GDM.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
