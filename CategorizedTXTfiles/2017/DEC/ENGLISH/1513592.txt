      NGT in its final judgment order in O.A. No. 200/2014 in the matter of M.C.

      The Government has intensified its efforts for pollution abatement of river Ganga. Cleaning of river Ganga is being carried out through various activities including treatment of municipal sewage, treatment of industrial effluent, river surface cleaning, rural sanitation, afforestation & bio-diversity etc. The municipal sewage being generated in cities on banks of Ganga is being managed by a mix of Interception & Diversion projects, sewerage network and Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) projects. Over 3000 Million Litres Per Day (MLD) of sewage is generated by the towns situated on the main stem of river Ganga. Against this, sewage treatment capacity available is 1580 MLD. National Mission for Clean Ganga has sanctioned projects for creation of additional 1570 MLD capacity and these projects are at various stages of implementation.
