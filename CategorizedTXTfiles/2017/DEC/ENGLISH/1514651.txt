Before this, t he vocational training to girls of age 16 years and above was provided under the scheme. The details of the number of girls benefitted therefrom State wise during 2016-17 is given below:

TOTAL     204631                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                

      To enhance the coverage and improve the functioning of the said scheme, the Government is reviewing the performance of the Scheme at regular intervals on a quarterly/annual basis to identify gaps for taking corrective measures. Monitoring committees are set up at all levels (National, State, District, Block and Village level) to take stock of the progress of the scheme as also strengthen the coordination and convergence between concerned departments.
