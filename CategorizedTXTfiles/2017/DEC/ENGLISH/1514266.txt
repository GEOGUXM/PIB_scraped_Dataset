    Government regularly reviews the threat perception to secure our borders and protect national interests. Our armed forces are geared up to safeguard our borders and uphold the sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of India.


    Defence technology of any nation spawns a wide spectrum of technologies. While some technologies may be ‘state of the art’, some other may not be so. It is always an endeavour to optimise this ‘mix’, keeping our threat perceptions in mind. As technologies evolve, defence equipment are upgraded / replaced and this is a continuous process.


    The ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Government has recognised Defence Sector as one of the priority sectors. It is an initiative that aims to achieve self-reliance for the country in defence manufacturing and equipping the forces with the best possible equipment. The Government is pursuing several initiatives under ‘Make in India’ to achieve higher levels of indigenization and self-reliance in the defence sector.


    This information was given by Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri Balabhadra Majhi in Lok Sabha today.
