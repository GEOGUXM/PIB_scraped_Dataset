      Setting up of Universities
      Posted On: 18 DEC 2017 6:41PM by PIB Delhi


    Education being in the concurrent list, creation of new institutions is the responsibility of both Central Government and the State Governments. Further, t he Central Government has taken a policy decision not to convert State Universities into Central Universities for reasons of legacy issues, adjustment of existing staff and disaffiliation of affiliated colleges.


    At present, no proposal to accord the status of Central University to any State University is under consideration of the Government. However, the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014 provides for establishment of one Central University in the successor State of Andhra Pradesh and one Tribal University each in the State of Andhra Pradesh and in the State of Telangana.


    Further, the Government has approved the scheme of providing Regulatory Architecture for setting up/upgrading of 20 Institutions (10 from Public Sector and 10 from Private Sector) as world class teaching and research institutions known as “Institutions of Eminence”. The Regulatory Architecture has been provided in the form of UGC (Declaration of Government Institutions as Institutions of Eminence) Guidelines, 2017 for public Institutions and UGC (Institutions of Eminence Deemed to be Universities ) Regulations, 2017 for private Institutions.


    Also under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA), central assistance is provided to States/UTs, inter alia , for setting up of State universities either by the way of clustering of colleges or by upgradation of existing autonomous colleges. The State/UT-wise details of number of universities approved for creation under RUSA are as under:
