      The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has taken several steps to fructify Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s dream of a clean energy future for the ‘New India’. The largest renewable capacity expansion programme in the world is being taken up by India. The government is aiming to increase share of clean energy through massive thrust in renewables. Core drivers for development and deployment of new and renewable energy in India have been Energy security, Electricity shortages, Energy Access, Climate change etc.


      A capacity addition of 27.07 GW of renewable energy has been reported during the last three and half years under Grid Connected Renewable Power, which include 12.87 GW from Solar Power, 11.70 GW from Wind Power, 0.59 from Small Hydro Power and 0.79 from Bio-power. Confident by the growth rate in clean energy sector, the Government of India in its submission to the United Nations Frame Work Convention on Climate Change on Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) has stated that India will achieve 40% cumulative Electric power capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030 with the help of transfer of technology and low cost International Finance including from Green Climate Fund. As on 30.11.2017, Solar Energy Projects with an aggregate capacity of over 16611.73 MW including 863.92 MW from Solar Roof Top projects has been installed in the country.


      The government is playing an active role in promoting the adoption of renewable energy resources by offering various incentives, such as generation-based incentives (GBIs), capital and interest subsidies, viability gap funding, concessional finance, fiscal incentives etc. The National Solar Mission aims to promote the development and use of solar energy for power generation and other uses, with the ultimate objective of making solar energy compete with fossil-based energy options. The objective of the National Solar Mission is to reduce the cost of solar power generation in the country through long-term policy, large scale deployment goals, aggressive R&D and the domestic production of critical raw materials, components and products. Renewable energy is becoming increasingly cost-competitive as compared to fossil fuel-based generation.


      In order to achieve the renewable energy target of 175 GW by the year 2022, the major programmes/ schemes on implementation of Solar Park, Solar Roof Top Scheme, Solar Defence Scheme, Solar scheme for CPUs Solar PV power plants on Canal Bank and Canal Tops, Solar Pump, Solar Rooftop etc have been launched during the last two years.


      Various policy measures have been initiated and special steps taken in addition to providing financial support to various schemes being implemented by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) for achieving the target of renewable energy capacity to 175 GW by the year 2022. These include, inter alia, suitable amendments to the Electricity Act and Tariff Policy for strong enforcement of Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) and for providing Renewable Generation Obligation (RGO); setting up of exclusive solar parks; development of power transmission network through Green Energy Corridor project; guidelines for procurement of solar and wind power though tariff based competitive bidding process, National Offshore Wind Energy Policy notified, Repowering of Wind Power Projects, Standards for Deployment of Solar Photovoltaic systems/ devices, orders for waiving the Inter State Transmission System charges and losses for interstate sale of solar and wind power for projects to be commissioned by March 2019; identification of large government complexes/ buildings for rooftop projects; provision of roof top solar and 10 percent renewable energy as mandatory under Mission Statement and Guidelines for development of smart cities; amendments in building bye-laws for mandatory provision of roof top solar for new construction or higher Floor Area Ratio; infrastructure status for solar projects; raising tax free solar bonds; providing long tenor loans; making roof top solar as a part of housing loan by banks/ NHB; incorporating measures in Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) for encouraging distribution companies and making net-metering compulsory and raising funds from bilateral and international donors as also the Green Climate Fund to achieve the target.


      Other important initiatives and achievements of MNRE are:


      ESTIMATED POTENTIAL OF RENEWABLE ENERGY


      The increased use of indigenous renewable resources is expected to reduce India’s dependence on expensive imported fossil fuels. India has an estimated renewable energy potential of about 1096 GW from commercially exploitable sources viz. Wind – 302 GW (at 100-meter mast height); Small Hydro – 21 GW; Bio-energy – 25 GW; and 750 GW solar power, assuming 3% wasteland


      TARGETS


      The Government of India has set a target of 175 GW renewable power installed capacity by the end of 2022. This includes 60 GW from wind power, 100 GW from solar power, 10 GW from biomass power and 5 GW from small hydro power.


      A target of 14550 MW grid renewable power (wind 4000 MW, solar 10000 MW, small hydro power 200 MW, bio-power 340 MW and waste to power 10 MW), has been set for 2017-18. Besides, under off-grid renewable system, targets of 15 MW eq. waste to energy, 60 MW eq. biomass non-bagasse cogeneration, 7.50 MW eq. biomass gasifiers, 0.5 MW eq. small wind/hybrid systems, 100 MW eq. solar photovoltaic systems, 150/25 Nos. eq. micro hydel and 110,000 nos. family size biogas plants have been set for 2017-18.


      SHARE OF RENEWABLE POWER IN TOTAL INSTALLED CAPACITY


      Economic growth, increasing prosperity, a growing rate of urbanization and rising per capita energy consumption has increases the energy demand of the country. In order to meet the energy demand, India has total installed power generation capacity of 331.95 GW as on 31.10.2017 from all resources. With 60.98 GW installed renewable power capacity, the renewable power has a share of about 18.37% to the total installed capacity.

      Major Initiatives taken by Ministry


      Solar Power


      · Under National Solar Mission, the target for setting up solar capacity increased from
      20 GW to 100 GW by 2021-22. Target of 10,000 MW, set for 2017-18 which will take the cumulative capacity over 20GW till 31st March 2018.


      · As on date, 23656 MW has been tendered out, of which LOI issued for
      19340 MW.


      · Capacity of the scheme for “Development of Solar Parks and Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects” has been enhanced from 20,000 MW to 40, 000 MW. 35 solar parks of aggregate capacity 20,514 MW have been approved in 21 States.


      · Kurnool Solar Park in Andhra Pradesh with 1000 MW capacity has already been commissioned and is operational. With commissioning of 1000 MW capacity at single location, Kurnool Solar Park has emerged as the World’s Largest Solar Park.


      · 650 MW capacity commissioned in Bhadla Phase-II Solar Park in Rajasthan.


      · 250 MW capacity commissioned in Phase –I of Neemuch Mandsaur Solar Park (500 MW) in Madhya Pradesh.


      · 3 new solar parks have been approved in this year at Rajasthan (1000 MW), Gujarat (500 MW) and Mizoram (23 MW) after issue of Guidelines for Enhancement of capacity from 20, 000 MW to 40, 000 MW under Solar Park Scheme.
