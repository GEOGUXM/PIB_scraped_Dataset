The index for ‘Manufacture of Textiles’ group rose by 0.3 percent to 113.5 (provisional) from 113.2 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of weaving & finishing of textiles (2%) and synthetic yarn, luore yarn, luorescen & twisted yarn and viscose yarn (1% each). However, the price of cotton yarn and manufacture of cordage, rope, twine & netting (2% each), and manufacture of knitted & crocheted fabrics (1%) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Wood and of Products of Wood & Cork ‘ group declined by 0.5 percent to 131.6 (provisional) from 132.3 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of plywood block boards (2%) and lamination wooden sheets/veneer sheets (1%). However, the price of timber/wooden plank, sawn/resawn (3%) and wood cutting, processed/sized and particle boards (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Paper and Paper Products’ group declined by 1.3 percent to 118.1 (provisional) from 119.6 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of corrugated sheet box (7%), tissue paper (5%), paper carton/box (4%), laminated plastic sheet (2%) and paper for printing & writing (1%). However, the price of paper bag including craft paper bag (5%), duplex paper (4%) and corrugated paper board and hard board (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Pharmaceuticals, Medicinal Chemical and Botanical Products’ group declined by 0.4 percent to 121.6 (provisional) from 122.1 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of antidiabetic drug excluding insulin (i.e. tolbutam) (14%) and simvastatin (1%). However, the price of anti inflammatory preparation (8%), cotton wool (medicinal) (5%), vaccine for hepatitis-B (4%), plastic capsules and vials/ampoule, glass, empty or filled (2% each) and antipyretic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory formulations, ayurvedic medicaments and antioxidants (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Other Non-Metallic Mineral Products’ group declined by 0.4 percent to 111.4 (provisional) from 111.8 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of plain bricks (4%), non ceramic tiles (3%), clinker (2%) and cement blocks (concrete), asbestos corrugated sheet, electric insulating material, ceramic tiles (vitrified tiles), slag cement, marble slab and glass bottle (1% each). However, the price of porcelain sanitary ware, granite, stone, chip, porcelain crockery and white cement (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Basic Metals’ group rose by 0.3 percent to 101.0 (provisional) from 100.7 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of alloy steel castings (10%), aluminium alloys (4%), copper shapes- bars/rods/plates/strips, steel forgings – rough, rails, copper metal/copper rings, stainless steel tubes, aluminium shapes – bars/rods/flats and ms bright bars (2% each) and aluminium disk and circles, luoresc foil, stainless steel coils, strips & sheets, cold rolled (CR) coils & sheets, including narrow strip, ferrochrome, aluminium powder, lead ingots, bars, blocks, plates, aluminium metal, MS pencil ingots, angles, channels, sections, steel (coated/not) and stainless steel bars & rods, including flats (1% each). However, the price of other ferro alloys and MS castings (2% each) and aluminium ingot, gp/gc sheet, cast iron, castings, ferromanganese and galvanized iron pipes (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Fabricated Metal Products, Except Machinery and Equipment’ group rose by 2.1 percent to 111.1 (provisional) from 108.8 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of cylinders (6%), stainless steel razor (5%), stainless steel utensils and hand tools (4% each), lock/padlock (3%), stainless steel tank, steel container, pressure cooker and copper bolts, screws, nuts (2% each) and steel drums and barrels, forged steel rings, electrical stamping- laminated or otherwise and bolts, screws, nuts & nails of iron & steel (1% each). However, the price of metal cutting tools & accessories (5%) and steel structures (1%) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Computer, Electronic and Optical Products’ group declined by 1.3 percent to 110.3 (provisional) from 111.8 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of colour TV (4%), meter (non-electrical) (2%) and capacitors, scientific time keeping device, watch and air conditioner (1% each). However, the price of sunglasses (2%) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Electrical Equipment’ group declined by 0.2 percent to 110.0 (provisional) from 110.2 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of fibre optic cables (6%), electric welding machine (4%), connector/plug/socket/holder-electric (3%), insulator, amplifier and incandescent lamps (2% each) and pvc insulated cable, aluminium wire, insulating & flexible wire, generators & alternators, electric switch gear control/starter and dry cells such as torch light batteries (1% each). However, the price of motors & other dc equipment (15%), copper wire (6%), ACSR conductors (4%), electric wires & cables (3%), electric & other meters and jelly filled cables (2% each) and batteries, solenoid valve, electrical relay/conductor, electrical resistors (except heating resistors), rubber insulated cables, rotor/magneto rotor assembly, luorescent tube and washing machines/laundry machines (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Machinery and Equipment’ group rose by 0.3 percent to 109.4 (provisional) from 109.1 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of pressure vessel and tank for fermentation & other food processing and hydraulic equipment (5% each), excavator and rice mill machinery (3% each), roller and ball bearings, gasket kit, manufacture of bearings, gears, gearing & driving elements and chemical equipment & system (2% each) and air filters, pharmaceutical machinery, sugar machinery, air or vacuum pump, threshers and air gas compressor including compressor for refrigerator (1% each). However, the price of dumper (8%), conveyors – non-roller type and precision machinery equipment/form tools (5% each), drilling machine (4%), grinding or polishing machine and chillers (2% each) and motor starter, industrial valve, oil pump, lathes, hydraulic pump and sewing machines (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Motor Vehicles, Trailers and Semi-Trailers’ group declined by 0.2 percent to 110.4 (provisional) from 110.6 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of passenger vehicles, radiators & coolers and minibus/bus (1% each). However, the price of body (for commercial motor vehicles) (5%) and chain, crankshaft, engine and shafts of all kinds (1% each) moved up.
