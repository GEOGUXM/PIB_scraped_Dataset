      Regulatory provisions for Spurious Ayurvedic and Unani medicines are prescribed in the Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940. The penalty provisions are also defined in Section 33-I of the Act for the defaulter to be punished with imprisonment for a term up to three years determined by the court and certain monetary fine. The responsibility to enforce these provisions is vested with the concerned State Governments.


      Government has implemented a Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National AYUSH Mission through which grant-in-aid from Rs 1.00 lakh to Rs 2.00 lakh per dispensary/hospital per annum is provided for supply of essential AYUSH medicines to the States on approval of the State Annual Action Plans. States are required to procure these medicines in accordance with the Essential Drugs Lists published by the Central Government and at least 50% of the grant funds have to be utilized for procurement of medicines from Central or State Public Sector Undertakings/Cooperative pharmacies. .
