      Posted On: 19 DEC 2017 3:17PM by PIB Delhi


    Health being a State subject, the responsibility for filling up of vacant posts in Government medical colleges is under the jurisdiction of respective State Governments. The data pertaining to vacant posts of Professor, Nurses and Technicians etc. in medical colleges of State Governments is not maintained centrally.


    However, the information regarding vacant posts in Central Government Institutions is at Annexure. To increase the availability of faculty in medical colleges in the country, Central Government has taken several steps. These include:


    i) The ratio of teachers to students has been revised from 1:1 to 1:2 for all MD/MS disciplines and 1:1 to 1:3 in subjects of Anaesthesiology, Forensic Medicine, Radiotherapy, Medical Oncology, Surgical Oncology and Psychiatry. Further, teacher: student ratio in public funded Government Medical Colleges for Professor has been increased from 1:2 to 1:3 in all clinical subjects and for Associate Professor from 1:1 to 1:2 if the Associate Professor is a unit head.


    ii) DNB qualification has been recognized for appointment as faculty to take care of shortage of faculty.


    iii) Enhancement of age limit for appointment/extension/re-employment against posts of teachers/dean/principal/ director in medical colleges from 65-70 years.


    iv) Removal of embargo/rider imposed on foreign qualified PG Doctors from five English speaking nations i.e. US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand in case of taking teaching profession. They are now allowed to take up the post of Assistant Professor in respective department.


    v) Assured Career Progression Scheme for faculty of Central Government Institutions has been revised to make it more beneficial.


    vi) Various allowances available to faculty like Non Practicing Allowance, Conveyance Allowance, Learning Resource Allowance, etc. have been enhanced considerably.


    vii) The Central Government is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for increase of PG seats in Government Medical Colleges.
