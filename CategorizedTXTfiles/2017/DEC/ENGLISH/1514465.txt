    Ganga Action Plan (GAP) was launched by Government of India for cleaning of river Ganga in 1985. Under GAP, 1098.31 MLD sewage treatment capacity was created. In 2015, Namami Gange Programme, an integrated Ganga conservation was launched by Govt. of India. Under Namami Gange Programme Government has sanctioned 93 sewage management projects at a cost of Rs. 14,167.94 Crore. These projects aims at creating 2205 MLD sewage treatment capacity apart from rehabilitating 564 MLD capacity sewage treatment plants (STP) and laying 4762 km of sewerage network. Of these 19 projects have been completed creating 155 MLD new capacity, rehabilitating 17 MLD existing capacity and 343 Km sewerage network. In addition, projects in Haryana (Panipat and Sonepat) have created 70 MLD new STP capacity and rehabilitation of 75 MLD existing STP capacity.


    Sewage generation estimated in 97 towns and cities along the main stem of river Ganga in the states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal is 2953 MLD. The existing installed capacity along the main stem of river Ganga in towns and cities of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal is 1580 MLD. 63 no. of projects for creation of 1582 MLD capacity of STPs have been sanctioned and are at various stages of implementation.


    84 STPs (1579 MLD) were constructed under various programmes (GAP, NGRBA and state projects) along river Ganga main stem. It has been reported that many of the existing STPs are either non-functional or underutilized and many of them do not meet standard norms prescribed by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) has taken initiative to make these STPs functional and operate them to their optimum capacity. NMCG has accordingly sanctioned up-gradation/rehabilitation for 23 such STPs. For other 57 STPs, consultant has been engaged to study these STPs and develop Detailed Progress Reports (DPRs) to make them functional as per design standards.


    This information was given by Union Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Dr. Satya Pal Singh in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
