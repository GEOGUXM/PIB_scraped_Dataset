      True to the motto of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) of “Empowering Business, Protecting Investors” and its function as Regulator, Integrator, Facilitator and Educator, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs was actively and affirmatively engaged in improving both the quantity and quality of implementation of laws related to Corporate Governance besides conducting Workshops on core related issues in the year 2017. The Ministry has given a major thrust to check the menace of black money by striking-off about 2.10 lakh shell companies from the Register of Companies and disqualifying more than 2 lakh Directors of such companies from holding any such position on the Board of Directors of any such company or any other Company for that matter.


      The Minister of State for Corporate Affairs, Shri P.P. Chaudhary has been leading from the front in the fight against the black money and any attempt of converting it into white through shell companies. In a Review Meeting held under his Chairmanship on the follow-up action by the States on properties belonging to around 2.09 lakh companies struck-off from the Register of Companies by the Central Government. The Minister sought the response from the representatives of the State Governments on the letter sent by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs on September 12, 2017 to the States for identification and tracking of properties. Till then, the figure of struck-off companies stood at around 2.25 lakh .


      In an another Review Meeting chaired by the Minister of State for Law, Justice and Corporate Affairs, Shri P.P. Chaudhary, it was decided that the Directors of all such shell companies which have not filed returns for three or more years, will be disqualified from being appointed in any other company as director or from being reappointed as director in any of the company where they had been directors, thereby compelling them to vacate office. It is expected that as a result of this exercise, at least two to three lakh directors on such companies will get disqualified.


      The Minister of State for Law, Justice and Corporate Affairs, Shri P.P. Chaudhary said it would help in checking the menace of black money and it would promote an ecosystem of “Ease of Doing Business” and enhancing investors’ confidence to which the present Government is fully committed. He said that the financial status of the companies would be reflected in a true and fair manner which would minimise the possibility of frauds and tax evasion. Further, the availability of funds for illegal purposes will also be checked. Shri Chaudhary concluded that the interest of stakeholders is fully protected and the image of the country in the global business arena and fora would substantially improve.


      Taking forward the initiative launched by the Government of India to curb the menace of shell companies, money laundering and black money in the country and prevent misuse of corporate structure by shell companies for various illegal purposes, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) have now concluded a formal Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for data exchange on 6 th September 2017.


      The MoU will facilitate the sharing of data and information between CBDT and MCA on an automatic and regular basis. It will enable sharing of specific information such as Permanent Account Number (PAN) data in respect of corporates, Income Tax returns (ITRs) of corporates, financial statements filed with the Registrar by corporates, returns of allotment of shares, audit reports and statements of financial transactions (SFT) received from banks relating to corporates.


      In a separate effort, the Minister of State for Law, Justice and Corporate Affairs, Shri P.P. Chaudhary also sought cooperation of private companies on CSR initiatives. He sought participation of the companies in ‘Swachhta Hi Seva’ campaign and contribute 7 % of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) spending to Swachh Bharat Kosh (SBK) during ‘Swachhta Hi Seva’ campaign. This campaign was held from 15 th September 2017 to 2 nd October 2017.


      The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) has seen hectic activity in the year 2017. To speed-up resolution of companies that are in trouble, IBBI in 2017 amended its Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process Regulations to ensure that as part of due diligence, prior to approval of a Resolution Plan, the antecedents, credit worthiness and credibility of a Resolution Applicant, including promoters, are taken into account by the Committee of Creditors.


      To improve the Regulatory Environment, IBBI notified the IBBI (Information Utilities) Regulations, 2017 on 31 st March, 2017. These Regulations provided that ordinarily a person should not hold more than 10% of paid-up equity share capital or voting power of an information utility, while allowing certain specified persons to hold up to 25%. These further provided that a person may hold up to 51% of paid-up equity share capital or total voting power of an information utility till the expiry of three years from its registration. IBBI has amended the IBBI (Information Utilities) Regulations, 2017 on 29th September, 2017.


      The IBBI notified the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Voluntary Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016. The Regulations provide the process from initiation of voluntary liquidation of a corporate person - companies, limited liability partnerships and any other persons incorporated with limited liability - till its dissolution. The Regulations came into effect from 1st April, 2017.


      The IBBI notified the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Information Utilities) Regulations, 2017. The Regulations provide for a framework for registration and regulation of information utilities. An Information Utility constitutes a key pillar of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Ecosystem, the other three being the Adjudicating Authority (National Company Law Tribunal and Debt Recovery Tribunal), the IBBI and Insolvency Professionals.


      On the Regulatory level, IBBI notified the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Fast Track Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2017. These regulations provide the process from initiation of insolvency resolution of eligible corporate debtors till its conclusion with approval of the resolution plan by the Adjudicating Authority. The process in these cases shall be completed within a period of 90 days, as against 180 days in other cases. However, the Adjudicating Authority may, if satisfied, extend the period of 90 days by a further period up to 45 days for completion of the process.


      Besides above, MCA put a major thrust on transparency through digitization of records and taking its core processes as Regulator and Facilitator online. The MCA website is regularly updated and caters to a wide range of individuals and companies. The information on the website is standardized, thus eliminating the possibility of arbitrary intervention. The ultimate beneficiary is the end user as MCA and its related branches communicate and interact with public online. Feedback from the professionals and corporations are sought online, thus making the process of gathering intelligentsia and feedback generation streamlined.


      In the Web domain, ‘MCA 21’ is an end-to-end holistic e-Governance project for compliance related services carried-out in the offices of Registrar of Companies (RoCs), Regional Directorate and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs office in New Delhi. The Project has brought a service centric approach in the delivery of public services and administration of Companies Act, specifically focusing on (i) starting a business, (ii) doing a business. The Project has been running successfully for 9 years and the Ministry has been taking continuous steps for improving the Government to Business (G2B) and Government to Citizen (G2C) services. The successful operations of the ‘MCA 21’ e-Governance Project has resulted in increase in statutory compliances and surge of revenue receipts. The Ministry has also launched the next higher level of enhancement (version 2) for deriving maximum value from this activity. The measures implemented in this process include implementation of SAP CRM and workflow, up-gradation of hardware with updated technology and enhanced monitoring tools. In addition to disseminating information through website, MCA delivers 16 resources through Government of India’s open data platform data.gov.in and VPD (View Public Document) service.


      The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has also taken initiative in Government Process Re-engineering (GPR) and has set-up the Central Registration Centre (CRC) for processing of “Name Availability” (INC-01) and “Incorporation” (INC-02/07/29) e-Forms. The GPR Exercise is in pursuance of the Ministry’s objective of providing greater “Ease of Doing Business” to corporate and is expected to result in speedier processing of incorporation related applications, uniformity in application of rules, and eradicating discretion. This process is being supplemented by intensive monitoring aimed at processing of the above e-Forms within 1 to 2 working days.
