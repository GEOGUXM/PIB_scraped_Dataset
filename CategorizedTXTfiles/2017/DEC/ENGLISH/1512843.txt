    The Union Cabinet today approved 100% Central funding of Northeast projects through Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER).
    
    While thanking the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for this historic decision with far - reaching benefits, the DoNER Minister Dr Jitendra Singh disclosed that in departure from the earlier practice of 90:10 funding of Northeast projects implying 90% funds from Centre and 10% from the respective State, from now onwards, the Union Cabinet has agreed that the entire 100% of the funding will be borne by the Centre, which will result in a huge relief to the exchequer of the State Government and will also put an end to the frequent requests received from the State Governments about lack of funds for them to contribute their share.
    
    This path-breaking decision, he hoped, will put an end to undue delay in the execution of various development projects in the region and will be a major booster for the eight States of the North-Eastern region.
    
    The new scheme under the name "North-East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme" (NESIDS), according to Dr Jitendra Singh, is being introduced from the year 2017-18, thus restructuring the existing DoNER Scheme of "Non-Lapsable Central Pool of Resources" (NLCPR).
