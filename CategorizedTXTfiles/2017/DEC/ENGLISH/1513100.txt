Further, the UGC is implementing post-doctoral fellowship for women candidates (un-employed); Swami Vivekananda single girl child scholarship for research in social sciences and PG Indira Gandhi Scholarship for single girl child for postgraduate courses to promote the enrolment of women at post- doctoral, doctoral and its feeder levels.


    Further, the UGC is providing funds for Remedial Coaching for SC/ST/OBC (Non-Creamy Layer) and Minority Community Students with a view to (i) improve academic skills and linguistic proficiency of the students in various subjects (ii) raise their level of comprehension of basic subjects to provide a stronger foundation for further academic work; and (iii) strengthen their knowledge, skills and attitudes in such subjects, where quantitative and qualitative techniques and laboratory activities are involved so that proper guidance and training provided under the programme may enable the students to come up to the level necessary for pursuing higher studies efficiently.


    It has also been informed that these are ongoing schemes in which the institution ensures proper implementation of the scheme and all payments are made by using Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) into the bank accounts of beneficiaries. These payments are routed through Public Financial Management Scheme (PFMS), a robust system for ensuring transparency in the system.
