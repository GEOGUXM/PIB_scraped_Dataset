    The Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju has called for accelerating the pace of police reforms. Addressing the Inaugural Session of the “Visionary Summit” (Dr. Anandswarup Gupta Memorial Lecture Series), organised by the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D), MHA, here today, Shri Rijiju called for tangible results ahead of the All-India Conference of Directors General/Inspectors General of Police to be held at the BSF Training Academy at Tekanpur near Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh soon. The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has called for reorientation of the Police Forces to face the new challenges, he added.


    Underlining that training is integral part of Police Modernisation, Shri Rijiju called upon the BPR&D to focus on the setting up of the National Police University National Police Technology Development Center (NPTDC) at IIT Delhi and the National Police Information Technology Center (NPITC) at Bengaluru.


    Pointing out that there is no room for complacency, Shri Rijiju said some sections have voiced concern over the erratic funding under the Modernisation of Police Force (MPF) programme since its devolution to the States. He also called for the institutionalization of an independent and effective Police Complaints Authority.


    In his address, the Director General, BPR&D, Dr. A.P. Maheshwari said there is a need for social audit of how the Police responds to different situations. The BPR&D feels the Police should be more “people oriented”, he added.
