The Ministry provides financial support for establishing such hostels by NGOs or State Governments. The cost sharing ratio amongst the Central Government, States/ UTs (other than NE and Himalayan States) and Implementing Agencies will be 60:15:25 for construction of building for Working Women Hostel/ running hostel in rented premises. For NE and Himalayan States, the ratio will be 65:10:25.


    Since its inception in 1972-73, 958 hostels have been sanctioned under the scheme of Working Women Hostel all over the country. The Ministry provides financial support to proposals for establishing such hostels by NGOs or State Governments. The proposals are approved and supported as and when they are submitted to the Ministry. During the last three years and the current year, 69 new proposals have been received under the Scheme and 54 new hostels have been sanctioned. The Scheme has been revised. With the revision of the funding pattern of the Scheme, the grant under the scheme will be released directly to the State Governments / UT Administrations.
