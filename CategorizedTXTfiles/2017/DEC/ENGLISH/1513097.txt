    The University Grants Commission (UGC) has been implementing the scheme of “ISHAN UDAY” special scholarship scheme for students of North-Eastern States since 2014 for providing financial assistance every year to 10,000 selected candidates for pursuing General Degree Course/Technical and Professional Courses including Medical and Para Medical Courses in Universities/Colleges/Institutions recognised by UGC under section 2(f) & 12(B) of the UGC Act, 1956.


    UGC has informed that disbursal of scholarships under the scheme of Ishan Uday have not been stopped. In a few cases, delay might have occurred in the disbursements of scholarship amounts due to the following factors:

     1. late joining by candidates;
     2. delay in submission of documents to the bank branches;
     3. delay in uploading of documents;

    The UGC scholarships are now disbursed to beneficiaries through the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) and Public Financial Management System (PFMS) to ensure quick, hasslefree and timely payment of scholarship dues. Further, the UGC periodically reviews and monitors timely disbursement of scholarships to the intended beneficiaries.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Dr. Satya Pal Singh today in a written reply to a Lok Sabha question.
