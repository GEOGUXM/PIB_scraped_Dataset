    A five-day training programme on various aspects of CBRN emergencies started at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport in Kolkata today. The basic training programme is being conducted by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to enhance the preparedness of Airport Emergency Handlers to respond to CBRN emergencies, encompassing threats emanating from the use of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) material at the airports.


    The programme consists of lectures as well as field training, including live demonstrations of detection and decontamination including use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Apart from equipping the airport emergency handlers to handle CBRN emergencies, the training programme will also enable them to provide medical first aid and initial psycho-social support.


    A total of 200 personnel will be trained on various aspects of CBRN emergencies. This includes sensitization of 150 working level staff in a half day module.


    NDMA is conducting the training programme in collaboration with the Airport Authority of India (AAI) and Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences (INMAS).


    After the first training programme at Chennai airport, this is the second in a series of such training programmes that have been planned for various airports across the country.
