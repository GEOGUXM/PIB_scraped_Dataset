      Development of National Waterways
      Posted On: 21 DEC 2017 4:52PM by PIB Delhi


      Under the National Waterways Act, 2016, a total of 111 waterways have been declared as National Waterways (NWs). Out of these 111 NWs, NWs-1, 2 and 3 are operational and cargo and passenger vessels are moving on them, while for NW-4, the development works under Phase-I from Muktyala to Vijaywada started in 2017. Further, for development of NW-5, preparation of DPR including Front End Engineering Design (FEED) for the construction of weirs/ barrages with navigational locks and check dams between Pankapal and Paradip/ Dhamra (Phase-I) has been sanctioned.


      The Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) has been commissioned with technical and financial assistance of the World Bank for the capacity augmentation of NW-1 (Ganga) from Haldia to Varanasi (1380 km). The JMVP aims at developing the fairway to enable safe navigation of 1,500-2,000 ton vessels. The project would be completed by 2022-23 at an estimated cost of Rs.5,369 crore.


      Out of the 106 newly declared NWs, 36 NWs are considered technically feasible for development of shipping and navigation. The list is as follows-
