      Posted On: 27 DEC 2017 7:38PM by PIB Delhi


    MHA has formulated detailed policy guidelines for assessment of proposals received from various ministries from the perspective of national security. Based on the inputs received from the agencies, MHA takes decision to grant or deny security clearance with reference to core national security i.e. unity, integrity and sovereignty of the country. MHA has not delegated the decision of granting/denying the security clearance that affect core parameters of national security i.e. unity, integrity and sovereignty of the country. However, other inputs are shared with the concerned administrative ministries to enable them to take appropriate decision, as deemed fit, in accordance with their rules, policy, procedure, guidelines, tender/contract conditions etc.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question in the Rajya Sabha today.
