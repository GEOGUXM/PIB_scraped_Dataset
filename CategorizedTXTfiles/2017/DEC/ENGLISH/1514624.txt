      No Shortage of Vaccine
      Posted On: 29 DEC 2017 4:17PM by PIB Delhi


    There is no shortage of Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) in National Immunization Program. Under the programme the vaccine is provided by Government of India to States/UTs and the vaccination is carried out by service delivery outlets consisting mainly of Government hospital, Block Primary Health Centres, Primary Health Centres, Sub Centres, outreach session sites in the villages etc. There is a global shortage of IPV. However, this reduced supply to government at present has not resulted in shortage of IPV to the State/UTs.


    As per provisional reports received from States/UTs, in current financial year from Apr-Oct, 2017 a total of 537.37 lakh doses of IPV have been supplied to the States/UTs which is more than total children vaccinated in the same period i.e. 140.95 lakh. This indicates that there is no shortage of IPV. (The State/UT-wise details are given below).

    In view of the above, the question of children remaining unimmunized against type 2 polio virus due to shortage of IPV does not arise.


    Following steps are being taken to check the shortage of IPV:

      * States/UTs are provided IPV vaccine on a monthly basis based on monthly performance report.
      * Multi dose IPV vaccine vial once open is reused for subsequent sessions as per the laid down guideline to minimize the vaccine wastage without compromising on the safety aspect of the programme.

    Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) has supported public sector manufacturer for technology transfer of IPVs based on the Sabin strains from WHO.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
