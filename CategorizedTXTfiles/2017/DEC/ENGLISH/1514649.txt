      Posted On: 29 DEC 2017 5:05PM by PIB Delhi


    In our commitment to fast track utilization of India's rights under Indus Waters Treaty, the DPR of Ujh Project was submitted by Central Water Commission to Shri Sham Lal Choudhary Minister of PHE, Irrigation & Flood Control of Jammu & Kashmir yesterday. This project will store around 0.65 MAF of waters of river Ujh (a tributary of river Ravi) to irrigate 30,000 hact. and produce more than 200 MW of hydropower. The DPR was fast tracked pursuant to decision taken in the meeting of the Task Force on Indus Waters chaired by Principal Secretary to PM in Dec 2016. This will help India to utilize a part of the flow that presently goes across border unutilized.
