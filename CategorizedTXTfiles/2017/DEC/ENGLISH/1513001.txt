      * On 16 th August 2017, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, had approved the proposal of Department of Investment and public Asset Management (DIPAM) for the strategic disinvestment (i) For setting-up an Alternative Mechanism (AM) consisting of the Finance Minister, Minister for Road Transport & Highways and Minister of Administrative Department, to decide on the matters relating to terms and conditions of the sale from the stage of inviting of Express of Interests (Eols) till inviting of financial bid; and (ii) For empowering the Core Group of Secretaries (CGD) to take policy decisions with regard to procedural issues and to consider deviations as necessary from time to time for effective implementation of decisions of CCEA. The approval will help in speedy completion of strategic disinvestment transactions.

    V. Department of Expenditure (DOE)


      * General Financial Rules (GFRs), 2017 were released on 7th March, 2017 to enable an improved, efficient and effective framework of fiscal management while providing the necessary flexibility to facilitate timely delivery of services.

      * 7th CPC - On 28 th June 2017, the Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi approved the recommendations of the 7 th CPC on allowances with some modifications. The revised rates of the allowances came into effect from 1 st July, 2017 benefitting more than 48 lakh Central Government Employees.

    While approving the recommendations of the 7 th CPC, the Cabinet had decided to set-up the Committee on Allowances (CoA) in view of substantial changes in the existing provisions and a number of representations received. The 7 th CPC adopted a three-pronged approach in examining a total of 197 allowances which involved an assessment of the need for continuation of each allowance, appropriateness of the set of people covered by the allowance and rationalisation which involved clubbing of allowances with similar objectives. Based on the examination on these lines, the 7 th CPC recommended that 53 allowances be abolished and 37 be subsumed in an existing or a newly proposed allowance. For most of the allowances that were retained, the 7 th CPC recommended a raise commensurate with inflation as reflected in the rates of Dearness Allowance (DA). A new paradigm was evolved to administer the allowances linked to risk and hardship. The myriad allowances, their categories and sub–categories pertaining to civilians employees, CAPF and defence personnel were fitted into a table called the Risk and Hardship Matrix (R&H Matrix).


    Promoting Digital Platforms

      * Monitoring of funds through PFMS – On 27 th October 2017, the Union Finance Minister, Shri Arun Jaitley made the use of Public Finance Management System (PFMS) mandatory for all the Central Sector Schemes of the Government of India to help in tracking and monitoring the flow of funds to the implementing agencies. These Central Sector Schemes (CSS) with a Budgetary Outlay of Rs.6,66,644 crore covered over 31% of the total Central Government expenditure during the Financial Year 2017-18 . PFMS, with the capability of providing real time information on resource availability, flows and actual utilization has tremendous potential to improve programme/financial management, reduce the float in the financial systems by enabling ‘just in time’ releases and also the Government borrowings with direct impact on interest costs to the Government.

      * Mobile friendly format website: The Finance Minister Shri Jaitley also launched the new website of the Department of Expenditure.

      * The Controller General of Accounts (CGA), launched the upgraded version of Central Pension Accounting Office (CPAO) website (www.cpao.nic.in) on 30th Nov, 2017 primarily to cater to the needs of central civil pensioners and other stakeholders in the Ministries/Departments and Banks. It provides a single window for both accessing pension related information and facilitating grievance Redressal of pensioners.


    Public Expenditure Management in the North Eastern States


      * The Department of Expenditure, also took several initiatives in the area of Public Expenditure Management in the North Eastern States with special focus on capacity building of the State Government officials and integration of the State Treasuries with the Union Public Financial Management System (PFMS) in order to improve the efficiency and transparency of public expenditure. The Government also released advance grant-in-aid of Rs.51.30 crore to Arunachal Pradesh for rescue and relief operations on account of flash floods


    Public Expenditure on Infrastructure


      * The Government has consistently increased Public Expenditure on Infrastructure in order to boost employment and provide renewed impetus to economic growth. The Government of India received Rs.7,67,327 crore (47.9% of corresponding BE 17-18 of Total Receipts) upto October 2017 comprising Rs. 6,33,617 crore Tax Revenues (Net to Centre), Rs. 95,151 crore of Non-Tax Revenues and Rs.38,559 crore of Non-Debt Capital Receipts.

Rs.3,37280 crore has been transferred to the State Governments as Devolution of Share of Taxes by Government of India in this period.


      * There has been a Special thrust on key development sectors including Rural Roads, Housing, Railways, Power, Highways and Digital Infrastructure. The CAPEX target of the Government of India for 2017-18 was Rs. 3.09 lakhs crore, which is 31.28% higher than last year, out of which Rs.1.46 lakhs crore was spent on capital works till September 2017. The Government launched a new Umbrella program for Road Building of 83,677 km of roads involving CAPEX of Rs.6.92 lakhs crore over next 5 years with an outlay of Rs.5,35,000 crore that would generate 14.2 crore man-days of jobs.
