    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will visit Mizoram and Meghalaya tomorrow where he will inaugurate various development projects.
    
    “The enchanting and effervescent Northeast calls! Looking forward to visiting Mizoram and Meghalaya tomorrow, where various development projects will be inaugurated. These projects will add impetus to the development journey of the Northeast.
    
    It is my privilege to be dedicating the Tuirial Hydropower Project to the nation at tomorrow’s programme in Aizawl. The completion of this project is a boon for the people of Mizoram.
    
    Giving wings to our Yuva Shakti, DoNER has set up a Rs. 100 crore Northeast Venture Capital Fund. Tomorrow I will be distributing cheques to entrepreneurs from this fund. A spirit of enterprise among the Northeast’s youth augurs well for the empowerment of the region.
    
    In Shillong I will inaugurate the Shillong-Nongstoin-Rongjeng-Tura Road. This project will improve connectivity and further economic growth. I will also address a public meeting.
    
    We see immense potential in the Northeast and are committed to doing everything for the region’s overall progress”, the Prime Minister said.
