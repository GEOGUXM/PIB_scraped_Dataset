      Posted On: 20 DEC 2017 1:59PM by PIB Delhi


    ISRO has been pursuing a conscious approach of building up and nurturing the industrial capabilities in the country to maximally support the Indian Space Programme. In order to step up the launch capacity within the country, ISRO is in the process of involving Indian industry in a greater role to meet the increased national requirements and enable commercial launch services in order to enhance the capacity and capability of managing the PSLV programme on an end-to-end basis. This is proposed to be carried out through the formulation of a plan to empower Indian Industry including the quality assurance and safety procedures.


    ISRO has been utilising the Indian industry in both the public and private sector for the development of space technology since 1976. In order to ensure the smooth supply chain of hardware, components and sub-systems to the Indian Space Programme, ISRO has been continuously engaged in technology development and hand-holding several industries within the country. This has enabled ISRO to realise the majority of the manufacturing requirements of the ISROâ€™s launch vehicles and satellites through industry. The industry participation has shown continuing growth both in addressing technological complexity and quantum of work.


    The relevant process documents and safety documents for carrying out the various activities are in place and are being followed meticulously, which will be utilised along with training, in the event of the industry undertaking these activities.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
