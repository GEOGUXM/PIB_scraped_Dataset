      Posted On: 22 DEC 2017 4:09PM by PIB Delhi


    This year World AIDS Day was observed on 1 st December, 2017. The theme was “25 Years of National AIDS Control Programme”. The National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI), 2017-24 was released . The “Mission Sampark” was also launched to bring back People Living with HIV who have left treatment after starting Anti Retro Viral Treatment (ART).


    The aim is to achieve elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and Syphilis as well as elimination of HIV/AIDS related stigma and discrimination by 2020. On prevention of new infections, National AIDS Control Programme(NACP) aims to achieve 80% reduction in new HIV infections by 2024 from baseline value of 2010. Further, by 2024, the target is to ensure that 95% of those who are HIV positive in the country know their status, 95% of those who know their status are on treatment and 95% ofthose who are on treatment experience effective viral load suppression.


    There is no shortage of funds, drugs and testing kits meant for NACP. However, sometimes the shortage of drugs and testing kits is reported from some locations and these are immediately managed by relocating supplies from other locations.


    National AIDS Control Programme is based on three pillars-Prevention, Care-counselling and Treatment.Prevention programme for High risk Groups (HRGs) and bridge population is implemented through Targeted Interventions and provision of services including condoms, needle syringes, Opioid Substitution Treatment, linkages to various facilities like HIV testing and Health check-ups for STIs.


    Free Counselling and treatment to all People Living with HIV (PLHIV) is being provided through 537 ART centers and 1108 Link ART centers.
