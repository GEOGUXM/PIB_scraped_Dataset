    Good Morning Friends,
    
    Usually the season of winter also starts with Diwali. However, this is the impact of Global Warming and Climate Change that one does not feel the intense cold these days.
    
    However, our Winter Session is getting started. And I believe that in this Winter Session, that is beginning in 2017 and will continue in 2018, several important issues of the government, that have far reaching impact, will be brought before the Parliament.
    
    There should be a good debate, there should be a positive debate, and the debate should take place with innovative suggestions… only then the time of the Parliament will be properly utilized for the benefit of the country.
    
    I am confident of it, and even yesterday we had an ‘All Party meeting’ in which there was a common voice that the session of the parliament should be utilised in the proper manner for taking the country forward.
    
    And I also hope that if the house will function in a positive manner then the country will be benefitted, democracy will be strengthened and a new trust for fulfilling the expectations and hopes of common people will be created. Thank you very much.
