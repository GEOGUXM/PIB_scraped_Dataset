      Ministry of New & Renewable Energy issues Concept Note on Solar PV Manufacturing Scheme
      Posted On: 21 DEC 2017 4:50PM by PIB Delhi


    The Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) has prepared a concept note on Solar PV Manufacturing Scheme to build up manufacturing capacity of solar PV modules, cells, wafers/ ingots and polysilicon in India. It is proposed to support manufacturers of solar PV cells and modules to expand and upgrade the existing facilities or to set up new manufacturing facilities to enable the domestically produced solar product to be competitive with international solar products. The objective is to eventually have the entire spectrum of manufacturing â€“ from poly-silicon to modules.


    In conjunction with the ambitious target set by the country for achieving 100 GW of solar power capacity by the year 2022, the Government desires that this be accompanied with a robust solar manufacturing capacity in the country. The objective of the Government is to reduce the dependency on foreign manufactures by making domestic manufacturers competitive with international manufacturers, through manufacture of quality solar PV equipment in the country. As a result of this, India should convert from a net importer country to a net exporter country for solar PV equipment and become a global player in solar manufacturing. An extensive manufacturing capacity would also create skilled jobs in the country.


    The details of the policy are available on the website of the Ministry at http://www.mnre.gov.in. Comments on the policy are invited and the same can be sent by 31st December 2017.
