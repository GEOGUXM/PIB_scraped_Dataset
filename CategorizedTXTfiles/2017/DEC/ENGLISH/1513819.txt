    In case of doctors, every year, on the basis of vacancies projected by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) conducts Combined Medical Services Examination for recruitment of Medical officers of GDMO sub-cadre of Central Health Services. For filling up of vacant posts belonging to Specialists sub-cadres of Central Health Service, requisitions are also sent to UPSC. Based on the recommendations received from UPSC, candidates are given offer of appointment. Pending recommendations from UPSC, concerned units are permitted to make contractual appointments against the vacant posts, as a stop-gap arrangement, in public interest, till the time regular incumbent joins the post.


    The rest of the vacant posts other than the doctors are filled as per the requirement of the respective Hospitals in terms of Recruitment Rules on regular basis, through contractual appointment as a stop-gap arrangement and on outsource basis on the basis of approval received from the Ministry.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
