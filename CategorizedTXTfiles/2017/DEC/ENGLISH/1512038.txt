    The Ministry of Shipping has taken significant strides in the last three years to make India’s presence felt on the global maritime map. Various steps have been taken to provide a robust legislative framework, create capacities, impart skills to people, and create an enabling business environment for growth of the maritime sector in the country.


    Recently, Shri Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister of Shipping, Road Transport & Highways, Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation laid the foundation stone of a Rs 970-crore International Ship Repair Facility (ISRF) at Cochin Shipyard Limited, which will make Cochin a global ship repair hub. Giving boost to the maritime sector under Sagarmala, a world class Center of Excellence in Maritime and Ship Building (CEMS) is also being set up with campuses at Vishakhapatnam and Mumbai, which will provide industry-relevant skill development, equip students with employable engineering and technical skills in the port and maritime sector.


    These steps have resulted in India gaining prominence in the global maritime arena. In the recent elections to the IMO Council India secured the second highest number of votes and was re- elected to in Category-B, that is states with the largest interest in international seaborne trade. The IMO Council consists of 40 member countries. Shri Gadkari described it as a proud moment for the country.
