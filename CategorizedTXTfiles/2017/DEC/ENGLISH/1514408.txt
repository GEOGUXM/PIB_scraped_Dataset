      Posted On: 27 DEC 2017 7:25PM by PIB Delhi


    Though India is not a signatory to the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol thereon, its track record in dealing with or providing protection to refugees has been internationally acclaimed. There is a provision for grant of Long Term Visa (LTV) under various instructions issued by the Government from time to time. As per the available information, 486 Myanmar nationals (Rohingyas) and 2154 Afghanistan nationals are staying in India on LTV as in 2016.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question in the Rajya Sabha today.
