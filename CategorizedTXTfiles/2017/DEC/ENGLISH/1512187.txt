    The Ministry of Women & Child Development has launched a contest inviting creative minds to design a logo and suggest a tagline for its prestigious 'National Nutrition Mission'. It is an opportunity for citizens who aspire to see their design displayed on a National platform.


    The Government of India approved the National Nutrition Mission to ensure holistic development and adequate nutrition for pregnant women, mothers and children. The programme targets to reduce the level of stunting, under-nutrition, anaemia and low birth rate. Accordingly, it was felt pertinent to launch an appropriate logo and tagline to generate awareness among the masses.


    The Minister of Women and Child Development, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi has said, “As has been the practice of the Ministry to engage with citizens, the Ministry proposes to invite entries from public for the same. In keeping with the overwhelming response received on similar contests run on the Ministry’s Social Media platform, it is proposed to award a prize money of Rs 1 lakh to the winner.”


    Participants are welcome to send either a logo or a tagline or both. In case the logo and tagline selected by the jury are from separate participants, then the prize money would be split.


    Details of the contest are available on the Facebook & Twitter accounts of Ministry WCD (@MinistryWCD). Last date to submit entries on nnm.mwcd@gmail.com is 17th December, 2017.
