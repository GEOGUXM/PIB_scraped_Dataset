        A team of 05 IAF mountaineers is now embarking on the mountaineering expedition to Mt Vinson (4897 M) on 13 Dec 17. The expedition was flagged off by Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa PVSM AVSM YSM VM ADC, Chief of the Air Staff, on 08 Dec 17 in a befitting ceremony.


        The team is led by Gp Capt RC Tripathi VM(G) who also have taken part and led many IAF expeditions including ‘Mission Seven Summits’. The team has recently completed pre expedition training and acclimatisation in Leh and Siachen from 24 Nov 17 to 03 Dec 17 and is now ready to undertake the arduous and challenging mountaineering expedition in most far flung and remote Antarctica.


        Successful ascent of Mt Vinson will make IAF the first organisation in India to achieve this unique feat of scaling Seven Summits.


        IAF has promoted adventure activities among its personnel. In 2011, a women's expedition scaled Mt Everest successfully and in 2017 a joint IAF-BSF women camel expedition covered 1386 Km distance along western border in 47 days. IAF is also committed to the cause of environment and in Sep this year IAF expedition to Mt Stok Kangri restored the environment at base camp.
