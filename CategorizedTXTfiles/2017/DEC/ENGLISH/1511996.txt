    Shri Singh also raised the issue of Indian exports of grapes and rice suffering on account of arbitrary Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) set by European Commission. He suggested a mutually acceptable solution can found to this issue, as these limits were set by EU without any scientific assessment being shared to India.
    
    The two Ministers signed a new MoU for cooperation in Agriculture and Phytosanitary issues that will replace the one signed in 2008. The MOU provides a good framework for cooperation in this field. Earlier in the day, the Minister met Mr. Gilbert F Houngbo and congratulated him on being appointed as the President, IFAD.
    
    Shri Radha Mohan Singh said that India has always had an active association with IFAD ever since it was set up in 1977 as the 13th specialized agency of the United Nations. India is a founder member of IFAD, a key contributor among the member Countries, participates actively in the Fund's governing bodies, and holds a permanent seat in IFAD Executive Board. It currently holds the chairmanship of the Governing Council and of the Evaluation Committee.
    
    Union Agriculture Minister further said that he welcomes the new country strategy for IFAD engagement in India for the period 2018-2024, which proposes to strategically focus on 'smallholder food and agricultural production systems that are remunerative, sustainable and resilient' and achieving Indiaâ€™s goal of doubling farmers' incomes. Shri Singh also appreciated IFAD plans to establish sub-regional hubs in New Delhi to serve as a sub-regional hub, covering Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives besides India. This will significantly enhance opportunities for further investment, technology and knowledge cooperation, including South-South Technical Cooperation (SSTC).
    
    Shri Singh said India has contributed 37 million USD in the 10th replenishment of IFAD for the period 2016-2018. He further added that he looks forward to enhanced cooperation between India and IFAD in the coming years. Together, we can do much more by expanding the collaboration with the private sector, and to engage more systematically in South-South Technical Cooperation involving public and private organizations as well as farmers and their organizations.
