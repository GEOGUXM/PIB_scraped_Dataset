      Posted On: 27 DEC 2017 2:27PM by PIB Delhi


    Armament systems in Indian Army are categorized as Small Arms, Mortars, Field Guns, Medium Guns, Howitzers, Armoured Platform based Armament, Missiles and other long range vectors. These categories are based on parameters such as calibre, range desired / achieved etc. The authorization and holding of arms and ammunition is as per the operational requirement of the Indian Army. Adequate reserves have been authorized to cater for contingencies. There are adequate stocks of arms and ammunition with the Indian Army and it is well equipped for meeting any operational requirement.


    The Government has approved a proposal for manufacturing of ammunition for Indian Army by Indian Industry. Request For Proposal (RFP) under Open Tender Enquiry for the said proposal has been issued on 25th & 27th March 2017.


    While no formal Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for transfer of latest technology in arms and ammunition have been signed with any country, the issue of access to modern defence technologies is an important aspect of our defence cooperation with foreign countries.


    Making up of stocks of arms and ammunition to desired level is a continuous process, the requirements for which are identified every year and procurements are undertaken accordingly. Some of the measures to ensure adequate availability of ammunition include placing of a Five-Year Roll on Indent on OFB, finalization of Ammunition Road Map in respect of certain identified ammunition and procurements thereof. Further, financial power has been delegated to the Army to meet any emergent requirement and to enable them to maintain military preparedness at all times.


    This information was given by Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Smt Supriya Sule and others in Lok Sabha today.
