      Rain Water Harvesting Structures
      Posted On: 21 DEC 2017 2:58PM by PIB Delhi


    Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has prepared a conceptual document titled “Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Ground Water” - 2013 which provides information about area specific artificial recharge techniques to augment the ground water resources based on the availability of source water and capability of subsurface formations to accommodate it. The Master Plan envisages construction of about 1.11 crore artificial recharge structures in urban and rural areas at an estimated cost of about Rs. 79178 crore. This comprises around 88 lakh recharge structures/ facilities utilizing rainwater directly from roof top and more than 23 lakh artificial recharge and rainwater harvesting structures for conserving surplus runoff to augment the ground water resources. It is estimated that annually about 85,565 MCM of surplus run-off is to be harnessed to augment the ground water. The Master Plan is available in public domain on the website of the Ministry / CGWB and has also been circulated to the State Governments for implementation. State-wise rural and urban artificial recharge structures as proposed in the Master Plan are given below. It is also pertinent to mention here that water resources is a State subject and thus respective State Government utilize the guidelines issued by the Ministry in their on-going schemes for improved ground water resources.
