    Recently, the guidelines have been proposed for revision by CGWA and circulated to all States / UTs and uploaded on website of this Ministry, Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) and CGWA for comments from all stakeholders.


    The major provisions in the revised guidelines, inter-alia, include pan India coverage, decentralization of NOC issuing authority, exemption to users drawing ground water through non-energised means and pump upto 2 HP from a single tube well for drinking & domestic purpose and introduction of water conservation fee to be used by States for effective ground water management.
