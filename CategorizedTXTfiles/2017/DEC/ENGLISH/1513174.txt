The use of force should be guided by objectives of restoring peace, dispersal of violent unlawful assembly with use of such force as is required to minimize the casualty but without compromising safety for Law Enforcement Elements and peace loving citizens. The hierarchy of usage of forces inter-alia includes use of rubber bullet/ plastic bullets.
