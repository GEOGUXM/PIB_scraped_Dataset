    State/UT-wise doctor-patient ratio is not maintained centrally. However, as per information provided by Medical Council of India, there are a total 10,41,395 allopathic doctors registered with the State Medical Councils/Medical Council of India as on 30th September, 2017. Assuming 80% availability, it is estimated that around 8.33 lakh doctors may be actually available for active service. It gives a doctor-population ratio of 0.63:1000 as per current population estimate of 1.33 billion. WHO prescribes a doctor population ratio of 1:1000. The doctor population ratio in some neighboring developing countries and developed countries is at given below (Source: WHO):

    The emphasis of government on increasing the number of doctors in the country will improve the doctor population ratio. There are 479 medical colleges in the country with an intake capacity of 67352 MBBS seats. 13004 MBBS seats have beenadded in the last three years.


    The Government is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for Establishment of new medical colleges attached with district/referral hospitals in 58 districts in under-served areas in the country. There are other Centrally Sponsored Schemes for increasing UG seats and PG seats in existing Government medical colleges. To increase the availability of faculty and specialist doctors in the country, one time increase in PG seats was permitted this year after the revision of teacher student ratio. In all, over 5800 PG seats have been added this year. Minimum Standard Requirements (MSRs) for medical colleges including requirement of land, faculty, staff, bed/ bed strength and other infrastructure has been rationalized to facilitate setting up of new colleges.
