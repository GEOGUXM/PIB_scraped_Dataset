      Steps to overcome trade deficit
      Posted On: 27 DEC 2017 5:56PM by PIB Delhi


      Indiaâ€™s merchandise export registered a positive growth of 11.27% during the last six months in 2017-18 (June-Nov) as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. The trade deficit has increased from 57.18 US$ billions in 2016-17 (June-Nov) to 74.27 US$ billions in 2017-18 (June-Nov). Trade deficit depends upon relative fluctuations in the import and export of different commodities due to the global and domestic factors such as demand and supply in domestic and international markets, currency fluctuations, cost of credit, logistics costs, etc.

      The Government announced a major relief package for exporters in October 2017 by extending the Advance Authorization (AA) / Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) / 100% EOU schemes to sourcing inputs etc. from abroad as well as domestic suppliers. Holders of AA / EPCG and EOUs would not have to pay Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST), Cess etc. on imports. Also, domestic supplies to holders of AA / EPCG and EOUs would be treated as deemed exports. During the mid-term review of Foreign Trade Policy, export incentives under Merchandise Exports from India (MEIS) have been increased by 2% across the board for labour intensive MSME sectors leading to additional annual incentive of Rs 4,567 cr. This was in addition to already announced increase in MEIS incentives from 2% to 4% for Ready-made Garments and Made Ups in the labour intensive Textiles Sector with an additional annual incentive of Rs 2,743 cr. Further, incentives under Services Exports from India Scheme (SEIS) have also been increased by 2% leading to additional annual incentive of Rs 1,140 cr.


      The Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Shri C.R.Chaudhary gave this information in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
