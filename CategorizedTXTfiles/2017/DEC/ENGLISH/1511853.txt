    To help passenger to contact security personnel onboard a running train, Indian Railways has decided to earmark seats for security personnel of train escort team. In a recent circular issued from Ministry of Railways, provision of one side lower berth (berth no.63) in coach S1 has been earmarked in Sleeper Class coach in the entire train in which this security staff is travelling. If the train is being escorted by GRP, one berth will be earmarked for GRP and in case the train is escorted by RPF, one berth in Sleeper class will be earmarked for RPF. In case no RPF/GRP is escorting the train, no accommodation will be earmarked for them.


    In case of any untoward incident or for any security related issues during journey, passengers may contact the security staff at the earmarked accommodation.
