    As per the available information, registration certificates of more than 23,000 NGOs have not been renewed.


    The registration certificates of NGOs are cancelled under section 14 of Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), 2010 for violation of provisions of FCRA, 2010 and Rule made thereunder.


    The support-desk of FCRA section responds to the emails. Online interaction is also ensured by the support staff to resolve such matters. An aggrieved NGO can also petition the Central government to revise its order under Section 32 to the FCRA.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question in the Rajya Sabha today.
