      Posted On: 20 DEC 2017 12:12PM by PIB Delhi


    To reduce the delay in the loan sanctioning process following initiatives have been taken under PMEGP Scheme:

      * In order to streamline the process of application flow and fund flow and to bring in transparency and better financial management an online PMEGP e-portal has been introduced. All applications and fund flow will be processed online in stipulated time frame.
      * For speedy completion of EDP training, these are being conducted through Departmental Training Centres as well as RSETIs/RUDSETIs. An MOU has been executed between KVIC & National Centre for Excellence of RSETIs (NACER).
      * Implementing Agencies are instructed to encourage and provide necessary assistance to the beneficiaries for filing online application by setting up of help desks.
      * To resolve the bottlenecks in the PMEGP online system related to banks, Nodal Officers at the Head office level are nominated for all nationalized banks.

    The number of jobs created under PMEGP during the last three financial years and current year is given below:
