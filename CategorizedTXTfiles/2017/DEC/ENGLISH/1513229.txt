    Section 149 of Companies Act, 2013 read with the corresponding rules requires every listed company and prescribed class of companies to have a women director. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has also mandated under SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 for appointment of at least one woman director on the boards of listed companies. Government and SEBI have not prescribed any target for companies to have 20% women on the boards of the companies by the year 2020.
