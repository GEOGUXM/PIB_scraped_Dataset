    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind has greeted the nation on the eve of the New Year 2018. In a message the President has said:-


    "New Year is a time for reflection, for resolutions and for renewal. As 2018 dawns, let us all commit ourselves to a happier and wholesome period ahead – to strengthening the bonds that unite all of us as Indians. And to working for a cleaner and greener environment that we can bequeath to our children.


    New Year wishes to all fellow Indians, whether at home or anywhere in the world. May the coming year bring joy and prosperity to your lives and to your families – as well as to the global community with which we share so much".
