      Posted On: 28 DEC 2017 5:51PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government has extended demand incentives to 1,63,997 hybrid/electric vehicles (xEVs) under FAME India Scheme.


    The phase-1 of FAME India Scheme, which was originally for a period of 2 years i.e. up to 31st March 2017, was extended for a further period till 31st March 2018, with slight modification to the extent of discontinuation of the available benefits to the Mild Hybrid technology under the scheme with effect from 1st April 2017.


    The notification of the scheme provides for its review appropriately based on the outcome and experience gained in the Phase 1 of this scheme. Accordingly, based on the third party evaluation of phase-1 of the FAME India Scheme, the benefits available to mild hybrid technology was withdrawn.


    At present, there are no plans to subsidize expensive battery components of electric vehicles in the Department of Heavy Industry, Ministry of Heavy Industries & Public Enterprises. However, R&D projects and EV technologies, including for battery development, are being supported under FAME India Scheme. The existing FAME India Scheme does not provide for extending demand incentive to battery components of electric vehicles.


    This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Rajya Sabha today.
