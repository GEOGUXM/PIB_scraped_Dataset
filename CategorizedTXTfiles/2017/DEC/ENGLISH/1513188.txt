    During the second day of the Training of Trainers workshop for utilising the Sendai Monitor to develop action plans for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) here today, participants were given practical hands-on training wherein they were divided into groups and each group worked upon the preparation of action plans.


    Objectives and actions proposing out of the four priorities of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR), 2015-2030, were deliberated upon.


    The SFDRR is the first major agreement of the post-2015 development agenda and identifies targets and priority actions towards reducing disaster risks and implementing development that is both resilient and sustainable. India is a signatory and is thus committed to work towards achieving the targets enshrined in the Framework.


    Further, established linkages between SFDRR 2015-30, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change were discussed.


    Interactive sessions during the day focussed on the preparation of a holistic action plan, which, in turn, will highlight the future requirements or actions.


    The three-day workshop, organised by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in collaboration with the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction-Global Education and Training Institute (UNISDR-GETI), was inaugurated by Shri Kiren Rijiju, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, yesterday.
