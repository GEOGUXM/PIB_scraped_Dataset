      * CSIR Aroma Mission

    CSIR has contributed significantly in the development, nurturing and positioning of essential oil-based aroma industry in the country. This has led to creation of an ecosystem benefitting the industry, farmers and next generation entrepreneurs. The effort has had been aimed at socio-economic development on one hand and creation of desired capability and capacity on the other. In doing so, several CSIR laboratories have developed and deployed desired technologies in the domain. The segment is maturing and there is global connect in a significant manner, providing newer opportunities which are associated however with several challenges. Industry thus needs to reposition itself in this important segment. CSIR has committed itself to contribute for the purpose in a mission mode. CSIR Aroma Mission has been conceptualized for the purpose and is being made operational.


    The objectives of the Mission have been divided into eight verticals. These include:

      * Development of superior varieties and their agro-technologies and assessment of their suitability for specific agro-climatic regions;
      * Promotion of cultivation and processing of aromatic crops, enhancing area under selected aromatic crops along with enabling interventions including setting up of distillation units and catalysing setting up of cooperatives for marketing of the produce;
      * Value-addition of aromatic crops (High-end aroma chemicals and products) ;
      * Skill development activities;
      * Intellectual property generation, valuation and management;
      * Entrepreneurship development/Spin-offs;
      * Business development; and
      * Making public aware of Mission activities and achievements using appropriate interface.

      * CSIR Phytopharmaceuticals Mission


    Medicinal plants have played a key role in human health since time immemorial. Plants and their parts have been in use since ancient times as medicines for the treatment of a range of diseases. In spite of the great advances observed in modern medicine in recent decades, plants still make an important contribution to global healthcare. As per World Health Organization (WHO), because of poverty and lack of access to modern medicine, about 65-80% of the world's population living in developing countries depends essentially on plants for primary healthcare.


    The CSIR Mission on phytopharmaceuticals aims to improve the availability (through cultivation) of such medicinal plants which are in high demand by global and domestic industry involved in the preparation of medicines of Indian traditional systems. Under this mission it is proposed to prevent exhaustion of medicinal plants from their native locations by identifying the elite germplasm and conserving it by cultivation and in gene banks. Improved varieties along with their agrotechnologies will be developed to increase productivity and profitability per unit land area, and to make use of such areas which are affected by abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, flood, shade etc. Chemical processes will be developed for the preparation of standardized extracts and enriched fractions of selected medicinal plants to transfer the value-addition technologies to the entrepreneurs to promote use and export of value-added material instead of the raw plant material. Efforts would be made to translate the potential clinical leads in different CSIR laboratories to develop them into phyto-pharmaceutical drugs which would be affordable and acceptable at global standards.


    The verticals are:

      * Captive cultivation of medicinal plants;
      * Conservation and revival of engendered and threatened medicinal plant species;
      * Technology Packages for production of GMP grade medicinal plant extracts;
      * Phytopharmaceutical development from important medicinal plants;
      * Intellectual Property generation, valuation and management;
      * Design & Development of Digital Library of Indian Medicinal Plants & Natural Products; and
      * Showcasing CSIR technologies / products / services with appropriate interface.

      * CSIR Mission on Sickle Cell Anemia


    Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) is the most common blood related disorder in India with a high prevalence among ethnic groups that have a socio-economic disadvantage, such as tribal populations. Every year approximately 5,00,000 children are born with SCA worldwide with India accounting for nearly 50% of the cases.


    SCA is a genetic disease caused by a point mutation in the sixth codon of the β-globin expressing gene resulting in the replacement of glutamic acid by valine, which under deoxygenation state oligomerizes with α-globin and gives rise to a type of haemoglobin named as HbS (Haemoglobin sickle). The mutated valine favours the hydrophobic interactions between the β subunits of the hemoglobin tetramers leading to the HbS polymerization and formation of long hemoglobin fibers. These fibers deform the disc shaped RBCs to sickle shaped cells. The sickle shaped cells lose flexibility with reduced oxygen carrying capacity and induce dehydration in the cells. Due to irregular shape of these cells, they are prone to physical stress leading to hemolysis and capillary occlusion. Individuals suffering from sickle cell disease show symptoms such as body pain, clotting, dyspnea, anaemia, jaundice, pneumonia, repeated infection etc. Their lifespan is usually reduced to 5-25 years with 50% of children with SCA dying before the age of 5. Hence early and affordable detection, treatment as well as preventive measures are important in managing this disease.


    CSIR has developed a Mission Mode Project on Sickle Cell Anaemia through brainstorming and domain expert group discussions. The CSIR Mission on Sickle Cell Anaemia aims at:

      * Managing Genetic Burden of Sickle Cell Anaemia and Understanding Genetic Basis of Differential Response to Hydroxyurea Therapy;
      * Drug discovery and development for management of SCA;
      * Genome editing and stem cell research approach for the treatment of SCA; and
      * Development and on-ground implementation of an affordable, accurate and accelerated diagnostic kit.

    The project will be implemented by CSIR-IIIM, Jammu; CSIR-CCMB, Hyderabad; CSIR-IICB, Kolkata; CSIR-IMT, Chandigarh; CSIR-IGIB, Delhi; CSIR-NCL, Pune and CSIR-URDIP, Pune.

      * CSIR’s Jammu Kashmir Arogya Gram Yojana: Value Addition to Farmer Income and Better Land Utilization through Medicinal and Aromatic Plants


    CSIR has achieved multiple breakthroughs in developing medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) that grow in different kinds of soils e.g. water logged soils, saline lands, desert prone and semi-arid soils, drought hit regions, snow bound areas or waste lands. CSIR developed varieties not only harness all available cultivable land but enhance incomes to farmers. Returns are much higher than conventional agriculture. The estimated area under cultivation over the years from such interventions by CSIR is more than 3.5 lakh hectares with an estimated value of Rs 4000 crores and generated employment of more than 7.00 crore man-days.


    CSIR’s ‘Jammu Kashmir Arogya Gram Yojana’ was launched in July 2015 as an effort for handholding of farmers to enable value added agriculture of aromatic and medicinal plants. 10 Districts (Kathua, Udhampur, Reasi, Doda, Ramban, Kishtwar, Samba, Poonch, Jammu and Rajouri) comprising kandi land/rainfed/ wasteland/unutilized land/snow bound areas are covered under this initiative. Through this initiative 107.82 ha of land has been brought under cultivation, which has resulted in employment generation of 26,959 mandays, and benefitted 399 farmers. The efforts that targeted at rural skill set enhancement through farm based activities and technology support, provided training to 1760 personnel on specific agro-technologies.


    CSIR has also developed agri-implements such as Krishi-Shakti (tractor for small land holdings), Air-Assisted Electrostatic Sprayer for Crops, Inter-row rotary cultivator for wide-row crops, Digital Grain Moisture Analyser, etc. for enhancing productivity and reducing drudgery of farmers.


    Recently, CSIR has launched two Mission programmes – Aroma and Phytopharmaceuticals - with significant stakeholder focus, targeting niche yet cost effective agri- and value-add technologies for high national impact.


      * CSIR Developed Improved Samba Mahsuri: A Diabetic Friendly Rice


    Samba Mahsuri (SM) is one of India’s most popular and highly prized rice varieties because of its high yield and excellent cooking quality. It is cultivated in more than 2 million hectares of land in the country. However, SM is highly susceptible to many pests and diseases including the serious bacterial blight (BB) disease. BB is one of the serious production constraints of rice in India, limiting rice yields by upto 30 % in many of the states in which SM is cultivated. This disease is a particular problem because effective chemicals for managing the disease are not available.


    Recognizing the seriousness of the problem of BB, CSIR-CCMB and ICAR-IIRR jointly developed BB resistant derivatives of SM and one of the breeding lines was released as a new variety under the name, Improved Samba Mahsuri (ISM) in the year 2008. The BB resistant lines of SM, when evaluated across the country through multi-location trials, exhibited high yield and grain quality similar to the original parent, SM and also showed excellent resistance to BB in disease in locations prone to BB infection.


    After its release of ISM, its cultivation area has been steadily increasing and upto 2016 it is estimated to have been cultivated in an area of 130,000 hectares across the country. ISM matures 7-10 days earlier than Samba Mahsuri and farmers in East Godavari attested that it is more tolerant to lodging than other popular varieties. ISM has another unique feature of low glycemic index (i.e. a value of 50.99), which is amongst the lowest value for several rice varieties tested. Foods with glycemic index (GI) value below 55, like ISM, are considered highly suitable for consumption by patients suffering from diabetes as consumption of foods with low GI results in slow release of glucose into the bloodstream, thus reducing the ill effects of the diabetes. Therefore, ISM, in addition to possessing desirable attributes like high yield, fine-grain type, bacterial blight resistance, premium market price etc., also has a unique advantage of low GI, thus enhancing its market potential and profit earned by the farmers.


    Popularization of ISM amongst rice farmers was supported by CSIR through its CSIR-800 program. The ongoing research in this collaborative program of CSIR-CCMB and ICAR-IIRR is aimed at developing derivatives of Samba Mahsuri that have higher yield, mature early and possess tolerance to other biotic stresses.


      * CSIR Developed Handheld GPS-Enabled ‘Ksheer Tester’ – System for Detection of Adulteration in Milk to Reduce Public Health Risk


    n order to address the grave problem of adulteration in milk, CSIR has developed an electronic system, named ‘Ksheer-Scanner’, a low cost portable system with user friendly features, which detects contaminants in just 40-45 seconds. The system is useful for on-the-spot milk testing by food inspectors. Over 55 Ksheer-Scanner systems have been deployed at dairies in Goa, Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.


    Recently, a new handheld GPS-enabled ‘Ksheer Tester’, a variant of the benchtop system, Ksheer-Scanner, has been developed by CSIR for checking adulteration in milk. The device would enable any person to track the location of the tested sample of milk and receive the test results through SMS on the device. The handheld milk adulteration tester, with system capabilities comparable to those of Ksheer Scanner which was meant for dairy-level inspection, is aimed for domestic usage. User friendly salient features include single button operation, fast measurement time (less than 60 Seconds) and the ability to detect contaminants like urea, salt, detergent, soap, boric acid and hydrogen peroxide down to low levels ranging from fractions of a percent to parts per million depending on the adulterant. A cost of below Rs. 10,000 per piece enables small communities and dairy-processing businesses to adopt this cost-effectively.


    · CSIR developed Mercury-free UV lamps for Water Purifiers – Green Solutions for Societal Problems


    The CSIR-Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-CEERI), Pilani has developed mercury-free plasma (MFP) UV-lamp for water disinfection systems which would provide water free of environmentally and health hazardous mercury. The developed MFP-UV-lamp is a better alternative for mercury-based UV lamps and has been well-tested in the household water purifier systems. This is a first of its kind worldwide. The technology can also be used for sterilization of food, medical equipment, surfaces, ill-skin conditions, air-conditioners and air fresheners for hospitals, etc. The technology has been transferred to two companies for its mass production.

    The main feature of this system is that it measures Wind Speed, Wind Direction, Pressure, Temperature and Relative Humidity along with Visibility which are critical for aviation safety. A mandatory system required for Airport operations has been developed, as per the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) requirements. In view of indigenous efforts, saving of foreign exchange to the country also accomplished.


      * Timescale of ISRO’s GPS ‘NavIC’ gets synchronized to the Indian Standard Time (IST) generated by the “Primary Atomic Clocks” of CSIR-NPL


    A symposium on Indian Strategy on Quality Infrastructure was held on 29th November, 2017 to highlight the role of accurate and precise measurements for building the quality infrastructure of the country. The symposium highlighted the importance of measurements and the ways through which it facilitates international trade, and enhances the quality of life and the environment. The symposium was attended by more than 400 foreign delegates from 31 countries.


    The symposium witnessed a landmark occasion, as the Timescale of Indian GPS (NavIC - NAVigation with Indian Constellation) developed by Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) was synchronized to the Indian Standard Time (IST) generated by the “Primary Atomic Clocks” of CSIR-NPL. The link was dedicated to the Nation.


    MoU between CSIR and ISRO for Time and Frequency Traceability


    CSIR-NPL is the custodian of Indian Standard Time (IST) and has the national responsibility for realization, establishment, maintenance and its dissemination. As a ‘National Metrology Institute’, CSIR-NPL has the mandate to maintain ‘Indian Standard Time’ (IST) using the most up-to-date technologies. The National Time Scale is contributing to the Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) maintained by International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) and has uncertainty of 20 nano-second.


    A MoU was signed between CSIR and ISRO on August 04, 2017 under which CSIR will provide time and frequency traceability to ISRO. Under the MoU, CSIR-NPL will provide the UTC traceability to the Time Scale of the Indian Regional Navigational Satellite System (IRNSS), an independent navigation satellite system, being developed by ISRO. The all in view GPS P3 technique will be used by CSIR-NPL for providing traceability to ISRO’s time scale. Due to the criticality of precise time signals for satellite navigation, Two Way Satellite Time and Frequency Transfer (TWSTFT) system between CSIR-NPL’s Laboratory in New Delhi and ISRO’s Laboratories in Bangalore and Lucknow has been setup to provide few nanoseconds uncertainty to the ISRO’s time scale.


    In satellite based navigation systems, the spatial resolution is decided by precise synchronization of the clocks embedded in the end user’s device with clocks in the satellites. The accuracy of satellite navigation systems depends on the proper synchronization of on-board clocks. For navigation purpose atleast four satellites are needed to know someone’s position accurately. The time have to be incredibly accurate as light travels 30 centimetres in one nanosecond (or 300 million metres in one second) so that any tiny error in the time signal could put a defined activity by a very long way.


      * Lithium Ion Battery: India’s First Fabrication Facility by CSIR
