      Units assisted under PMEGP
      Posted On: 20 DEC 2017 12:17PM by PIB Delhi


    The number of units assisted under Prime Ministerâ€™s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) varies depending upon the budgetary allocation under the scheme. The average project cost is increasing over the years. During 2010-11 the project cost was 5-6 lakhs per project while during 2016-17 the average project cost is 7-8 lakhs. As the fund allocation is nearly constant, the number of units setup under PMEGP decreases due to increase in average project cost. Details of margin money allocated, margin money utilized, number of units setup and estimated employment generated during last three years and current year upto 30.11.2017 are given below
