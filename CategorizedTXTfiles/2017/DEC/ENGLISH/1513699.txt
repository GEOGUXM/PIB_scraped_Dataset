    The Intelligence Bureau (IB) completed 100 years of its existence in 1987 and celebrated 1988 as its Centenary Year. On December 23, 1887, the Central Special Branch was set up under orders issued in London by the Secretary of State for India. The Central Special Branch was renamed as the Criminal Intelligence Bureau and, thereafter, as the Intelligence Bureau.


    The yearlong Centenary celebrations in 1988 were marked by seminars, workshops and lectures on national security issues in different parts of the country in which the IB personnel interacted with public leaders, administrators, intellectuals and officers of other security agencies. The Centenary Year culminated in a week-long celebration in the capital. Dr Shankar Dyal Sharma, then Vice President of India, addressed the closing function on December 22, 1988 by delivering a lecture on the subject 'The Dynamics of Security Environment'.


    After the first lecture by Dr Shankar Dayal Sharma, the Centenary Endowment Lecture was institutionalised and is being organised in the third or fourth week of December every year. Twenty-nine such lectures have been delivered by eminent speakers on a wide range of issues related to India's security, the development of the Indian polity and on the state of the nation.


    The Centenary Endowment Lecture provides a wide cross section of Intelligence Bureau personnel an opportunity to hear intellectuals, leaders and thinkers on some contemporary issues. For all personnel of the Intelligence Bureau, the annual gathering is also an occasion on which they rededicate themselves to the highest levels of professionalism and reaffirm their commitment to maintain the unity and integrity of the country. In addition to IB personnel, the invitation is also extended to the select officers from MHA, PMO, Cabinet Secretariat, CPOs etc and ex-DIBs and Retired Senior Officers who have been associated with the IB/CPOs based in and around Delhi. Besides, the Probationer IPS Officers are also invited to the lecture. The address by the guest speaker is followed by a 30-minute interaction with the audience.
