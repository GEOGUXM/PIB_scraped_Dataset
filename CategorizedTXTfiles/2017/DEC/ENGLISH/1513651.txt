    The Prime Minister of India launched Phase-I of RO Pax Ferry service between Ghogha and Dahej in Gulf of Cambay in Gujarat on 22 nd October 2017. This project is implemented by Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB).


    The above project is the first of its kind in India as it was executed in the area of world’s second highest tidal range. The ferry service significantly reduced the travel time and distance between Ghogha & Dahej compared to the road journey. The distance between the two places by road is 268 km with an average travel time of 8 hrs. However, through the sea route it is reduced to only 31 km with average travel time of 1.5 hr.


    On National Waterway – 2 (river Brahmaputra), a regular Roll On and Roll Off (Ro – Ro) ferry service started between Dhubri and Hatsingmari in July, 2017. This Ro Ro service provides a direct link between Assam and Meghalaya avoiding circuitous route of 220 km. through Jogighopa to reach Hatsingmari.


    The total cost of the Ghogha and Dahej, RO Pax Ferry service project, as estimated by the GMB, is Rs.615 crore including terminal construction, capital dredging and other costs. Under the Sagarmala Programme, the Ministry of Shipping has sanctioned 50% cost of the capital dredging i.e. Rs.117 crore and has released Rs.58.5 crore in 2016-17 and Rs.40.68 crore in 2017-18.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Shipping and Road Transport and Highways Shri Pon. Radhakrishnan in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
