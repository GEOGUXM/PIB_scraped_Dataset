    The National Career Service (NCS) Project is a Mission Mode Project of the Ministry of Labour & Employment for transformation of the National Employment Service to provide a variety of employment related services like career counselling, vocational guidance, information on skill development courses etc. through a web-based portal. The NCS services are available online on the National Career Service portal (www.ncs.gov.in) supported by multilingual Call Centre/Helpdesk and is accessible by all users. The NCS service can also be availed directly through the Employment Exchanges, Career Centres, Common Service Centres etc. In addition to the above procedure, advertisement of vacancies are to be mandatorily placed at the NCS portal which has been developed primarily to connect the opportunities with the aspiration of youth.


    The Central Government recruitment agencies such as Staff Selection Commission, Railway Recruitment Board etc schedule the conduct of various examinations in such a way that they do not, as far as possible, clash with each other.


    This was stated by the Minister of State in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions and Minister of State in the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office, Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply to a question by Dr. Boora Narsaiah Goud in the Lok Sabha today.
