    Health being a State subject, the implementation of the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010 falls within the remit of the States/Union territories. The Government is persuading the States who have adopted the said Act for its strict implementation from time to time.


    Health is a State Subject and as per the provisions of the Clinical Establishments Act, the State Government authorities namely District registering Authority at District level and State Council for Clinical Establishments at the State level are responsible for implementation and monitoring of the Act including taking corrective measures in case of violation of the Act. Data regarding such violations is, however, not compiled and maintained centrally.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
