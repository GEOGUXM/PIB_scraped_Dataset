    The following measures have been taken to achieve the target of measles elimination by 2020:


    · Government of India introduced measles vaccine across the country in 1985 under the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP). To further reduce the measles burden, a second dose of measles vaccine was introduced in the country in the year 2010.


    · With an aim to increase the full immunization coverage to 90% by December 2018 including improving measles vaccine coverage particularly in pockets with low immunization coverage, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has launched Intensified Mission Indradhanush on 8th October 2017. The Intensified Mission Indradhanush is being carried out in 173 districts and 17 urban areas across 24 states of the country and three rounds (Oct, Nov and Dec) have been completed since the launch.


    · An India Expert Advisory Group on Measles & Rubella (IEAG-MR) has been established, comprising national and international experts, to provide technical guidance on the disease elimination efforts from time to time. The group has met twice since its formulation.


    Tuberculosis:


    The National Strategic Plan (NSP) for elimination of Tuberculosis (2017-25) has been formulated by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.


    In addition to the existing strategies under Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP), the NSP focusses on:


    · early diagnosis of all the TB patients, prompt treatment with quality assured drugs and treatment regimens


    · suitable patient support systems to promote adherence.


    · engaging with the patients seeking care in the private sector.


    · prevention strategies including active case finding and


    · contact tracing in high risk / vulnerable population


    · airborne infection control.


    Under the National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to the States/UTs to strengthen their health-care system based on the requirements posed by the States/UTs in their Program Implementation Plans. Vacancies in the State are filled by respective State/District Health Societies under NHM. Regular follow up is done with the States to ensure that the vacant positions are filled up.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
