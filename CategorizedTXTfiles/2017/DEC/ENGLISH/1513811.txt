    Â· early diagnosis of all the TB patients, prompt treatment with quality assured drugs and treatment regimens


    Â· suitable patient support systems to promote adherence.


    Â· engaging with the patients seeking care in the private sector.


    Â· prevention strategies including active case finding and


    Â· contact tracing in high risk / vulnerable population


    Â· airborne infection control.


    Under the National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to the States/UTs to strengthen their health-care system based on the requirements posed by the States/UTs in their Program Implementation Plans. Vacancies in the State are filled by respective State/District Health Societies under NHM. Regular follow up is done with the States to ensure that the vacant positions are filled up.
