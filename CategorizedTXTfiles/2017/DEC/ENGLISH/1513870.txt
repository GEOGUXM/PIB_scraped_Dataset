    The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme [now renamed as Anganwadi Services under Umbrella ICDS Scheme] envisages the Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) as “honorary workers” from the local community who come forward to render their services, on part time basis, in the area of child care and development.


    AWWs and AWHs are honorary workers. Further, the Supreme Court of India in a ruling of 07.12.2006 in Civil Appeal No.4953-4957 of 1998 State of Karnataka & Ors. Vs. Ameerbi & Ors. The Hon’ble Supreme Court has also held that AWWs/AWHs do not hold any civil post.


    With an aim to provide each Anganwadi Centre with its own building, joint guidelines have been issued by Ministries of Women & Child Development, Rural Development and Panchayati Raj on 17.02.2016 for construction of 4 lakhs Anganwadi Centre buildings across the country by 2019 under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) in convergence with Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme. Under the convergence plan, expenditure up to Rs.5 lakh per AWC building for construction is allowed from MGNREGS. Expenditure beyond Rs.5 lakh per AWC including finishing, flooring, painting, plumbing, electrification, wood work, etc. is to be met from the ICDS funds, to the extent of Rs.2 lakh.


    Drinking water and sanitation facilities in these AWC buildings are leveraged from the funds available with Panchayati Raj Institutions under 14th Finance Commission.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Women and Child Development, Dr. Virendra Kumar in reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
