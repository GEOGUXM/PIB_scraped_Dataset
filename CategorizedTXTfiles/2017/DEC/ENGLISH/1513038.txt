    The forestry interventions are an integral activity of the larger programme of Ganga Rejuvenation (Namami Gange) initiated by the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG). A Detailed Project Report (DPR) on forestry interventions for Ganga was prepared by Forest Research Institute (FRI), Dehradun. The DPR adopts a multifaceted approach emphasizing on appropriate forestry intervention by way of protection, habitat management, afforestation, catchment treatment-soil and moisture conservation works, ecological restoration of vital riparian forest buffer, bioremediation, improved livelihood of forest dependent communities and forest dwellers and alternate income generation activities through regulated tourism and awareness.


    A river scape covering an area of 83,946 km2 has been delineated all along the basin in the five Ganga River bank states namely, Uttrakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal.


    The project is to be implemented in two phases, 1st phase is to be implemented over a five years period from 2016-2020. The total projected financial outlay over 5 years is Rs. 2293.73 crores. After successful completion of 1st phase, DPR for 2nd phase will be prepared for scaling-up and replication in additional sites and will be implemented from 2021 to 2027.


    This information was given by Union Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Dr. Satya Pal Singh in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
