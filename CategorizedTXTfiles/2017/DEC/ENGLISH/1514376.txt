      Posted On: 27 DEC 2017 5:54PM by PIB Delhi


      Significant achievements have been made under the Make in India initiative since its launch on 25 th September, 2014.


      ‘Make in India’ initiative was launched on September 25, 2014 with the objective of facilitating investment, fostering innovation, building best in class manufacturing infrastructure, making it easy to do business and enhancing skill development. Action Plans for 21 key sectors were identified for specific actions under (i) Policy Initiatives (ii) Fiscal incentives (iii) Infrastructure Creation (iv) Ease of Doing Business (v) Innovation and R&D (vi) Skill Development areas.


      Details of achievements under the ‘Make in India’ initiatives in the focus sectors are as follows :


      1. Foreign Direct Investment


      The total Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflow was USD 160.79 billion between April 2014 and March 2017 – representing 33% of the cumulative FDI in India since April 2000. In 2015-16, FDI inflow crossed the USD 50 billion mark in one fiscal year, for the first time ever. In 2016-17, FDI inflow stood at a record of USD 60 billion, highest ever recorded for a fiscal year ever. According to IMF World Economic Outlook (April 2017) and UN World Economic Situation Prospects 2017, India is the fastest growing major economy in the world, and is projected to remain so in 2017 and 2018. FDI policy and procedure have been simplified and liberalized progressively. Key sectors that have been opened up for FDI include Defence Manufacturing, Food Processing, Telecommunications, Agriculture, Pharmaceuticals, Civil Aviation, Space, Private Security Agencies, Railways, Insurance and Pensions and Medical Devices.


      2. Ease of Doing Business


      Steps taken to improve ease of doing business include simplification and rationalisation of existing rules. As a result of the measures taken to improve the country’s investment climate, India jumped a massive 30 places to 100th in World Bank's ease of doing business rankings as per World Bank Group’s ‘Doing Business 2018: Reforming to Create Jobs’ report. This is driven by reforms in the areas of Starting a Business, Construction Permits, Getting Credit, Protecting Minority Investors, Paying Taxes, Trading across Borders, Enforcing Contracts, and Resolving Insolvency.
