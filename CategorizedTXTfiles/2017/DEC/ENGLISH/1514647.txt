      As per the directions of the Honâ€™ble Supreme Court in W.P. No. 56/2004 (Prajwala Vs. Union of India & Ors.), an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) constituted for the purpose, has prepared a Trafficking of Persons (Prevention, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2017 for various aspects of trafficking. The Bill defines some new forms of trafficking as aggravated or otherwise, identified on the basis of gaps in existing legislations and prescribes stringent punishment. The Bill proposes establishment of well-coordinated institutional mechanism from District to National level for prevention and investigation of offences as well as for rescue, protection and rehabilitation of victims of trafficking. It also proposes creation of rehabilitation fund for welfare and rehabilitation of victims of trafficking. The proposal at present is under consideration.
