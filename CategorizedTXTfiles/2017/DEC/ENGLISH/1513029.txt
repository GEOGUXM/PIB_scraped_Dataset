      Ashram Schools For ST Students
      Posted On: 18 DEC 2017 4:56PM by PIB Delhi


      The scheme “Setting up of Ashram Schools in Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) Areas” is demand driven and implemented through the State Governments/UTs. As per extant provisions of the Scheme, State Governments are eligible for 100% central share for construction of all Girls’ Ashram Schools and also for construction of Boys’ Ashram Schools in naxal affected areas. The funding pattern for the other Boys’ Ashram Schools is on 50:50 basis, while cent percent assistance is given to UTs for construction of both Girls’ and Boys’ Ashram Schools. The ashram schools are managed by the State concerned.


      It has been proposed by the Government to discontinue the Scheme from 2018-19 and subsume the intervention in the scheme ‘Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS)’. The proposition has already been recommended by the Expenditure Finance Committee.


      Amount of funds allocated under the Scheme “Setting up of Ashram Schools in Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) Areas” during last three years and current year are given below:
