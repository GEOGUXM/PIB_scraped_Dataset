      Awareness Regarding Air Pollution
      Posted On: 22 DEC 2017 7:26PM by PIB Delhi

      “India has one of the largest urban systems in the world, with many cities located in agro-climatic zones which have high levels of particulate matter due to natural reasons such as Gangetic plains. India is also home to over 16% of global population, though it has only 2.5% of the geographical area of the world. Due to these reasons India has a large number of cities that do not meet norms related to air quality standards. Further, the methodology for assessment of pollution in various parts of world is not same. Countries can be ranked on the basis of different criteria pollutants with different results. As such it is difficult to compare different countries since they differ in their various characteristics.

        The Government has taken several steps to address air pollution which inter alia, include notification of National Ambient Air Quality Standards; setting up of monitoring network for assessment of ambient air quality; introduction of cleaner / alternate fuels like gaseous fuel (CNG, LPG etc.), ethanol blending, launching of National Air Quality index; universalization of BS-IV by 2017; leapfrogging from BS-IV to BS-VI fuel standards by 1st April, 2020; notification of Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules; banning of burning of biomass; promotion of public transport network; streamlining the issuance of Pollution Under Control Certificate; issuance of directions under Section 18(1)(b) of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and under Section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986; installation of on-line continuous (24x7) monitoring devices by major industries, etc. Abatement of pollution is largely the responsibility of State Governments, local bodies, agencies of the State Governments and industrial units. The Government of India supplements the efforts of State Governments, etc. Government provides funds to CPCB for its various activities, including air pollution mitigation efforts. The details of the funds provided by government to CPCB is at Annexure I. State-wise details of funds released to various Monitoring Agencies during last three years and current year for ambient air quality monitoring as operational and maintenance cost under National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP) is given at Annexure-II.


        National Air Quality Index (NAQI) has been launched, which classifies air quality into good, satisfactory, moderate, poor, very poor, and severe categories. Government has also undertaken a number of awareness building programs to highlight the issue of air pollution. Ministry launched campaigns such as ‘Harit Diwali and Swasth Diwali’ and ‘Swachh Hawa for Swachh and Swasth Bharat’ covering over two lakh schools in the country.”
