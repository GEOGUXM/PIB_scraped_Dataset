    Since 1949, 7th December is observed as the Armed Forces Flag Day throughout the country to honour the martyrs and the men in uniform who valiantly fought on our borders to safeguard the country's honour.


    The Armed Forces Flag Day Fund was setup in 1993 to extend support to disabled ex-servicemen, war widows, children of martyrs and other such beneficiaries who need our care and support.


    This year the Ministry of Defence is organizing a weeklong digital campaign from 1st to 7th December 2017 which shall be celebrated as the Armed Forces Week. The campaign will endeavour to bring together the entire nation to express solidarity with the Armed Forces Personnel.


    The aim of the campaign to generate awareness about the ‘Armed Forces Flag Day Fund’ and encourage people to contribute generously. Several cashless payment methods have been setup and made available. You can send your contributions via PayTM number ‘ 8800462175 ’ & UPI code: armedforcesflagdayfund@sbi . To contribute using Credit/Debit Card or Net Banking log on to ksb.gov.in/armed-forces-flag-day-fund.htm


    You can show your sense of pride by wearing the flag representing three services from1st to 7th December 2017. These flags are available at all government offices. Alternatively, you can also download the printable version of the flag from ksb.gov.in


    This campaign falls under the Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman’s aim to ensure full support to the welfare of ex-servicemen and their families, a priority she enunciated immediately after taking charge of the Ministry.
