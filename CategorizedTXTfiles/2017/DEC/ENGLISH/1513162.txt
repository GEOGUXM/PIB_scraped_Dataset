    The Government has proposed to launch a new health protection scheme which will provide health cover up to Rs. One lakh per family belonging to poor and economically weaker families. The contours of the scheme are yet to be finalized. This proposed scheme will replace RSBY once it is approved.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
