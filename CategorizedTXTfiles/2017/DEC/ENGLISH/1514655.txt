    Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) is Governmentâ€™s major reform initiative to re-engineer the existing delivery processes, ensuring better and timely delivery of benefits using Information & Communication Technology (ICT). As on date, 400 schemes from 56 Ministries/ Departments are being implemented under DBT. As a process, Centrally Sponsored Schemes are implemented through State Governments and granular level details are being maintained by the respective State Governments. DBT focuses on better targeting of beneficiary, timely disbursal of benefits and curbing of pilferage by de-duplication, elimination of ghost beneficiaries etc.


    This was stated by Shri Pon. Radhakrishnan, Minister of State for Finance in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
