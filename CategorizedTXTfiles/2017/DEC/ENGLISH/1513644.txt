    The Minister also informed about the revised target for installing solar capacity from 20 GW to 100 GW by 2022 for grid connected solar power projects. The target for wind power projects has been fixed as 60 GW by 2022. Shri Singh stated that in order to achieve these targets, the tendering trajectory for solar and wind power projects has been formulated as under:
