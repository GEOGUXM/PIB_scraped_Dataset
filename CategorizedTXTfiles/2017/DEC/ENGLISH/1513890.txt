    “As per IIT Kanpur report, sources of pollution during winter in Delhi include secondary particles (25 - 30%), vehicles (20 - 25%), biomass burning (17 – 26%), municipal solid waste burning (9 - 8%) and soil and road dust. Sources of pollution during summer include, coal and fly ash (37 - 26%), soil and road dust (26 – 27%), secondary particles (10 - 15%), biomass burning (7 - 12%), vehicles (6 – 9%) and municipal solid waste burning (8 – 7%). The emission from use of pet coke and furnace oil is expected to contribute in respect of Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and secondary sulphate component of particulate matter (PM). The total secondary sulphate particulates contribution in ambient PM10 concentration in Delhi is in the range of 4.5-15.3% during winter and 4.7-7 % during summer, while in case of PM2.5it is 8-21% and 7.6-12.5% in winter and summer seasons, respectively. SO2 has been observed to be well within the prescribed standards in Delhi. Particulate matter is observed to be beyond the specified norms, especially during winter, in Delhi.
    
    The Supreme Court imposed a ban on use of pet coke and furnace oil on 24.10.2017 in Delhi-NCR states. Since the ban has been imposed recently, its impact is yet to be assessed. Various categories of industries such as cement, thermal power plant, fertilizers, nitric acid, lime kiln, ceramic, glass, foundry, reheating furnaces, calcium carbide, aluminium, boiler based industries etc., use pet coke and furnace oil for various purposes including as fuel. Under Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Environment (Protection) Act, 1986; monitoring and compliance is being ensured through concerned State Pollution Control Board.
    
    The Government has notified environmental standards for various categories of industries including those using fuel such as petroleum/petcoke and furnace oil, under Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for large categories of industries. Notifying environmental standards for different categories of industries is an ongoing process. Petroleum coke or petcoke and furnace oil which are by-product of crude refining process are also used as fuel by several industries/boilers. The Ministry has issued a draft notification inviting public suggestions and objection vide S.O.No.1343 (E) dated 25/10/2017 laying down emission standards for SO2 and NOX for industrial boilers using petcoke and petcoke blend.
    
    There is no proposal to completely ban use of pet-coke and furnace oil throughout the country for all industrial sectors.”
    
    This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Mahesh Sharma, in reply to a written question in Lok Sabha today.
