    Historical Background :


    First Electric EMU train on Western Railway line was started on 5 th January, 1928 between Colaba to Borivali. BB&CI built the first Carshed at Bombay Central on 5 th January,1928 for maintenance of EMU rake. Another shed at Kandivali was established in the year 1984-85. With the increase in rake holding over the years a new shed was commissioned at Virar in April, 2013 to undertake maintenance of new technology EMU rakes. Over the last 90 years, the suburban rail service has grown rapidly. Today Western Railway runs 1355 suburban services carrying about 35 lakhs passengers per day with 89 Rakes. Initial rakes were of 4 coach configuration, which were later upgraded to 9 Car Rake in 1958. 12 Car Rakes were introduced in 1990. Today all the Rakes have been converted to 12 Car Rakes. First 15 Car Rake, which is longest suburban train, was introduced by Western Railway on 21.11.2009.As of now 54 services of 15 car are being run. By continuing the above saga, the First ever “ Broad Gauge Air-conditioned AC EMU of 12-car rake fitted with Indigenous 3-phase Propulsion system of M/s. BHEL ” on Indian Railway has been received in May-2017 on Western Railway for fulfilling the long standing demand of Mumbai suburban commuters.EMU Rolling Stock organisation of BCT Division has completed all the Static and Dynamic trials of the rake in co-ordination with RDSO on priority. To make the daily commute more comfortable, this rake is being introduced on 25 th December,2017 to the Mumbai Suburban passengers on Western Railway adding a new milestone in the Mumbai Suburban History.

The door leaves were sliding inside pockets provided at the door opening. Following passenger safety features were provided in the automatic door closing system:


    Ø Train will not start or take traction if any of the doors of the train is open.


    Ø Automatic door will not open till the train comes to a complete halt.


    Ø Door can open both from inside and from outside of the coach with the help of emergency exit device. This device can also be used if the door fails to open automatically when required. However, this emergency exit device will not operate when the train is in motion.


    Ø The location of emergency door opening device (operating rotary handle near door) and the method of its operation is displayed inside the coach for guidance to the passenger.


    Ø To avoid injury to passengers during closing operation of the door, doors will re-open thrice if any obstruction detection takes place. After first detection of obstruction there will be audio alarm to caution the passengers about door closing.
