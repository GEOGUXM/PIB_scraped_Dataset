    Shri Ashok Arora, Author and Motivational Speaker, delivered the 26th lecture of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) ‘Lecture Series’ on “Making Life Musical for Professional Excellence”, here today


    In his interactive lecture, the speaker said that all problems today are due to lack of training of the mind and the soul. The main theme of his talk was on the need to encourage honesty and to shame the corrupt, which he felt would be most effectively done through the power of positive love rather than fear. He spoke about the need to build national character as a means of building a better nation, and felt that in their work, all officers should strive for prevention of corruption as being more effective than punishment alone. The importance of fundamental duties and the role of different institutions such as the judiciary were also explained, with several examples drawn from our recent history. The central idea was that professional excellence could best be achieved by inner development of the personality, not by externally acquired knowledge alone.


    Full time and part time CVOs based in Delhi/NCR attended the lecture along with CMDs, Board of Directors and other officers of the vigilance administration. The Central Vigilance Commissioner, Shri K.V. Chowdary was also present.


    The lecture was available for online viewing as it was webcast live through NIC. The link to the recorded webcast is available on the Commission’s website www.cvc.nic.in.
