      Identification of Workers in Unorganised Sector
      Posted On: 27 DEC 2017 3:13PM by PIB Delhi


    The Unorganized Workersâ€™ Social Security Act, 2008, defines an unorganized worker and provides for a self-declaration by such worker confirming that he or she is an unorganized worker.


    There is no centralized national database of unorganized workers in India. Accordingly, it has been decided to create a national platform for unorganized workers. A proposal to issue a Unique ID i.e. Unorganized Workers Identification Number (UWIN) and allotment of a Aadhaar seeded Identification number to them without issuing any smart card, has been approved by the Central Government with an estimated cost of Rs. 402.7 Crore to be implemented in two years during 2017-18 and 2018-19.


    This information was given by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Minister of State (I/C) for Labour and Employment in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
