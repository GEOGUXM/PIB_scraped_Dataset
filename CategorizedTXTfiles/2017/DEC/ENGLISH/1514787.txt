Metro rail projects of approximately 700 kms are under construction in 12 cities and about 700 kms are under planning by various State Governments.


      Metro Rail Policy- 2017 was unveiled during the year. This policy will fill up the much needed gap for ascertaining and enhancing the feasibility of metro rail projects from economic, social and environmental perspective. It also aims to focus on systematic planning and implementation of metro rail systems and act as a guide to state governments for preparing comprehensive proposals for metro rail projects. This policy will also enable greater private participation and innovative financing through Transit Oriented Development (TOD) and Value Capture Finance (VCF). It also provides for rigorous appraisal process. This policy suggests a range of Public Private Partnership models. It focuses on maximizing non - fare box revenues and revenues through commercial developments at stations and other allocated land.


      MoHUA has issued National Transit Oriented Development (TOD) policy on 01.05.2017, which aims to promote planned and sustainable urban centers with high density, mixed land-use development within an influence zone of 500-800 meters of mass transit stations. The policy aims to enable transformation of cities from private vehicle dependent development to public transport oriented development . TOD increases the accessibility of the transit stations by creating pedestrian and Non-Motorized Transport (NMT) friendly infrastructure like footpaths and cycle tracks that benefit large number of people, thereby increasing the ridership of the transit facility and improving the economic and financial viability of the system. Many cities have strengthened their public transport by developing mass rapid transit system (MRTS ) such as metro rails and bus rapid transit systems (BRTS). The national TOD policy will help these cities to formulate city specific policies to efficiently use these systems.

      REVISION OF PRE-2016 PENSION CASES AS PER 7 TH CPC:


      As per CPAO database , MoHUA had to revise 41,910 pension cases of pre-2016 as per 7th CPC out of which 40,027 cases have been revised and submitted to CPAO . The balance cases left include pensioners who are drawing minimum pension and the same may not result in upward revision.


      To achieve this target within the stipulated time i.e November 2017, a comprehensive strategy was adopted which included holding regular meetings with CPWD and other stake holders, personally contacting a large number of pensioners whose records were not available vide sending SMS on their mobiles, contacting on their telephones, writing letters to them, etc. was adopted . M/oHUA is the first major Ministry to complete revision of pension cases.
