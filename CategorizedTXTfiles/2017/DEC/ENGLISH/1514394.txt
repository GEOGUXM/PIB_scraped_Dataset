      Target for Atomic Energy
      Posted On: 27 DEC 2017 6:47PM by PIB Delhi


    The target of nuclear energy generation in the XI Five Year Plan (2007-2012) was 163,395 Million Units (MUs), which was revised to 124,608 MUs at MTA stage.


    The actual generation in the XI Five Year Plan was 109,642 MUs. The shortfall in generation was on account of lower generation due to non availability of indigenous uranium in the required quantity, delay in fruition of international cooperation resulting in delay in availability of imported uranium and shifting of completion of the Kudankulam (KKNPP-1&2, 2 X 1000 MW) and Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) projects to XII Plan.


    The Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project Units 1&2 (KKNPP 1&2) has been completed and these units are currently in commercial operation. The delay in completion of these units was one of the reasons for the shortfall in achievement of generation target of XI five year plan. The project completion was delayed on account of local protests in 2011 severely impeding work for about six months and its domino effect, litigations against the project in courts and fulfilling of directions of Supreme Court by Nuclear Power Corporation India Limited (NPCIL) and other agencies. The Government and Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited enhanced public outreach manifold to allay the apprehensions and concerns of local people about safety of the project and all related issues.


    This was stated by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.
