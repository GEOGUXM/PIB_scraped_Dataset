    The Vice-President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that the Vedas preach world peace, universal brotherhood and welfare of all.


    Inaugurating the World Conference on Vedas, “Vishwa Ved Sammelan”, here today, he said the Vedas have great relevance to humanity. The Yajurveda mentions that the knowledge of Vedas is meant for the well-being of the entire humanity. The Vedas do not refer to any caste or community, he added.


    Underlining that the Vedas are the earliest works of ancient knowledge and philosophy in India, the Vice President said our civilization, culture, thoughts and philosophy are rooted in the Vedas. He said the Vedas are the source of knowledge and guide us to advance in economic, social, educational and political fields and also in maintaining high moral and ethical standards.


    The Vedic philosophy states that truth, non-violence, patience, penance and spiritual uplift are the foundations of a human life. Vedas convey the message of religious harmony, equality and nation’s progress. Quoting the Rigveda, Verse 5.60.5, Shri Venkaiah Naidu said no individual in the society is either big or small, according to Vedas.


    The Vice President said Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati, the builder of modern India and Founder of Arya Samaj, had given the message “Back to the Vedas” to the world. This has been endorsed by the renowned Orientalist, Max Mueller. Renowned philosopher and Nobel Laureate Maurice Maeterlinck had said the Vedas are the only and incomparable source of all knowledge.
