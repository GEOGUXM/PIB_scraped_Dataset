      Republic Day 2018 – Fly-Past – An IAF Appeal
      Posted On: 27 DEC 2017 3:12PM by PIB Delhi


    In view of the fly-past at heights varying from 60 to 500 meters and the associated flight safety concerns posted by birds, the IAF appeals to all citizens of Delhi and its neighbourhood to keep their areas clean and avoid throwing eatables, garbage, dead animals or carcasses in the open in all the days leading upto 26 January.


    Responsible citizens are also requested to alert the nearest Air Force Unit or Police Station and report instances of carcasses found in the open. The vulnerable areas that come in the route include Palam, Najafgarh drains, Tihar Jail, War Cemetery and areas adjoining Rashtrapati Bhawan.


    Birds pose a serious threat to aircraft flying at low level. Eatables thrown out in the open attract birds, to ensure a safe fly-past, the citizens of Delhi and its neighbourhood are requested not to throw eatables and garbage in the open. Also, if they find any carcass out in the open they are requested to report to the nearest Air Force Unit/ Police Station to arrange for its prompt disposal.
