    Shri Mansukh L Mandaviya, Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways, Shipping and Chemicals & Fertilizers informed in a written reply to Lok Sabha today, that the Government has made it mandatory for all four wheel passenger and goods vehicles sold on and after 1st December, 2017 to be fitted with FASTag by the manufacturer of the vehicle or its authorized dealer.


    Shri Mandaviya also told the House that Electronic Fee Collection (EFC), a digital form of user fee collection, was rolled out across the country on 25th April, 2016 by the Government with the inclusion of multiple issuers and multiple acquirer banks with National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) as the Central Clearing House (CCH).


    So far, 407 toll plazas across the country have been enabled with EFC lanes on either side of the toll plaza and 8,12,870 RFID tags have been issued. The total transaction count since Jan, 2017 to December 15, 2017 under e-mode stands at 10.12 Cr and the revenue collected under e-mode for the same period is Rs 2852 Cr. Depending upon the feasibility at fee plazas, Government is targeting to have all existing lanes as FASTag enabled by converting them to Hybrid EFC lanes having all the payment options, Shri Mandaviya informed.
