    A recent study carried by Massachusetts General Hospital, United States in five centers in India, which include the SreeChitraTirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Trivandrum, All India Institute for Medical Sciences, New Delhi, Nizamâ€™s Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Post Graduate Institute for Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, and Christian Medical College, Ludhiana, reported that 30% of ischemic stroke India is due to atherosclerosis involving the arteries supplying the brain, followed by 25% due to strokes from clots in the heart that get dislodged and obstruct blood flow to the brain (embolization).


    The study was funded by the US National Institutes of Health and the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India. This study was published in the Stroke journal in November 2017.


    In contrast to the western population, the mean age of stroke incidence in India is only 58 years. The study has also revealed that tobacco use (32%), hypertension (61%), and diabetes mellitus (36%) are significantly higher in stroke population. The findings draw attention to significant morbidity associated with stroke, with 44% of patients disabled for life after stroke. While ambulance services have an important role in getting patients with acute stroke on time to the hospital, only 1.8% of the patients avail ambulance services to reach the hospital. Though stroke is an emergency, compared to heart attack and trauma, there is lack of use of ambulance services for stroke.
