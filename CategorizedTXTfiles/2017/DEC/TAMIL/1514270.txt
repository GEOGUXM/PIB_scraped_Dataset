    The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the extension of term of the Commission to examine the issue of sub-categorization of Other Backward Classes, by twelve weeks i.e. upto 2nd April, 2018. The extension of tenure will enable the Commission to submit a comprehensive report on the issue of sub-categorization of OBCs, after consultation with various stakeholders.


    The Commission was constituted under article 340 of the Constitution with the approval of President on 2nd October, 2017 and it was stipulated that it would submit its report within twelve weeks from the assumption of charge by the Chairperson.


    Background:


    The Commission, headed by Justice (Retd.) Smt. G. Rohini commenced functioning- on 11th October, 2017 and has since interacted with all the Stats/UTs having reservation for OBCs, and the State Backward Classes Commissions. The Commission has requisitioned data from 197 Higher Education Institutions regarding admission of OBCs to higher education courses during the last three years and has also sought data regarding recruitment of OBC persons in Government jobs during the last three years in Government Departments, Public Sector Banks and Financial Institutions as well as in the CPSEs, with a view to determine the inequitable distribution of benefits of reservation among the castes/communities included in the Centre List of Other Backward Classes.


    Keeping in view the voluminous data involved and the time required for its analysis to prepare a comprehensive report, the Commission had sought extension of its term by twelve weeks.
