    The above is to be implemented over a period of five years i.e. 2017-18 to 2021-22. In addition, 48,877 kms of projects under other ongoing schemes like NH(O), Special Accelerated Road Development Programme in North East (SARDP-NE), Externally Aided Projects (EAP) and Roads Projects in Left Wing Extremism Affected Areas (LWE) are also to be implemented during the same period.


    The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is empowered to apprise, approve and bid out all EPC projects under its purview within budgeted resources approved under Bharatmala Pariyojana Phase-I. Further, it is authorized to apprise and approve all PPP BOT (Toll) projects where no grant is given to the concessionaire and the construction and maintenance is financed by toll revenue. For, all other PPP projects i.e on BOT (annuity) and Hybrid Annuity (HAM) costing up to Rs.2,000 crore (TPC excluding land cost) the appraisal will be done by the Standing Finance Committee (SFC) and approval will be by Minister (RT&H). Further if cost of such projects exceeds Rs.2, 000 crore (TPC excluding land cost), the appraisal will be done by Public Private Partnership Appraisal Committee (PPPAC) and approval will be by Cabinet. In addition, all PPP projects which need VGF grants, those will be appraised and approved as per extant guidelines of Ministry of Finance applicable for VGF support.


    Detailed Projects Reports (DPR) for 24,800 km. is being prepared in phases by DPR consultants. DPR work for more than 9,000 km is complete and ready for bidding.


    It has been estimated that a total number of 4076 mandays are required for construction of one kilometer of highways. Accordingly, construction of 10,000 kms Highways annually has the potential to generate in excess of four crore mandays.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and C&F Shri Mansukh L Mandaviya in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
