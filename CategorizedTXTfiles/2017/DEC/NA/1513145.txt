    The situation of shortage of medicines and gap in the distribution of the medicines from Central Ware House (CWH) of Bureau of Pharma PSUs of India (BPPI) (the implementing agency of PMBJP) to PMBJP Kendras has been improved and as on 13.12.2017, the Minister informed.


    647 medicines and 129 surgical & consumables are available in CWH for sale covering 23 major therapeutic groups. BPPI has also initiated end to end supply solution to supply the medicines and other PMBJP products directly to PMBJP Kendras from CWH to reduce the time and cost. This will improve the supply position further, Shri Mandaviya informed.

To increase the profitability of PMBJP Kendra owners, trade margins have been revised from 16% to 20% for retailers under the scheme.


    Incentives are provided to PMBJP Kendras run by private entrepreneurs/ pharmacists/ NGOs/ Charitable organizations that are linked with BPPI’s software will get incentive upto Rs. 2.5 lakhs. This will be given @ 15% of monthly sales subject to a ceiling of Rs. 10,000/ per month and in case of north eastern states, naxal affected areas and tribal areas, ceiling of Rs. 15,000/- per month upto a total limit of Rs. 2.5 lakhs.
