    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:


    1.1 Crude oil production by ONGC during September, 2017 was 1844.25 TMT which is 2.79% lower than the monthly target but 2.25% higher when compared with September, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-September, 2017 was 11301.99 TMT which is 1.43% lower than target for the period but 2.48% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production with respect to target are as under:


    Ø Offshore: Natural decline/increase in water cut from matured fields of Western Offshore. Gas Lift De-optimization, Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) failure, and minimum well monitoring/ less stimulation jobs due to severe monsoon in Western Offshore.


    Ø Onshore: Frequent power shut downs in Mehsana, Ahmedabad & Assam hampered lift operations, wells closed for cluster drilling/ rig movements in Assam.


    1.2 Crude oil production by OIL during September, 2017 was 276.79 TMT which is 9.88% lower than monthly target but 5.71% higher than production in September, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-September, 2017 was 1693.60 TMT which is 9.53% lower than target for the period but 5.53% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


    Ø Less than planned contribution from old wells – rise in water cut in wells and decline in total liquid production of wells of Greater Hapjan and Greater Chandmari Fields.


    Ø Less than planned contribution from work over wells.


    1.3 Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during September, 2017 was 799.09 TMT which is 8.57% lower than the monthly target and 6.20% lower than September, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-September, 2017 was 5029.15 TMT which is 5.64% lower than target for the period and 7.38% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


    Ø RJ-ON-90/1 (CIL): Around 120 wells are closed either due to high water cut or require work over jobs. Poor reservoir performance of Bhagyam. Production stopped from Guda, Kaameshwari West, Raageshwari and Saraswati due to non-availability of tanker since July’17.


    Ø CY-ONN-2002/2 (ONGC): Test production from 5 oil wells. PML not yet granted.


    Natural Gas


    2. Natural gas production during September, 2017 was 2723.24 MMSCM which is 5.58% lower than the target for the month but 4.74% higher when compared with September, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production during April-September, 2017 was 16412.90 MMSCM which is 5.42% lower than target for the period but 4.38% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II. Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of September, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April-September, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

    Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production


    2.1 Natural gas production by ONGC during September, 2017 was 1937.62 MMSCM which is 1.95% lower than the monthly target but 5.20% higher when compared with September, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC during April-September, 2017 was 11675.24 MMSCM which is 1.56% lower than the cumulative target but 9.28% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


    Ø Offshore: Delay in commencement of production from well S-AC due to complications during well completion & hook-up in Eastern Offshore.


    Ø Onshore: Less off-take by power plants due to grid restrictions & trippings. Concurrent Planned shutdown of ADB-GCS and OTPC plant in Tripura


    2.2 Natural gas production by OIL during September, 2017 was 246.05 MMSCM which is 4.05% lower than the monthly target but 1.05% higher than September, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-September, 2017 was 1481.26 MMSCM which is 3.16% lower than the cumulative target but 0.47% higher than the production during the corresponding period of last year. The major reason for shortfall in production was inability of customers to offtake gas from time to time due to plant breakdown at customer end and shut down of few non-associated Gas well at various instances due to environmental problem.


    2.3 Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during September, 2017 was 539.57 MMSCM which is 17.18% lower than the monthly target but 4.83% higher when compared with September, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-September, 2017 was 3256.40 MMSCM which is 17.84% lower than the cumulative target and 8.67% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


    Ø Underperformance of wells in KG- OSN-2001/3 (GSPC)


    Ø Sohagpur West (RIL): Underperformance of CBM wells.


    Ø Raniganj East (Essar): Few wells closed for planned maintenance and refrac jobs


    Ø AAP-ON-94/1 (HOEC): Production deferred due to delay in grant of PML. Production commenced from 26 th Aug’17.


    3. Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)


    Refinery production during September, 2017 was 20480.58 TMT which is 3.45% higher than the target for the month and 3.87% higher when compared with September, 2016. Cumulative production during April-September, 2017 was 122386.55 TMT which is 3.95% higher than the target for the period and 0.73% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III. Company-wise production for the month of September, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April-September, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

    3.1 CPSE Refineries’ production during September, 2017 was 11290.71 TMT which is 0.98% higher than the target for the month and 4.85% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-September, 2017 was 70169.79 TMT which is 5.91% higher than the target for the period and 4.16% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


    Ø IOCL, Barauni: Throughput is lower than plan due to AVU-3 interruption and restricted crude processing due to HSD containment.


    Ø IOCL, Gujarat: Throughput is lower due to lower NG Crude receipt


    Ø IOCL Mathura: Throughput is lower due to deferment of planned shutdown from Aug-Sep'17 to Sep'17.


    Ø IOCL Panipat: Throughput is lower due to 1 day AVU interruption in Sep'17.


    Ø HPCL Mumbai: Unplanned shutdown of LR VPS


    Ø CPCL CBR: Throughput lower due to product upliftment constraints


    3.2 Production in JV refineries during September, 2017 was 1620.80 TMT which is 42.43% higher than the target for the month and 14.39% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-September, 2017 was 6485.49 TMT which is 0.44% lower than the target for the period and 26.09% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year.


    3.3 Production in private refineries during September, 2017 was 7569.07 TMT which is 1.21% higher than the target for the month and 0.49% higher when compared with September, 2016. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-September, 2017 was 45731.28 TMT which is 1.68% higher than the target for the period and 0.82% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year.


    3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of September, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April-September, 2017 vis-à-vis April-September, 2016 are given at Annexures - IV and V respectively.
