        The Quick Estimates of Index of Industrial Production (IIP) with base 2011-12 for the month of August 2017 have been released by the Central Statistics Office of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. IIP is compiled using data received from 14 source agencies viz. (i) Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP); (ii) Indian Bureau of Mines; (iii) Central Electricity Authority; (iv) Joint Plant Committee, Ministry of Steel; (v) Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas; (vi) Office of Textile Commissioner; (vii) Department of Chemicals & Petrochemicals; (viii) Directorate of Sugar & Vegetable Oils; (ix) Department of Fertilizers; (x) Tea Board; (xi) Office of Jute Commissioner; (xii) Office of Coal Controller; (xiii) Railway Board; and (xiv) Coffee Board.


        2. The General Index for the month of August 2017 stands at 121.5, which is 4.3 percent higher as compared to the level in the month of August 2016. The cumulative growth for the period April-August 2017 over the corresponding period of the previous year stands at 2.2 percent.


        3.
