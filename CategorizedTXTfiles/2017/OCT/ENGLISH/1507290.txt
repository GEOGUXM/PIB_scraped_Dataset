    It has come to the notice of the Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) and the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas that a large number of LPG consumers have complained about non-credit of the LPG subsidy amounts in to their bank accounts during the past few weeks.


    On verification, it is found that these complaints mainly pertain to those LPG consumers who are Airtel customers and have opened account in Airtel payment bank. Airtel is a telecom service provider which has also ventured into the Payment bank services in recent months.


    It is clarified that the LPG subsidy of these Airtel costumers has already been credited to their newly opened Airtel payment bank account seeded with Aadhaar.


    It may be noted that as per subsidy transfer protocol, the LPG subsidy is transferred to the (latest) bank account of the beneficiary seeded with their Aadhaar .


    To redress the inconvenience caused to LPG consumers, MoPNG and OMCs have already taken up the matter with the concerned authorities in Department of Financial Services (Ministry of Finance), National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and Airtel.
