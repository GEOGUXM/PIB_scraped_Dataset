      Posted On: 01 OCT 2017 5:25PM by PIB Delhi


    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind has issued the following message to the nation on the eve of Gandhi Jayanti.


    In his message the President has said, “Gandhi Jayanti is an occasion for all of us to rededicate ourselves to the ideals and values of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi.


    A man of simple living and a moral preceptor, Gandhiji gave a new direction to the country through his leadership. His philosophy of non-violence and peaceful co-existence is of increasing relevance in the present times. Through the symbols of Charkha, the spinning wheel and khadi, he stressed the message of self-reliance and dignity of labour.


    Cleanliness is not only the responsibility of sanitation personnel and Government Departments. Today, India is fighting a decisive battle for cleanliness and hygiene through the ‘Swachhta Hi Seva’ campaign. Gandhiji believed that ‘Cleanliness is next to Godliness’. He visualised cleanliness as having three dimensions- a clean mind, a clean body and clean surroundings. Let us also commit ourselves to ensuring public hygiene, personal hygiene and environmental hygiene.


    It is a multi-stakeholder national movement. Achieving the goals of the Swachh Bharat Mission expeditiously will be a true expression of tribute and regard to Gandhiji on his birth anniversary.”
