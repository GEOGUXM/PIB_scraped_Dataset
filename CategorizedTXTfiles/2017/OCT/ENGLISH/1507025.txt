With a view to improve supervision, Ministry of Railways has decided to increase number of posts of Additional Divisional Railway Managers (ADRMs) in all the railway division offices. In most of the cases, the post will increase from existing 01 post to 02 posts. In important divisions like Delhi, the number of posts of ADRMs will increase to 03 posts in place of existing 02. In case of two divisions in Mumbai, in Western & Central Railways, the number of ADRM posts will increase to 04 from the existing 02 post- one post of ADRM in each of the two Mumbai Divisions will be exclusively for handling suburban services.

In order to improve the functioning of Railways, substantial financial and administrative powers covering a wide spectrum of working have been delegated by the Indian Railways to General Managers (GM),Divisional Railway Managers (DRM) and field officials.

GMs have been given full powers to sanction out of turn safety related workswithout any ceiling, within the financial limit set out by Ministry of Finance. DRMs /Chief Workshop Managers (CWMs) have been given powers to re-engage retired railway employees up to 62 years of age against vacancies. This will take care of safety and maintenance related works wherever there are vacancies. Enhanced powers for repairs of Track Machines have also been given to the field officers for faster track safety work. Further, procedures have been substantially simplified for procurement of material like spare parts for locomotives, coaches etc.

Powers have been given to DRMs for repair of computers, printers and other equipment for Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS)/Passenger Reservation System (PRS), up to Rs 50 lakhs per case, to reduce passenger inconvenience in case of a break down. Further, they have been fully empowered for hiring of space for opening of UTS/PRS at non-rail head terminals. This will hugely benefit passengers in remote areas for booking tickets.

A model Schedule of Power (SOP) covering the best practices of all zonal railways is also under preparation and would be released shortly. The model SOP would serve as a guiding document and minimum benchmark for delegations of powers by GMs to DRMs and field units. However, this would not restrict GMs from further delegating powers and in fact, would encourage them to adapt as per local requirements.
