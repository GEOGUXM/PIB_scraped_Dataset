        1. Mountaineering activities form an essential ingredient for developing self-reliance and confidence. Such activities inculcate qualities like confidence, camaraderie, mental robustness, physical fitness and the ability to take decisions in the face of adversities.


        2. In continuance to the revered tradition of the Army Ordnance Corps, a ‘Trekking Expedition to Traill’s Pass’ was organized by AOC Centre, Secunderabad, under the aegis of Southern Command in September 2017.

It is considered to be one of the most venerated as well as challenging trekking expedition in the Indian Himalayas.
