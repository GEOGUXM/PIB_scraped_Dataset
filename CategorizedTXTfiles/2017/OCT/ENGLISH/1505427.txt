        The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, presented the Vayoshreshtha Samman â€“ a scheme of National Awards for senior citizens today (October 9, 2017) at a function held in New Delhi.


        Speaking on the occasion, the President said that there is a healthy tradition of respecting and taking care of elders in our country. He added according to the last census, the population of senior citizens in our country was approximately 10.5 crore, which was about 8.5% of our total population. The average life expectancy has increased in recent decades due to improvement in health services and other reasons. It is estimated that by the year 2050, the number of senior citizens will be approximately 19% of our total population.
