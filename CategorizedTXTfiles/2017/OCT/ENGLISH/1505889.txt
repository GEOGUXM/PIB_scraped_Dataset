        The first day of the 48th Conference of Governors/Lt Governors at Rashtrapati Bhavan concluded today (October 12, 2017) with presentations and a discussion on the themes of ‘Higher Education in States’ and ‘Skill Development and Entrepreneurship - Making Youth Employable’. The Minister of HRD, Shri Prakash Javadekar, and Minister of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, made presentations covering the vision and roadmap for addressing the issues on the agenda. Governors also gave their feedback and views, and cited experiences from their States.


        The agenda of the Conference has been shaped by the over-arching national mission to achieve ‘New India-2022’. India will complete 75 years of Independence in 2022. The Union Government has developed a vision for ‘New India-2022’ that will require initiatives in education and skill building, enhancing educational, health and sanitation capacities of citizens, and upgrading infrastructure. Also envisaged is better access to and quality of public services.


        Twenty-seven Governors and three Lt. Governors of States and Union Territories are participating in the Conference. The Administrators of the UTs of Dadra and Nagar Haveli & Daman and Diu as well as of Lakshadweep are special invitees. The Vice-President, the Prime Minister, Minister for Home Affairs and other Union Ministers also participated in the Conference today.


        Earlier in the day, in his opening remarks at the Conference, President Ram Nath Kovind said that it is essential to link youth with the process of nation building. Special attention needs to be paid to higher education and skill development at the level of States. Addressing the participants, the President emphasised the need to trust citizens. He gave the examples of self-attestation of documents by individuals and the easier mechanism for obtaining a passport that is in place now, urging States to take forward this philosophy of trusting the citizen.


        The President said that in the context of development of each part of the country, it was crucial to have a special focus on tribal and indigenous communities in the Fifth and Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. The President said the dream of a developed India will be realised only when every State develops.


        Following the President, the Doyen of Governors or the senior most Governor at the Conference, Shri E.S.L. Narasimhan, Governor of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, spoke on the gamut of developmental challenges, ranging from energy and technology to health and sustainable development.


        The first session was addressed by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. Referring to the mission of achieving New India by 2022, the Prime Minister emphasised that this can be achieved only with widespread popular participation. He said that it is important to encourage innovation not just in terms of new technology but also finding solutions to long-standing problems. He encouraged Governors to interact at length with students and teachers. He said universities should be centres of innovation. He suggested Governors could encourage their States and especially the youth and the university network to adopt one sport (other than cricket) in which the State had potential and attempt to build excellence in it.


        A presentation was made by Dr. Rajiv Kumar, Vice-Chairman of Niti Aayog on the elements of New India-2022. He said that the focus would be on a clean, healthy and safe India, with new benchmarks of governance, greater transparency and higher accountability.
