The index for 'Manufacture of Textiles' group rose by 0.6 percent to 113.4 (provisional) from 112.7 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of texturised and twisted yarn (2%) and weaving & finishing of textiles, manufacture of cordage, rope, twine & netting and cotton yarn (1% each). However, the price of viscose yarn (3%) and manufacture of knitted and crocheted fabrics (2%) declined.

The index for 'Manufacture of Wood and of Products of Wood and Cork ' group rose by 0.2 percent to 132.4 (provisional) from 132.1 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of wooden block - compressed or not (2%) and plywood block boards and wooden box/crate (1% each). However, the price of timber/wooden plank, sawn/resawn and wood cutting, processed/sized (1% each) declined.

The index for 'Manufacture of Paper and Paper Products' group rose by 0.7 percent to 119.3 (provisional) from 118.5 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of tissue paper (8%), corrugated sheet box (4%), paper bag including craft paper bag (3%), card board box, hard board and poster paper (2% each) and paper for printing & writing and newsprint (1% each). However, the price of corrugated paper board (4%) and duplex paper, laminated plastic sheet, paper carton/box and map litho paper (1% each) declined.

However, the price of wooden furniture (2%) declined.
