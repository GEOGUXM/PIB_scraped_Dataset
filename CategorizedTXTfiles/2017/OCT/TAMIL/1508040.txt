      Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman released a coffee table book on the Department of Defence Production (DDP), titled ‘A journey towards self-reliance’ here today. The first ever coffee table book on the department, it chronicles the post-independence years of development, indigenisation and production of arms, ammunition and defence equipment, with a view to achieve self-reliance for the Armed Forces of India.
      Smt Nirmala Sitharaman, in her message printed in the book says, “The coffee table book is a noteworthy initiative of DDP to compile success stories of projects of OFB/ DPSUs, transcending from the stage of inception to execution.”
      A similar view is echoed by Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr. Subhash Bhamre who in his message says, “I am pleased to learn that DDP is bringing out a “Coffee Table Book” highlighting inception of OFB/ DPSUs, production of wide ranging products at various units, indigenization efforts as well as the Corporate Social Responsibilities.”
      The contents of the book are a remarkable collection of past and current defence equipment produced in India. Avid readers will find themselves immersed in a world of illustrations and remarkable photographs, captured at ‘the’ moments, and revealing relevant texts, which will be of interest to the ‘defence technology-savvy’ Indians.
      The book epitomises the visionary approach of the Government of India seeking to establish India as a global manufacturing hub, under the ‘Make in India’ initiative. It lends credence to the sincere efforts put in by thousands of unknown faces, to mould and shape the Indian defence industry.
