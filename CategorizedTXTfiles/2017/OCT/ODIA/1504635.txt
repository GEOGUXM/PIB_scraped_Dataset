    Headquarters Integrated Defence Staff (HQ IDS) celebrated its 17th Raising Day today. To commemorate the momentous occasion, Chief of the IDS to the Chairman Chiefs of Staff Committee (CISC) Lt General Satish Dua paid homage to the valiant martyrs of the Armed Forces by laying a wreath at ‘Amar Jawan Jyoti’, India Gate in New Delhi. Senior officers of the Army, Navy and Air Force of the IDS were present on the occasion. A Tri Services guard was in accompaniment.
    
    Conveying his best wishes on the occasion, Lt General Dua complimented all ranks of the IDS for their commitment and selfless service and exhorted them to maintain the highest standards of professional integrity and excellence in the years to come.
    
    It may be noted that the Government had taken a decision in October 2001 to create the HQ IDS in the aftermath of ‘Operation Vijay’ (Kargil Operations). The main objective was to promote synergy among the three Services and to integrate these with the Ministry of Defence. The overarching aim of IDS is to achieve ‘Victory through Jointness’. The IDS has taken significant strides towards achieving this objective.
