    Shri Piyush Goyal, Union Minister of Coal & Railways, much to the joy of around 3 Lakh non-executive employees of Coal India Limited and its subsidiaries, today, i.e. 13 th October, 2017 announced that the one-time advance payable to each employee would now be Rs. 51,000 instead of Rs. 40,000, before Diwali by 17 th October – the day of Dhanteras.


    Shri Goyal’s generous gesture was hailed by the trade unions and brought new-found optimism among the coal workers furthering their Diwali cheer. The one-time advance would be paid to the employees currently on the rolls of the company.


    The Union Coal Minister complimented the employees of CIL for their diligence and perseverance for achieving 10.1% growth in coal production for September 2017 and 13% growth in October 2017 so far. He exhorted the employees to continue on the same path and break all the previous records.


    Shri Goyal enthused the coal workers by stating that it was heartening to note that the growth in coal dispatch to power sector moved into high orbit with 21% in September 2017 and around 22% till 12th October. He extended happy and prosperous Diwali greetings to all the employees.


    It may be recalled the year-long wage negotiations were concluded between CIL Management and Trade Union representatives much to the satisfaction of the employees and management who received a 20% increase on wages.


    The main thrust of the wage negotiation was to make available ‘reliable and affordable power to all’ and social security for workers.
