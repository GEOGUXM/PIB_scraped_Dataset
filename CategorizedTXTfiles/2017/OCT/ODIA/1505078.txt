    National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has so far planted about 10 lakh plants along national highways in this monsoon season. This includes about 4 lakh avenue plants and about 6 lakh plants on the highway medians. The plantation drive is part of NHAIâ€™s activity towards ensuring and upholding the cause of Swachh Bharat Mission in providing clean, green and pollution free National Highways. The drive is taken up as a regular activity during monsoons and continues even afterwards with watering and maintenance of the plants. Plantation work has been mainstreamed as an integral part of highway development projects, thereby ensuring that our highways remain clean, green and pollution free.
