    Soldiers and officers of various army and para-military units like CRPF, BSF, BRO, ITBP, etc. are deployed in remote and far flung areas to protect Borders of India. The soldiers and officers are working day and night without bothering about difficult weather conditions and as they are posted away from their homes and headquarters, there is a constant requirement for them to speak to their family and also to their Headquarters. They use only DSPT service provided by BSNL because there is no other means of communications available in those areas.


    Briefing the media here, the Minister of Communications Shri Manoj Sinha said that in order to use the facility of DSPT, the soldiers & officers at present are required to pay monthly fee of Rs.500/- and call charges of Rs.5/- per minute. But, looking at the requirement of Soldiers & Officers and also the heavy cost they have to incur for talking to their family members, government has taken an important decision on the auspicious occasion of Diwali. Shri Sinha said, from Diwali day (19th October, 2017), no monthly fee will be taken for using DSPT service, that is, the current monthly fee of Rs.500/- will be ‘Zero’ from tomorrow. And also, the present telephone charges of Rs.5/- per minute is being reduced to Re.1/- per minute.


    With this special Diwali Gift from Government of India, Defence personnel can now talk without worrying for more expenses to their home and their Headquarter. The Minister also wished the jawans and officers and their family members A Very Happy Diwali.
