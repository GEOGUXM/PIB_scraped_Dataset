    In a very sad accident on 6 October 2017, one MI-17V5 crashed near Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh. The accident occurred in high altitude area while the helicopter was undertaking maintenance sortie. The post is not connected by any road.
    
    Immediately seeing the accident, all soldiers of the post commenced the recovery effort in the treacherous terrain. As the helicopter had caught fire, the recovery was difficult. On 06 October, the mortal remains of the crew and the soldiers who died in the helicopter crash were collected from the wreckage and were promptly moved to the nearest helipad.
    
    Due to constraints of the carriage effort in high altitude area, helicopter cannot carry full load. Mortal remains were wrapped in available local resources instead of improvised body bags or coffins. This was an aberration.
    
    Mortal remains arrived at Guwahati Base Hospital by 2P.M. on 6 October and thereafter post-mortems and other formalities commenced.
    
    Immediately after the post-mortem, all the mortal remains were placed in the wooden coffins with full military honours. Consequent to paying of tributes as per full military honours, mortal remains of all the personnel have been sent to respective next of kin.
    
    Carriage of mortal remains, wrapped in local resources as in this case, is an aberration. Body bags, wooden boxes will be ensured.
    
    Armed Forces always ensure full military honour to the fallen comrades.
