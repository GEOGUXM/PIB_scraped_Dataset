    The current Indian Military Advisory and Training Team has been deployed at the Senior Command and Staff College (SCSC) in Jinja, Uganda since April 2016. Their contributions to the curriculum revision, student assimilation enhancement and capability building of the local directing staff have been appreciated by no less than the President of Uganda. The team, through its rapport and positive interaction, has been successful in mobilising the local Indian community in provisioning a state of art gymnasium to the SCSC. With equipment that’s been imported from Dubai, the gymnasium’s net worth is more than $30,000 US. It was inaugurated by the High Commissioner of India to Uganda, His Excellency Sh Ravi Shankar and then handed over to the Chief of Defence Forces of the Uganda People’s Defence Forces (UPDF), Gen David Muhoozi, who while graciously accepting the same, hailed it as a ‘one of kind asset for the entire UPDF’. He thanked the Indian contingent for the focused dedication towards the betterment of the UPDF which he felt was contributing immensely towards the development and consolidation of Indo-Uganda relations.
