    Indian Air Force, established on 08 Oct 1932, will be celebrating its 85th Anniversary on 08 Oct 2017. Headquarters Southern Air Command based in Thiruvananthapuram will also celebrate the anniversary of IAF in its traditional way.


    To commemorate the occasion, various programmes will be held for serving and retired Air Force Personnel and their families. The reunion will provide an opportunity for the retired personnel to revisit old memories and share their experience with the generation in command now.


    On the occasion of the Air Force Day, Air Marshal RKS Bhadauria, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Southern Air Command will administer the oath of allegiance to all the serving air warriors as well as civilian personnel of Southern Air Command for dedicating their lives to longer and much greater cause of the nation.


    In addition to the mandated functions of protection of the Indian airspace and conduct of operational tasks, IAF has been proactive in assisting the civil populace when the need arises. In the southern peninsula, humanitarian assistance in disaster relief during Chennai floods, rescue operations during Puttingal Temple (Kollam) fire tragedy and firefighting operations to put down the forest fire at Mukkunnimala are a few recent examples of active involvement and timely support to the local populace.
