      Posted On: 12 OCT 2017 6:37PM by PIB Thiruvananthpuram


    A Coastguard Dornier Aircraft from Kochi on routine sortie in the morning on 12 Oct. 17 received a radio message from fishing boat St Mary about damage to another fishing boat Emmanuel. The boat with about 06 crew members was sinking. Two crew members were rescued by another boat Govind in the vicinity. The CG Dornier aircraft established communication with fishing boat Govind and located the sinking fishing boat about 46 nautical miles from Beypore. Extensive search was undertaken 40 nm around the boat by the aircraft.


    Meanwhile Coast Guard deployed its vessel CG 404 from Beypore for search and rescue of the other missing crew. The vessel after a day long search could not locate any more survivors. The vessel along with the two rescued survivors and another medical casualty from fishing boat Govind is heading back to Beypore, while another CG vessel Aryamaan is being deployed to continue the search for the remaining missing crew.


    The search would continue tomorrow with another aircraft and ship being deployed for the purpose from Kochi
