    Rashtriya Ekta Diwas (National Unity Day) was observed by Southern Naval Command, Kochi on 31 Oct 17 to reaffirm in naval personnel, the inherent strength and resilience of our nation to withstand the potential threats to the unity, integrity and security of our country. All personnel including civilians from various ships, units and establishments of the Command took the Rashtriya Ekta Diwas Pledge on the solemn occasion, in which they pledged to “dedicate themselves to preserve the unity, integrity and security of the nation and also strive hard to spread this message among fellow countrymen in the spirit of unification of the country, which was made possible by the vision and actions of late Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel”.


    Rashtriya Ekta Diwas was introduced by the Government of India in 2014 to pay tribute to Vallabhbhai Patel, who was instrumental in keeping India united post-Independence. It is celebrated on 31 Oct every year in commemoration of the birthday of the Iron Man of India.
