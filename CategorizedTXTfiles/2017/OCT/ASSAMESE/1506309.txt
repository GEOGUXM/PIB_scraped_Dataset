      The Department of Paediatric Surgery at Army Hospital (Research & Referral), New Delhi organised a module on “ Continuing Medical Education on Minimally Invasive Surgery in Children – Current trends and future perspectives” on 14 th & 15 th October 2017.


      Senior faculty from institutes of excellence across the country, including the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and PGI Chandigarh participated in the academic deliberations which put the various issues related to the topic in perspective and charted the way forward.


      The chief guest, Lt Gen MK Unni , the Director General Armed Forces Medical Services said that medical knowledge is always in a state of flux, especially with continuous addition of newer research and technologies. Striking a balance between an old and established method and a newer technique claiming superior outcomes requires constant deliberation on the part of surgeons.


      Lt Gen Bipin Puri, Director General Medical Services (Army), an acclaimed Paediatric surgeon himself, highlighted the complexity of minimally invasive surgery in children in view of the smaller operating field and greater dexterity involved in performance of the procedure. He had recently inaugurated the medical stores module of Dhanvantri, the first of its kind medical stores inventory management software at Command Hospital Chandimandir. The aim of this module is to streamline the management of medical store inventory.
