She said in her recorded video on ANI released on Twitter @ANI and @DDNewsLive that people especially in the states of Bihar and Jharkhand must come forward to provide information about the Parents of Geeta alias Guddi if they know of someone who lost their girl child some ten or twelve years ago and could be Geetaâ€™s parents.
