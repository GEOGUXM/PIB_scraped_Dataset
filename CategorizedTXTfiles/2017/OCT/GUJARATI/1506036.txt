    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today spoke at the closing session of the Conference of Governors at Rashtrapati Bhawan.
    
    The Prime Minister thanked the Governors for the various inputs given during the course of the Conference.
    
    The Prime Minister said that India does not lack in ideas, resources and capabilities, but certain States and regions have lagged behind due to a governance deficit. He said various government schemes for the benefit of the poor, are better implemented in areas where good governance exists. Giving examples of schemes such as Mission Indradhanush, he said Governors can facilitate greater effectiveness of government initiatives.
    
    In order to strengthen the unity and integrity of India, the Prime Minister urged Governors to involve themselves in initiatives such as Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat; and Run For Unity.
