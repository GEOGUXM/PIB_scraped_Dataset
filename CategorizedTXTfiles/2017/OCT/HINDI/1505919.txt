    The newly appointed Governor of Meghalaya, Shri Ganga Prasad called on the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today and exchanged inputs about various aspects of the political and administrative scenario in the State.
    
    Dr Jitendra Singh informed the Governor that the Ministry of DoNER has decided to fund the upgradation of Air strip at Shillong Airport.
    
    The North Eastern Council (NEC), Dr Jitendra Singh said, which was set up in the early 1970s, long before an exclusive Ministry for the Northeast Region was established, also has its headquarters in Shillong. He said the Ministry had now started an extensive exercise to reorient and rejuvenate the NEC in a new format so that it could perform the effective role of an important resource-cum-research centre for the entire region and could be developed as the hub of innovation for the upliftment of entire Northeast. A proposal in this regard, he said, has already been circulated and is presently under the active consideration of the Government of India.
    
    Dr Jitendra Singh said it goes to the credit of the Union Government that States like Meghalaya, which had never seen a train, are now soon going to be on the rail map of India. He said the priority accorded by the present government to the Northeast is evident from the fact that Shri Narendra Modi is the first Prime Minister after about 40 years who visited Shillong for the Plenary Meeting of the NEC.
