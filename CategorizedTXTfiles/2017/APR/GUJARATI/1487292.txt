    In the backdrop of several initiatives by the Government of India to promote affordable housing for Economically Weaker Sections, Low and Middle Income Groups including sanction of ‘infrastructure status’ for this segment, CREDAI (Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India) today launched 352 projects in 53 cities in 17 States across the country with an investment of Rs.38,003 cr to build 2,03,851 affordable houses.


    These housing projects to be taken up the members of CREDAI across the country in the first major private investments into affordable housing were today launched by the Minister of Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation Shri M.Venkaiah Naidu at Gandhinagar.


    Ministry of HUPA has so far approved construction of 17,73,052 affordable houses under Prime Minister’s Awas Yojana (Urban) with an investment of Rs.95,660 cr in 30 States and Union Territories. These approved projects are to be executed with assistance from central and state governments and beneficiary contribution under the four components of PMAY (Urban). Under this urban housing mission, central assistance in the range of Rs.1.00 lakh to Rs.2.35 lakh will be provided to each beneficiary. PMAY (Urban) was launched by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on June 25, 2015.


    The Government of India on December 31, 2017 extended the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme component of PMAY (Urban) to Middle Income Groups with annual incomes in the range of Rs.12 lakh to Rs.18 lakh under which interest subsidy of 4% and 3% on housing loans will be provided. With this, beneficiaries belonging to EWS, LIG and MIG with annual incomes up to Rs.18 lakh have been brought under the ambit of PMAY (Urban) opening up substantial investment opportunities for developers both at the bottom and middle of the pyramid.


    Speaking on the occasion, Shri Venkaiah Naidu complimented CREDAI and its members for coming forward to invest in affordable housing projects and assured them that his Ministry and Central Nodal Agencies like the National Housing Bank and HUDCO will extend full cooperation in reaching the benefits prescribed under PMAY (Urban) to the beneficiaries who join the projects launched today.


    Details of affordable housing projects launched today for implementation are:
