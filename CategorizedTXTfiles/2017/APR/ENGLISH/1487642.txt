    The Agricultural and Processed Food Export Development Authority (APEDA), an autonomous organisation under the Department of Commerce, under its 12 th Plan Central Sector Scheme titled “Agriculture Export Promotion Plan Scheme of APEDA” has been providing assistance to the exporters of the agricultural and processed food products under the various components of the scheme viz. Infrastructure Development, Market Promotion, Quality Development and Transport Assistance. Moreover, the exporters of the agricultural and processed food products have also been getting assistance under various export promotion schemes of the Department of Commerce viz. Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme, Market Development Assistance (MDA) Scheme and Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS).


    The export promotion schemes are primarily aimed at assisting exporters of agricultural and processed food products and creating export oriented infrastructure for such products. Benefits derived by the small and marginal farmers from such schemes would be indirect in nature and hence cannot be assessed.

APEDA has provided financial assistance to various agencies of the Government of Rajasthan for setting up common infrastructure facilities for exports as under:
