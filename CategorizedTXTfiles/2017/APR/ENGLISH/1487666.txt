    The Budget Session 2017 has been historic in many ways, said Shri Ananth kumar, Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs and Chemicals & fertilizers, while addressing the media here today. The Minister informed that the Budget Session, 2017 of Parliament which commenced on Tuesday, 31st January, 2017 has been adjourned sine die today ie. Wednesday, the 12th April, 2017.


    Shri Ananth kumar noted that three main highlights of the Budget Session, 2017, that are historic achievements are


    · Preponing of the Union Budget and completion of all financial business of Government before the start of next financial year by 31 st March;


    · Passing of all the enabling acts of the Goods & Services Tax (GST);


    · Presenting and passing of an Integrated Budget.


    This has been possible due to the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Shri ArunJaitley along with the participation of all members of both Houses of Parliament in constructive debates held on various issues of public importance, the Minister added.


    Shri Ananth kumar informed that this is for the first time in Indian legislative history that all financial business of Government has been completed before the start of next financial year by 31 st March and that too without any short cuts by following due process of general discussion, scrutiny by Standing Committees, discussions on some individual Ministries etc. Whenever in the past financial business was completed before 31 st March, those were either election years having interim budgets or in other cases scrutiny by Parliamentary Committees was dispensed with. This is a big financial reform so as to make full funds available to line Ministries for execution of their developmental projects. This is the first time when Vote on Account was dispensed with during the Budget session.


    Speaking on the occasion Shri S.S. Ahluwalia, Minister of State for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare and Parliamentary Affairs, explained in detail about the advantages of preponing the Budget, merger of General and Railway Budgets, and how it will facilitate the efficient deployment of financial resources for carrying social development works.


    Minister of State for Minority Affairs (IC) and Parliamentary Affairs, Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi informed the media that the Government followed the policy of ‘Sampark, Samvaad, Samanvaya’ and ensuredthat all issues of wide public importance debated upon in depth by giving all members of both Houses a chance to present their views and derive a constructive consensus to move forward. He noted that 3 important bills namely,Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2017 for giving Constitutional status to the backward classes commission, Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2017 and Factories (Amendment) Bill, 2016, could not be passed by both Houses. Shri Naqvi said that the opposition to these bills was not on merit but still the Government respected the consensus in Rajya Sabha to refer them to the Select Committee. The Minister noted that the delay in passage of these socially important bills will prevent the common people to derive benefits for some more time.


    Regarding the Legislative Business carried out during the Budget Session 2017, it was informed that the first part of the Budget Session yielded a total of 7 sittings of Lok Sabha and 8 sittings of the Rajya Sabha. In the second part of the Session there were 22 sittings of Lok Sabha and 21 sittings of Rajya Sabha. During the entire Budget Session, 2017 there were in total 29 sittings each of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.The productivity of Lok Sabha was 113.27% and that of Rajya Sabha was 92.43%. Approximately 8 hours were lost in Lok Sabha and 18 hours in Rajya Sabha due to interruptions, which was made up by sitting late for approximately 19 hours and 7 hours respectively.


    This being the first Session of the year, the President addressed both Houses of Parliament assembled together in terms of Article 87(1) of the Constitution, on 31 st January, 2017 and informed the Parliament of the causes of its summons.
