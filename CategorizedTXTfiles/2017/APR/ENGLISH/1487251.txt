    As per the quarterly estimate released by the CSO, the growth rate in the real for the third quarter (October-December quarter) of 2016-17 was 7.0 per cent. The growth of GDP in the third quarter of 2016-17 was estimated to have been boosted by a 6 per cent growth in the real GVA in agriculture & allied sectors, which is higher than the corresponding growth rates of 1.9 per cent and 3.8 per cent respectively in the first and second quarters of the year. The growth rate in the real GVA of manufacturing in the third quarter of 2016-17 was 8.3 per cent, as compared the corresponding growth rates of 9.0 per cent and 6.9 per cent respectively in the first and second quarters of the year.


    As per the quarterly estimates brought out by the CSO, real GDP grew by 7.2 per cent and 7.4 per cent respectively in the first and second quarters of 2016-17. The real GDP growth was estimated to be 7.0 per cent in the third quarter of the year—the period during which the demonetisation of high denomination currencies occurred. On the basis of the estimates of national income for first three quarters of 2016-17 and the second advance estimates for 2016-17 by the CSO, the implied growth of real GDP for the fourth quarter would be robust at 7.0 per cent.
