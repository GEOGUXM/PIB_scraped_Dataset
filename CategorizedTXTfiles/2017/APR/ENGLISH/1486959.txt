      Amount earmarked for North Eastern States
      Posted On: 06 APR 2017 4:21PM by PIB Delhi


    All the Ministries/Departments (except those specifically exempted by Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region) are required to spend 10% of their annual Gross Budgetary Support (GBS) from their allocations under various schemes for the benefit of North Eastern Region.


    The Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region compiles expenditure figures from non-exempted Ministries/Departments on annual basis. The allocation and actual expenditure figures in respect of these Ministries/Departments are forwarded to Ministry of Finance for vetting.


    The Ministry-wise lump-sum allocation to the North Eastern Region is made through the Union Budget. While some schemes have State-wise allocation, others are sectoral. Through a system of continuous monitoring, review and follow-up, all attempts are made to ensure that the amount allocated to the State under the NLCPR Scheme of this Ministry is spent by the State Government.


    This was stated by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question by Shri Ram Nath Thakur in the Rajya Sabha today.
