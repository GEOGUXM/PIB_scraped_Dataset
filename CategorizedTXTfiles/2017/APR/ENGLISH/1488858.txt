    India is hosting FIFA Under – 19 World Cup in October this year. The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has called for the support of not only children, but also parents to encourage boys and girls to play football and develop both skill and fitness. The tournament will be a milestone event in many ways, but perhaps most lasting aspect will be Mission XI Million, which is a grassroot programme designed to encourage children to play this popular game.


    ​Keeping in view of the appeal of the Prime Minister, the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) have been tasked to conduct ‘Oorja’, - CAPFs Under-19 Football Talent Hunt Tournament – 2017. CAPFs will be jointly organizing the tournament under the aegis of All India Police Sports Control Board throughout the country from May 1-15, 2017. The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) is tasked to conduct the tournament for the States of Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Goa and the Union Territories of Dadr​a​ & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu.


    In Goa, CISF is organizing the​ ​Oorja – 2017 for Boys and Girls under the age of 19 from May 1-10, 2017. O​pening Ceremony​ is ​ scheduled on May 1, 2017 at Bambolim Football stadium, Goa in which Governor of Goa, Smt. Mridula Sinha will be the Chief Guest. Chief Minister Shri Manohar Parrikar will grace the Closing Ceremony scheduled on May 10, 2017. Bruno Coutinho, Arjuna Awardee, will be the brand ambassador for Oorja -2017, in Goa.


    Mission XI Million is a school contact programme that aims at improving the football ecosystem and ultimately widening the talent pool for the national team. Vying to reach out to over 37 cities and 12,000 schools across all 29 states of India, the initiative will focus on games that can be adapted to different field sizes and conditions, with special emphasis on small-sided games. It is divided into three phases: seminars for teacher and educators, in-school activities and football festivals, which will run up to September, 2017.
