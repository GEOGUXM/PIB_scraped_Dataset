    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the valedictory ceremony of the Sesquicentennial Celebrations of the Allahabad High Court.
    
    Speaking on the occasion, he said the Allahabad High Court is like a place of pilgrimage for our judiciary. He said those associated with the legal profession also played a vital role in our freedom struggle, and protected our people against colonialism.
    
    He urged people to think about the India we want to create when we mark 75 years of freedom in 2022. He said every citizen should prepare a roadmap towards it.
    
    The Prime Minister said that about 1200 obsolete laws have been scrapped by the Union Government since May 2014. He said technology is playing a key role in this century and there is a lot of scope for its use in the judiciary as well. He urged those involved in the startup sector to innovate on aspects where technology can help the judiciary.
