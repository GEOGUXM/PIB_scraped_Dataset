    Construction of ten roads (and some major bridges) of a total length of 433.225 Km under the North Eastern States Roads Investment Programme (NESRIP), an Asian Development Bank (ADB) assisted road project, is presently under implementation.


    The State Public Works Departments in the six states are the implementing agencies. In Assam, the work has been completed (Bilasipara to Fakirgram NH-31) and under the second project (Barpeta to Kalitakuchi) in Assam and (Garobadha to Dalu NH-51) in Meghalaya, more than 50% of the work has been completed. As for the remaining projects, progress is at different stages of construction ranging from 10% to 42%.


    Reason for delay are as under:


    1. Delay in land acquisition.


    2. Delay in utility shifting and tree cutting.


    Four roads under Tranche-I are likely to be completed by 30 th June, 2019 and the remaining roads by March 31, 2020.


    The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved loan of US$200 million for NESRIP, but release is on reimbursement basis after the submission of necessary documents. The withdrawal from ADB stands at US$25.75 million for Tranche-1 and US$20.28 million for Tranche-2 as on 31.3.2017.
