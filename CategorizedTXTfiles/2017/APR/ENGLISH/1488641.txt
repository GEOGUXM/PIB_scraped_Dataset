    The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee has extended his greetings and felicitations to the Government and people of the Republic of Togo on the eve of their National Day (April 27, 2017).


    In a message to His Excellency Mr. Faure Essozimna Gnassingbe, the President of the Republic of Togo, the President has said, “ It gives me great pleasure to extend warm greetings on behalf of the Government and people of India to you and to the Government and people of Republic of Togo on the occasion of your National Day.
