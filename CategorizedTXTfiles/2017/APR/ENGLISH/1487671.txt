      Central Security Agencies take cognizance of such incidences of international terror strikes and necessary security measures are taken to counter such terror attacks in India.
      
      Security of sensitive buildings in the capital including Parliament House, Supreme Court, High Courts, Govt. Buildings, Vital Installations and important monuments etc. is reviewed periodically.
      
      After the incident in London, the security agencies have been properly briefed to remain extra vigilant while performing duties and ensure proper security arrangements in the Parliament House Complex. Recently, instructions to strengthen the security of Government buildings under MHA security cover have also been issued on 31.03.2017.
      
      This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question by Dr. T.Subbarami Reddy and Smt. Ambika Soni in the Rajya Sabha today.
