    The objective of the programme is to operationalize SFPC on pilot basis in 3 districts viz. Ziro in Lower Subansiri District for large cardamom and Namsai in Namsai District for ginger in Arunachal Pradesh & West District in Sikkim for large cardamom for empowering the farmers, especially women farmers in the identified spices growing districts, for better price realization through post harvest management, primary processing, value addition, packing, aggregation, organic certification etc.
    
    Each SFPC will have 500 farmers as members in a sub-division or district. The farmers will be identified on cluster basis in a village, taluk or district by forming Farmer Interest Group(FIGs), each consisting of 20 farmers. 25 such FIGs will be formed to establish a SFPC.
