    The Centre for United Nations Peacekeeping (CUNPK) in India, is organising two week training at Manekshaw Centre in New Delhi from 03 April to 14 April 2017, in partnership with UN Women. A total of 41 participants from 27 different countries are attending the course to derive benefit from it and to be available to the United Nations for deployment in field areas. CUNPK is the pioneer institute to conduct this training and has continued training such officers since 2015.
    
    The training team consists of some of the most experienced and seasoned speakers from across the globe. Participation from all the continents including instructors, facilitators and evaluators has ensured balanced regional representation.
    
    India has also taken a lead in hosting specialized UN peacekeeping courses on Conflict related Sexual Violence (CRSV) at CUNPK in the past. Interestingly, India is one of the very few countries to have fielded an all Women Police battalion in a UN mission in Liberia, from 2007 to 2015.
