    India cherishes her rich and multi-faceted partnership with the United Kingdom. Our bilateral cooperation has been expanded and strengthened in recent years and our fruitful engagements and exchanges at the highest political levels have given us much to look forward to.
    
    The India-UK Year of Culture, launched by Your Majesty in London a few weeks ago makes this a particularly special year in the India-UK relationship. Your Majesty’s personal contribution and commitment to the enhancement of the friendship and mutually beneficial ties between India and the United Kingdom has been invaluable.
    
    Please accept, Your Majesty, our sincere wishes for your good health and well-being. I take this opportunity to also convey the greetings of the people of India to the friendly people of the United Kingdom on the occasion of ‘Queen’s Day’.”
