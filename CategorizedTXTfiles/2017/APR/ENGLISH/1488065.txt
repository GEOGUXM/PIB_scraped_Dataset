      The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee attended an event to commemorate the centenary of Mahatma Gandhi’s Champaran Satyagraha, at Patna today (April 17, 2017) where he honoured freedom fighters.
      
      Speaking on the occasion, the President said that we are today commemorating the hundred years of Champaran Satyagraha. Champaran in Bihar served as the laboratory of Satyagraha and National Freedom Movement. He said that the symbolic significance of Champaran Satyagraha was much greater than what actually happened in Champaran. Along with the Kheda Satyagraha of 1917-1918, the Champaran Satyagraha was the movement responsible for putting Gandhi on the front seat of the Indian nationalist movement and making satyagraha a powerful tool of civilian resistance.
      
      The President said that the Government of Bihar deserves appreciation for commemorating the centenary of the Champaran movement and for organising the event to felicitate the freedom fighters of India. It is a true homage to our roots – the freedom fighters, who under the able and inspiring leadership of Gandhiji laid the foundation of a resilient Indian freedom movement. The event is not only to recognize the contribution of our freedom fighters but was also important because it is necessary that we know our history and are acquainted with our roots. He said that we must celebrate our diversity and should make efforts to ensure that India reaches at rightful place in the comity of nations.
