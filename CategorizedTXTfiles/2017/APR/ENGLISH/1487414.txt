The process is entirely online and a continuous activity and all new subscribers including those who are left out are consistently urged by the Employeesâ€™ Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) through their respective employers to complete the uploading of their Aadhaar number to achieve complete linking of Aadhaar number with UAN.
