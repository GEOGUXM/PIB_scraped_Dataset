    Following is the text of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s message on Earth Day:


    “Earth Day is a day of gratitude to Mother Earth and a day to reiterate our firm resolve to keep our planet clean and green.


    It is our duty to live in harmony with the plants, animals and birds we share the Earth with. We owe this to our future generations.


    I hope this year’s theme of 'Environmental and Climate Literacy’ helps create awareness on protecting nature and natural resources.”
