      The Department of Consumer Affairs has collaborated with Google India on raising awareness about internet safety amongst Indian consumers. The proposed outcome of the campaign is to integrate the internet safety message into everyday tasks that the consumers undertake over the internet such as financial transactions, using e-mails, doing e-commerce or simply surfing the internet for information. Activities proposed under the campaign include training of selected VCOs, Government officials and counselors of National Consumer Helpline. Various awareness material pertaining to digital safety has been uploaded in the website of the Department. There is no financial implication on the part of the Department under the collaboration with Google India.
      
      There is already a National Consumer Helpline (1XXX-XX-4000 and short code 14404) where a consumer can lodge his grievance and get assistance.
      
      This information was given by Shri C.R. Chaudhary, the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
