      Posted On: 11 APR 2017 4:14PM by PIB Delhi

      
      Two additional Reserve Battalions have been sanctioned to CISF in June, 2016. Further, Government has recently (December, 2016) increased the ceiling of strength of CISF from 1,45,000 to 1,80,000. The requirement of manpower for expansion/new induction is met from this enhanced strength on need basis.
      
      CISF is deployed for security of Delhi Metro Rail only and not at any other Metro. At present there is no proposal for creation of a separate battalion of CISF for providing security at Metro rail stations.
      
      This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question by Shri Ram Charitra Nishad in the Lok Sabha today.
