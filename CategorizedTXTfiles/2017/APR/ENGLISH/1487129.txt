    As per the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, a total number of 44256, 42521 and 42088 women committed suicide during 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively, which shows a declining trend. The main reasons behind the committing of suicide by women are family problems, illness, marriage related issues such as Cancellation/Non-settlement of marriage, Dowry disputes, Extra marital affairs, love affairs, etc.
    
    Health being a State subject under List-II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, States are empowered to implement their own programmes. However, the Government of India attaches highest importance in the matter and is implementing the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) and District Mental Health Programme (DMHP) in some districts of the country with added components of suicide prevention services, work place stress management, life skills training and counselling in schools and colleges.
    
    This information was given by Minister of State for Women & Child Development, Smt Krishna Raj in reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
