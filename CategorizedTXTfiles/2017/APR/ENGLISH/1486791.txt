      Police is a State subject, hence State Govt. concerned is mandated to take measures to ensure protection of their police personnel. However, Govt. of India provides central assistance for procurement of various safety instruments/equipments including Anti-Riot Equipment, Full Body Protector, Bullet Resistant (BR) Jackets, Bullet Resistant (BR) Helmets, MSL, Tear Gas, PAVA Shells, Chilli Water Cannon under the scheme of Modernization of Police Force (MPF) as per their operational requirement and strategic priorities to the State police. Similar assistance is separately provided to the CAPF for safety instruments/equipments for their personnel. These personnel are also imparted requisite training and regular mock drills to deal with such situations effectively.
      
      Bureau of Police Research & Development, MHA, report “Précis on Crowd Control” exhaustively dealt with various problems and challenges that arise in controlling crowds and maintenance of law and order. As per the report, water cannons developed by the DRDO are commonly used in crowd and riot control for dispersal or to prevent movement on particular position and are considered most effective methods to disperse mobs.
      
      As regards the use of “laughing gas” for controlling crowd, as less harmful detergent, BPR&D has not conducted any test/trial to asses its suitability for riot control.
      
      This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question by Shri Bhupender Yadav in the Rajya Sabha today.
