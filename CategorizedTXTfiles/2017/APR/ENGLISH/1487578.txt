      Posted On: 11 APR 2017 6:12PM by PIB Delhi


        To promote financial inclusion and to extend the banking network in unbanked areas, general permission has been granted by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to domestic Scheduled Commercial Banks including Public Sector Banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks) to open branches at any place in the country, without seeking prior approval of RBI in each case, subject to at least 25 percent of the total number of branches opened during a financial year being opened in unbanked rural (Tier 5 and Tier 6) centres (population up to 9,999). RBI has also specified that the total number of branches opened in Tier 1 centres (population 1,00,000 and above) during the financial year cannot exceed the total number of branches opened in Tier 2 to Tier 6 centres (population up to 99,999) and all centres in the North Eastern States and Sikkim.
