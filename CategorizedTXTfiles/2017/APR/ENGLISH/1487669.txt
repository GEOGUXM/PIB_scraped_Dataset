      Posted On: 12 APR 2017 4:18PM by PIB Delhi

      

      As per available information, registration certificates of more than 10,000 NGOs have been cancelled during financial year 2014-15 to 2016-17 for violation of FCRA, 2010 and Rules made there under. A list of such cancelled organization is available on the Ministryâ€™s website www.fcraonline.nic.in .


      FCRA Registrations have mainly been cancelled on account of non-filing of the annual returns as mandated in the FCRA, 2010 and rules made there under. The FCRA, 2010, Rules, FAQs and notices/advisories for filing of the Annual Returns and renewal application etc. have been put on the MHA website for creating greater legal awareness amongst the Voluntary Sector.


      This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question by Dr. Vinay P.Sahasrabuddhe in the Rajya Sabha today.
