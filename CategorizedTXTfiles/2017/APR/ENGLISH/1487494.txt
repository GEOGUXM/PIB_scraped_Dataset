    Standards of Mineral Water and Packaged Drinking Water (other than Mineral Water) have been prescribed under sub-regulation 2.10.7 and 2.10.8 of the Food Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards and Food Additives) Regulations, 2011 respectively. The standards for Packaged Drinking Water (other than Mineral Water) have recently been revised and notified on 15.11.2016. The officials of State/UT Governments are responsible for enforcement of law and regulations. FSSAI has written to State/UT authorities for ensuring compliance with regulations.
