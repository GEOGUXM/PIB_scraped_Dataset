      Posted On: 10 APR 2017 5:54PM by PIB Delhi


    Museum collections are being digitized by various museums under the Scheme for Financial Assistance for Digitisation of Museum Collections. Under the Scheme, the Government has so far provided financial assistance to 18 museums. No proposal is pending with the Government for grant of financial assistance under the scheme.
    
    The scheme aims at developing a National Database of all art objects and antiquities available with museums at various levels i.e. National level, State level and regional and local museums all across the country in order to provide enhanced accessibility to scholars, researchers and informed visitors.
    
    This information was given by Dr. Mahesh Sharma, Minister of State for Culture and Tourism (Independent Charge) in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
