      Posted On: 11 APR 2017 2:52PM by PIB Delhi


    Analysis of geographical distribution of leprosy by World Health Organization (WHO) shows that India accounted for the largest number of cases of leprosy at 60% of the global new cases reported during 2015 by 136 countries.
    
    With a view to eliminating leprosy from the country, a three-pronged strategy has been adopted for early detection of leprosy cases in the community during 2016-17:
    
    i. Leprosy Case Detection Campaign for high endemic districts.
    
    ii. Focused Leprosy Campaign for hot spots.
    
    iii. Specific plan for Case Detection in Hard to reach areas.
    
    All detected cases of leprosy are provided standard treatment in accordance with programme guidelines. For National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP), funds are provided to States/UTs under the National Health Mission. A budget provision of Rs. 46.00 crore has been made for NLEP for the Financial Year 2017-18.
    
    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
