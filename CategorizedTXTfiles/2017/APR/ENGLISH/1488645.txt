      Posted On: 26 APR 2017 12:56PM by PIB Delhi


    Several newspaper reports published on April 26th, 2017, state that NITI Aayog or its Draft Three year Action Agenda has recommended that Farm Income in India be taxed to expand the existing Income Tax base. The NITI Aayog categorically states that this is neither the view of the Aayog nor is such a recommendation made anywhere in the Draft Action Agenda document as circulated to the Governing Council at the meeting on 23rd April 2017.
    
    NITI Aayog notes that the views on Taxing Farm Income expressed by Member Shri BibekDebroy were personal and not those of the Aayog.
