    Central Water Commission (CWC) is monitoring water quality of river at 429 key locations covering 67 main rivers including Ganga, 138 tributaries and 55 sub-tributaries. CWC has published a report based on analysis of data for nine parameters viz. Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Iron, Lead, Mercury, Nickel and Zinc from 2011 to 2013. The report titled “Status of Trace and Toxic Metals in Indian Rivers” is available on the Website www.cwc.gov.in.


    Out of total 195 rivers/tributaries monitored by Central Water Commission during the period 2015 to 2016, there are 126 rivers where one or more parameters related to heavy metals exceeded the permissible limit.
