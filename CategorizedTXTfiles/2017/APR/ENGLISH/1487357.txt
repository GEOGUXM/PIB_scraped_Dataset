      Posted On: 10 APR 2017 2:21PM by PIB Delhi

      The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce and Industry had circulated to all States/Union Territories in October 2015, a 340 point Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP) with an objective to increase transparency and efficiency of various Government regulatory functions and services for business in India. The result of the Assessment of Implementation of Business Reforms 2015-16 by States/UTs was released on 31.10.2016. The Assessment studies the extent to which States/UTs have implemented DIPP’s 340-point BRAP, covering the period July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016. The BRAP includes recommendations for reforms on 58 regulatory processes, policies, practices and procedures spread across 10 reform areas, that is, access to information and transparency enablers; single window; environmental registration enablers; obtaining electricity connection; availability of land; construction permit enablers; inspection reform enablers; labour regulation enablers; online tax and return filing and commercial dispute resolution enablers spanning the lifecycle of a typical business.

        Data for assessment of Implementation of Business Reforms was collected from States/UTs on the BRAP portal http://eodb.dipp.gov.in . The portal, among the first of its kind globally, allowed States and UTs to submit evidence of implemented reforms. At least 32 States and UTs submitted evidence of implementation of 7,124 reforms. These submissions were reviewed by the World Bank team and validated by DIPP’s team to study whether they met the objectives of the BRAP. The portal allowed collaborative dialogue between DIPP and the States/UTs to analyse the evidence submitted. The results of the assessment demonstrate that States/UTs have increasingly risen to address the challenge of making it easier to do business. The national implementation average stands at 48.93% , which is significantly higher than the previous year’s national average of 32%. The table below demonstrates the progress made by States and their implementation score:
