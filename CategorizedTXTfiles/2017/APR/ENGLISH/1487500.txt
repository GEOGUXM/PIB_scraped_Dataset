      Ensuring Cheaper Medicines for Diabetics
      Posted On: 11 APR 2017 2:50PM by PIB Delhi


    According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Diabetes Atlas (2015), 69.2 million people have been diagnosed with diabetes representing 8.7% of adults aged 20- 79 years in India. As per Indian Council of Medical Researchâ€™s ICMR-INDAB Study on the prevalence of diabetes, the results available from 15 States/UTs indicate that overall prevalence of Diabetes varies from 4% to 13%. As per the National Family Health Survey-4 2015-16, in the age group of 15-49 years, 5.8% women and 8.0% men in India have blood sugar higher than 140 mg/dl.
    
    Public Health being a State subject, the primary responsibility of supply of medicines free of cost or at subsidized rates to the patients lies with the State/UT Governments. Provisioning of drugs and diagnostics is supported under National Health Mission (NHM) and National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) based on the proposals submitted by the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans.
    
    The treatment of diabetic patients both in Central and State Government Hospitals is either free or subsidized.
    
    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
