    With the increased revenue generation capacity of the Institute, the requirement of Government support has gone down.


    Government has vision to make IICA self-sustainable through revenue driven activities by taking various short-term/long-term capacity building programmes, research projects, advisory services in the field of company law, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, corporate governance, competition law & market regulation, corporate data management, organaizing short term executive development and training programmes in Corporate Social Responsibility and sustainability.


    This was stated by Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal, Minister of State for Corporate Affairs in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
