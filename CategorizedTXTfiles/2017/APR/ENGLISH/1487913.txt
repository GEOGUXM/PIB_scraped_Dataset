      Posted On: 13 APR 2017 6:00PM by PIB Delhi


      The workshop on the review of the National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP) concluded here today, on a high note with fruitful discussions and inputs from all stakeholders. The two-day workshop was organised by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).


      The NDMP, which was launched by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in June last year, provides for periodic reviews. To make this review process participatory and inclusive, NDMA had sought suggestions from State Governments and Ministries of the Central Government.


      Various Ministries made presentations suggesting ways to improve the Plan and discussed how to integrate Prime Ministerâ€™s 10-point agenda on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) into the national plan.


      Earlier in the day, Shri R. K. Jain, Member, NDMA, set the agenda by appraising the participants on the objectives of the workshop and summarising the discussions with State Government representatives.


      Discussions at this workshop will also form a part of the deliberations at the upcoming National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction (NPDRR), which will be held shortly.


      Senior officials of Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), NDMA, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) participated in the workshop.
