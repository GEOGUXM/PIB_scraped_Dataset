      Posted On: 12 APR 2017 5:13PM by PIB Delhi


    As per information received from Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT), the instructions regarding equal pay admissible to casual workers already exists in terms of DoPT O.M. No. 49014/2/86 Estt. (c) dated 07.06.1988. Further, Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) are under the administrative control of their respective Ministries / Departments and CPSEs are required to follow the various statutory provisions / Court orders / Government instructions including instructions on wage related issues of various categories of employees, wherever applicable. However, as the responsibility to monitor the implementation of above said statutory provisions / court orders / Government instructions vests with the Board of CPSEs and the concerned administrative Ministry / Department, as such no centralized information in this regard is maintained by Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) and accordingly complaints, if any, received against any CPSE on this issue are also forwarded to the concerned administrative Ministry / Department of CPSE for appropriate action.


    This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Rajya Sabha today.
