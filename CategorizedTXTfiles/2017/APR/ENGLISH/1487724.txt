        Presently IMD is providing Agromet services to farming community at District level. Research efforts are initiated by IMD to explore possibility of generating sub district scale Agrometeorological forecast with acceptable level of verification skill in a pilot mode.
        There is mechanism for dissemination of Agromet Advisories through multi-mode communication channels including mass and electronic media and also through SMS and IVR (Interactive Voice Response Technology) through Kisan Portal launched by Ministry of Agriculture, Govt. of India as well as private companies under PPP mode. At present 21.16 million farmers are receiving the information through SMS on regular basis.
        Under modernization plan, IMD has installed 550 AWS and 127 Agro-AWS throughout the country, so that the observational network would be strengthened. These AWS data would be useful in generating high resolution weather forecast. At present the scheme is implemented at district level covering 636 districts in the country.
        This information was given by Minister of State for Ministry of Science & Technology and Ministry of Earth Sciences Shri Y.S.Chowdary in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
