    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the SUMUL cattle feed plant at Bajipura in southern Gujarat. He also laid the Foundation Stone for three Lift Irrigation Schemes, and inaugurated the Drinking Water Supply Scheme for Vyara Town and Jesinhpur-Dolvan Groups of Tapi district.
    
    Addressing a large gathering, the Prime Minister recalled having worked in this area for a long time. He said SUMUL â€“ the Surat District Cooperative Milk Producers Union Limited - has empowered several people in the nearby areas. He said the stretch from Umbergaon to Ambaji has been transformed and this has benefited the tribal communities of Gujarat. Here, in SUMUL we see the positive results that can be achieved when Sahkar (Cooperatives) and Sarkar (Government) work together, the Prime Minister said. He said SUMUL also illustrates the good that happens when farmers and dairies work closely.
    
    The Prime Minister said that Tapi district is one of the newer districts of Gujarat, and he is happy to see it achieve remarkable progress.
    
    The Prime Minister called for value addition in the agriculture sector, and focus on increasing per capita milk production.
