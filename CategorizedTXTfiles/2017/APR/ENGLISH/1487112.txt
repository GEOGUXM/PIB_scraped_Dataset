    Cataract is mainly an age related diseases, which can be controlled by adopting appropriate measures and surgical procedures. Due to increase in population and life expectancy, the number of new cases of Cataract is likely to increase.


    However, NPCB in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is committed to reduce the burden of avoidable blindness in the country including blindness due to cataract to 0.3% by the year 2020 by adopting the following strategies:.


    · Decentralized implementation of NPCB through State/District Health Societies for close monitoring and supervision;


    · Reduction in the backlog of blind persons by active screening of population above 50 years, organizing eye screening camps and transporting operable cases to fixed eye-care facilities for operation/treatment;


    · Involvement of private practitioners in eye care services;


    · In-service training to eye surgeons in various fields of ophthalmology to refresh and develop clinical and surgical skills including Cataract;


    · Strengthening/developing of eye-care infrastructure at various levels to improve quantity and quality of eye-care services;


    · Provision for setting up Multipurpose District Mobile ophthalmic Units in District Hospitals to improve coverage area.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), SmtAnupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the LokSabha here today.
