    The primary responsibility of maintaining the CCIs vests with the States/UT Administration. The Ministry has been requesting the State Governments/UT Administrations from time to time to identify and register all Child Care Institutions under the provisions of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015, (JJ Act) so as to ensure that minimum standards of care can be maintained. Under Section 41 of the JJ Act, 2015 registration of CCIs has been made mandatory with penalty in case of non-compliance. Under Section 54,of the JJ Act, 2015 the State Governments are required to appoint inspection Committees for the State and district for mandatory inspection of all facilities housing children, at least once in three months.
