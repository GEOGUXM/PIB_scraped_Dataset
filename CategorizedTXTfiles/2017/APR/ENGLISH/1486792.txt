Further, the Law Commission of India in its 234th Report - Legal Reforms to Combat Road Accidents, has also recommended to insert a new section for causing death or injury by rash and negligent driving in the Indian Penal Code. Further, amendments to Cr.P.C. is an ongoing and continuous process based on Law Commission reports, or otherwise, through a consultative mechanism.
