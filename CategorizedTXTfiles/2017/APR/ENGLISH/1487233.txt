    Further, to expedite electrification of railway lines in the country, various steps have been taken, which inter-alia include award of turn-key contracts, better project monitoring mechanism, enhancing power of field units for award of contracts including sanction of estimates and increasing the number of executing agencies from existing three to six by entrusting electrification works to new agencies viz. Indian Railway Construction Company, Rail India Technical and Economic Services and Power Grid Corporation of India Limited.


    To reduce dependence on fossil fuels, Indian Railways have planned to source about 1000 Mega Watt (MW) Solar Power as a part of the Solar Mission of Railways and about 200 MW of power from wind mill power plants based on techno commercial assessments.
