    The Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing two schemes under Grant-in-Aid for assistance to Voluntary Organisations (VOs) for carrying out works related to empowerment of women and development of children. Family Counselling Centre (FCC) Scheme and National Creche Scheme are being implemented through voluntary organizations. Through Family Counselling Centres, professional counselling, referral and rehabilitative services are provided to women in distress, victims of atrocities, etc. National Creche Scheme is being implemented for the children of working mothers for carrying out works related to child development.


    Under Family Counselling Centre Scheme, during the year 2013-14, 169 new proposals were received against which 16 proposals were considered for sanction/release of grant. During 2014-15 allocation for setting-up for new centres was not made. The scheme has been revised w.e.f. 01.10.2015 and the allocation of Family Counselling Centres has been restricted at 800 centres per year. Hence, allocation for new centre has not been made since 2015-16 onwards. Under the National Creche Scheme, new crèches have not been considered since 2014-15. The numbers of Centres operational and amount released to States/UTs under FCC scheme for the last three years and current year are given below:
