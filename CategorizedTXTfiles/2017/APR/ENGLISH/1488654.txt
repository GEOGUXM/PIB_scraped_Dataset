    The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee has extended his greetings and felicitations to the Government and people of the Republic of South Africa on the eve of their Freedom Day (April 27, 2017).
    
    In a message to His Excellency Mr. Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma, the President of the Republic of South Africa, the President has said, “On behalf of the Government and the people of India and on my own behalf, it gives me great pleasure to extend to the friendly people of South Africa, warm greetings and felicitations on the occasion of your Freedom Day.
    
    India and South Africa share common values and strong historical linkages that form the bedrock of our close friendship. This year, we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of the historic signing of the Red Fort Declaration that elevated the relationship between our two countries to a strategic partnership. Our partnership is nurtured by our multifaceted and vibrant engagement in diverse sectors of our mutual interest. Our cooperation in the frame work of IBSA, BRICS and BASIC respectively have added value and substance to our engagement. The visit of Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi to South Africa in July, 2016 and Your Excellency’s participation in the ninth BRICS Summit in Goa in October, 2016 have contributed substantially to our joint efforts to strengthen and deepen our cooperation and will serve to reinforce the ties between India and South Africa in the coming years. I look forward to working with you to further strengthen our bilateral cooperation for the benefit of our two nations.
    
    Please accept, Excellency, my good wishes for your personal well-being, as well as for the progress and prosperity of the friendly people of South Africa”.
