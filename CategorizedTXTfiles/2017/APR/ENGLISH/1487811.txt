      Setting up of Heavy Industries in Newly Formed States
      Posted On: 12 APR 2017 5:19PM by PIB Delhi


    Since Industry is a State subject, no centralized data regarding setting up of heavy industries in any part of the country is maintained by the Department of Heavy Industry (DHI). The role of DHI is confined to the administration of a limited number of the Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) under its administrative control. However, these CPSEs take decision to set their units in various parts of the country based on the commercial considerations. Further, Central Government, through M/o Finance, also provides incentives in the direct and indirect tax structure for the growth of industries across the country. However, many States have evolved incentives and schemes for the development and growth of industries and these States encourage setting up of industries as per their priorities and investment climate and details of such nature are only expected to be available with them. At present, DHI has no plan to set up any new industry.


    This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Rajya Sabha today.
