    The attention is drawn to the media news about extension of working hours of Central Government employees by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Government of India. It has been stated in the news item that Central Government employeesâ€™ working hours will be changed from 09.00 AM to 07.00 PM. It was also stated that the holiday of Saturday will also be done away with for the Central Government employees.


    In this regard, the DoPT clarifies that there is no such proposal under consideration of the Central Government. The media news regarding the extension of working hours and abolition of holiday on Saturday for Central Government employees is false and baseless. There is no oral or unwritten order issued in this regard.
