    The safety measures, recommended by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, concerning safety of women commuters availing of cab services have been included in the new Taxi Policy Guidelines. These measures have been recommended by the WCD Minister , Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and Shipping (MoRTH).
    
    The recommendations come in the background of numerous cases of sexual harassment of women in cabs being reported to Smt. Maneka Gandhi on social media after women took to Twitter and Facebook to flag their ordeal.

    •The taxis should be mandatorily fitted with GPS panic devices.
    
    •For the safety of women and child passengers, the central locking system in the taxis should not be allowed.
    
    •The driver's identification along with the photo and registration number of the vehicle should also be prominently displayed in the taxi.
    
    •Violation of the stipulated rules by the taxi operators/drivers should be strictly dealt in accordance with law.
    
    •Sharing of seat should be subject to willingness of passengers.
    
    The recommendations made by the WCD Minister have now been approved for inclusion in the regulatory guidelines. Smt. Gandhi has thanked Sh. Nitin Gadkari for accepting the recommendations to help implement measures for increased safety of women in taxis/cabs.
    
    Women commuters have been expressing their concern via social media to Smt Maneka Gandhi regarding safety in taxis. The WCD Minister has launched a hashtag, #HelpMeWCD, where any woman or child facing harassment/ violence can directly report their cases by tweeting.
