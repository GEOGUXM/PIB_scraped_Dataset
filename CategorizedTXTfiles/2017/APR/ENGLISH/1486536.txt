      Posted On: 03 APR 2017 5:29PM by PIB Delhi


    The Delhi Horse Show has been in existence since the early part of 20th century. In the days of Raj, it was considered one of the main events in the Indian social calendar and everyone descended on Delhi from all part of the Country. After Independence, the tradition continued and it remained India’s premier Horse Show till it was discontinued in 1979.
    
    In 1986, the erstwhile Delhi Polo Club decided to revive the Show, which is the only equestrian show in India that has events involving Tent Pegging, Dressage and Show Jumping events for serious riders to fun gymkhana events for little tots and teenagers. Army’s Polo & Riding Club has been organizing this biggest and most popular Horse Show in India for the past 31 years.
    
    This year Delhi Horse Show saw over 500 horses and competitors in action from 26 Mar to 02 Apr 2017 from across the country in four categories – senior, young rider, junior and children. Participants included the 61st Cavalry, President’s Bodyguard, RVC, ASC, Army Commands, National Defence Academy, Assam Rifles, Punjab Police, BSF, Delhi Police, MP Police, ITBP and prominent senior civilians. Reputed schools and colleges including Rashtriya Indian Military College, Mayo College, Punjab Public School, Nabha also had a formidable representation.
    
    Lt Gen Ashok Ambre, Quartermaster General and President of Army’s Polo & Riding Club gave away the major prizes during a grand Ceremony on 02 Apr 2017.
