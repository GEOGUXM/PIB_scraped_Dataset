    The National Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy, which was approved by the Union Cabinet on 12th May 2016, is a significant move forward to encourage creativity and stimulate innovation in the country.
    
    Joint Secretary Rajiv Aggarwal from DIPP said IPR Awareness: Outreach and Promotion is the first and foremost objective of the National IPR Policy and is critical to shaping an IP environment that is conducive to fostering creativity & innovation in the country. He said that one of the key focus areas is children in schools, as it is essential to nurture creativity and the ability to innovate from a young age. Mr Aggarwal said a streamlined system is being worked out to conduct over 3500 awareness programmes in schools, universities and the industry across the country including Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 cities as well as rural areas along with translating the content to various regional languages for a wider reach.
    
    The programme was an hour long interactive session with a presentation delivered by the INTA Working Group which included various games and activities to keep the kids engaged. Along with the presentation, colorful and vibrant posters on different IPs were put up and mementos including a brochure on IP designed for kids was given to all students in attendance of the session.
