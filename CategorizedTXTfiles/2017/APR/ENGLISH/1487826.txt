      Setting up of New CPSEs
      Posted On: 12 APR 2017 5:14PM by PIB Delhi


    Since Industry is a State subject, no centralized data regarding setting up of new heavy industry in any part of the country is maintained by the Department of Heavy Industry (DHI). The role of DHI is confined to the administration of the Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) under its administrative control. However, these CPSEs take decision to set up their units in various parts of the country based on the commercial considerations. However, States encourage setting up of industries as per their priorities and investment climate and details of such nature are only expected to be available with them. At present, DHI has no plan to set up any new industry.


    This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Rajya Sabha today.
