    The state level incidence for Tuberculosis has not been estimated, however the total case notified across the states in the last three years is at Annexure.


    The total case notification for the last three years for the state of Rajasthan including that from the private sector has been 95199 in 2014, 102032 in 2015 and 106756 in 2016 respectively.


    The Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme is being implemented under the aegis of the National Health Mission with the following steps


    · strengthening and improving quality of basic TB services,


    · addressing TB HIV co-infection, other co-morbidities and MDR-TB


    · engaging with care providers both in the public and the private sector


    · targeted intervention in the vulnerable population and strengthening urban TB control along with active case finding activities


    · integrating newer molecular diagnostics for TB in the health system (CBNAAT) for early diagnosis of MDR TB


    · leveraging of Information Communication Technology for enhancing TB notification and strengthening of monitoring.


    According to the WHO Global TB Reports, the estimated proportion of Multi- Drug Resistant TB Cases in India is not increasing. The proportion of MDR cases is estimated to be in between 1.9 – 2.6 percent among new TB cases and between 11- 19 percent among retreatment cases.


    However, the detection of MDR-TB/XDR-TB cases has been increasing due to availability of more diagnostic facilities for MDR TB/XDR-TB and coverage of the entire country through Programmatic Management of Drug Resistant TB under the Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP).


    Cases of Multi Drug Resistant TB detected for Rajasthan for the last three years are 2050 in 2014, 1930 in 2015 and 2118 for 2016 respectively.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
