    Commerce and Industry Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman has said that Government believes in active sharing of ideas and responding to citizen’s queries. On completion of one year of Twitter Seva/MOCI Seva she said Today marks the one full year of Twitter Seva/ MOCI Seva, which is Ministry of Commerce & Industry Seva. The Minister said It was a hashtag that we created for the ministry, just so that we would be able to answer any query related to the ministry or complaints that people want us to look into and serve the cause.

    
    Smt. Sitharaman said she was glad that people had approached in quite a big number and 99% had been served within the limitation that we had set for ourselves that is 2 working days. She said the number of queries were more that complaints and she would request anyone who would want to approach the Commerce and Industry Ministry to feel free to use the ‘Seva’. The Minister thanked the people for using the ‘Seva’ and looked forward to serving in even more and better way.
    
    MOCISEVA was launched on 21st April, 2016. It is a girevance redressal mechanism via twitter where grievances are addressed pertaining to various divisions of Ministry of Commerce & Industries. Through this Seva the Ministry has not only responded to queries that pertain to its own Divisions but has responded to almost 1000 queries that belonged to other ministries.
