    An Inter-Ministerial Group was constituted by NITI Aayog to examine the emerging data on undernutrition and prepare a specific strategy for poor performing States/Districts. The recommendation of the Inter-Ministerial Group has been finalized in a report entitled “Toward Kuposhan Mukt Bharat: National Nutrition Strategy”. For this, consultations were held with the States/UTs, Central Government Ministries and a clutch of institutions and experts and the suggestions/recommendations received from Members of the Inter-Ministerial Group have been incorporated in the report.
    
    Some of the core strategies to address the issue of undernutrition in the country as envisaged in the report are convergence of States/District Implementation plans; reaching the most vulnerable communities in the districts/blocks with highest levels of child undernutrition; counselling to reach the critical age group through skilled counsellors; continuum of care that includes preventive, promotive and curative care; innovative service delivery models with evidence of impact; community based monitoring; implementing innovative components of ICDS and strengthening nutrition within the health system.
