        No such targets were fixed for Capital Goods Industry which includes its sub- sectors like Machine Tools, Earthmoving & Mining Machinery, Heavy Electrical Equipment. No such targets were fixed for Automobile Industries as well. However, the Government in consultation with Automobile Industry envisions a growth path in the form of Automobile Mission Plan. First such plan was launched in 2006 for the period of 10 years. The performance of this Plan is given below:


         India has attracted significant quantum of local and global automobile manufacturers


        (OEMs) as well as component manufacturers, exceeding the target of Rs.1,57,500 crores.


         While cumulative domestic sales volume of commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles


        and tractors have been achieved, 2 and 3 Wheelers have fallen short of their targets.


        The Government has launched a Scheme in November, 2014 for enhancement of ecompetitiveness in the Indian Capital Goods Sector having infrastructural components like setting up of (1) Centre of Excellence for technology development, (2) Integrated Industrial Infrastructural facility i.e. industrial park (3) Common Engineering Facility Centre and (4) Test & Certification Centre. The Scheme also has provision for financial intervention by way of Technology Acquisition Fund Programme for acquisition/ transfer of technology. Details of the Scheme are available in the Department of Heavy Industry website. (dhi.nic.in). So far 14 proposals have been approved under different components of the Scheme.


        Further, the Government has recently launched a National Capital Goods Policy in 2016 under ‘Make in India’ initiative with a view to realize the potential of domestic capital goods industry. Details of the Policy may be seen at the Department of Heavy Industry website.(dhi.nic.in).


        As far as Automobile Sector is concerned, Government has taken a series of steps for the promotion of the Industry, like launching of FAME India Scheme for promotions of Electric and Hyrid Vehicles and establishment of state of the art vehicle testing centres under NATRIP Project.


        This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Rajya Sabha today.
