    The factual data shows marginal shortfall in achieving the targets, which is on account of reasons like delay in receipt of inputs from trade sources both indigenous and import origin, capacity constraints in some areas, Non realization of advance from Police units and civil market for arms and weapons, delay in indents for logistic vehicles, Non receipt of Bulk Production Clearance, etc. However, in terms of value of Issue, the year 2015-16 achieved a growth of 14.80%.


    CAG audit has indicated instances of advance issue of vouchers. The cases of advance issue vouchers mentioned by CAG audit have been examined in consultation with OFB for corrective action. Principal Controller of Accounts (Factories) has instructed Branch Account Offices not to accept issue vouchers without dispatch details. With the introduction of payment of Excise Duties (ED) by the Ordnance Factories on their products from 1 st June, 2015, Issues of the items are linked with Excise Gate Pass thereby eliminating instances of advance issue vouchers.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Defence Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri B. V. Naik in Lok Sabha today.
