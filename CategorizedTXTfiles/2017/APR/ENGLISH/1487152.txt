      Supply of High-Nitrogen Steel
      Posted On: 07 APR 2017 4:51PM by PIB Delhi


    The Technology of processing Nickel Free High-Nitrogen Steel (HNS) has been developed by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). HNS has been found to have potential for use in armour applications. Non-exclusive Transfer of Technology (ToT) has been given to M/s Jindal Stainless Hisar Limited, a private industry, on 1st March, 2017. This being a non-exclusive ToT, the technology can also been transferred to any other private or public industry, interested in absorbing this technology. However, the ToT does not involve a supply agreement.
    
    The development of HNS was initiated as a basic Research & Development (R&D) and the technology fits to the policy of ‘Make in India’ initiative.
    
    HNS has potential for use in all armour applications. However, for material to be qualified and used in a specific combat vehicle application, it has to undergo many types of tests by the designers of the vehicle, including ballistic testing against specific ammunitions. The qualification of any material for its introduction into any armoured application is a long process and HNS has not yet been qualified for use in these applications.
    
    This information was given by Defence Minister Shri Arun Jaitley in a written reply to Shri B. Senguttuvan in Lok Sabha today.
