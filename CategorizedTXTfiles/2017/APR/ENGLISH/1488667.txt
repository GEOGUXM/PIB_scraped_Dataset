The Minister has asked NADA to organize a seminar with all stakeholders tomorrow to discuss the issue threadbare and finalize an effective strategy to deal with the menace, including the possibility of making doping a criminal offence.


    He has also directed the NADA to sensitize the players at grassroots level about the ill-effects of doping through regular seminars and information campaigns at schools and colleges. Shri Goel added that the Government is contemplating to set up a mechanism to test food supplements, so that athletes can be sure that the food supplements they are using, are free of prohibited substances.
