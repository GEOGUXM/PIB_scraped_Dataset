      Posted On: 12 APR 2017 4:27PM by PIB Delhi

      
      As on 01.01.2016, total authorised strength of IPS is 4802.
      
      Calculation of authorised strength depends upon functional requirement of a particular cadre. As per rule 4 (2) of IPS Cadre Rules, 1954, the Central Government, ordinarily at the interval of every five years, reviews the strength and composition of each such cadre in consultation with the State Government(s) concerned and revises the authorised strength of the IPS for each Cadre. The authorised strength includes Senior Duty Post, Central Deputation Reserve, State Deputation Reserve, Leave Reserve & Junior Reserve, Training Reserve and Promotion quota.
      
      As on 01.01.2016, 3894 IPS officers are in-position against authorised strength of 4802. As such, there are 908 vacancies in Indian Police Service as on 01.01.2016.
      
      The authorised strength of IPS in Kerala is 163 as on 01.01.2016. There are 41 vacancies of IPS existing in Kerala as on 01.01.2016.
      
      This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question by Shri K. Somaprasad in the Rajya Sabha today.
