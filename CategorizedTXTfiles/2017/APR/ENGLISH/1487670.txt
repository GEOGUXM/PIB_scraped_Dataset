      Database of Foreign Nationals Visiting India
      Posted On: 12 APR 2017 4:19PM by PIB Delhi


      The Government under the Immigration, Visa and Foreigners Registration Tracking (IVFRT) project is maintaining database of arrival/departure and visa details of all foreigners visiting India. A Unique Case File (UCF) is created for each of the Indian Visa applicants and all the details are clubbed. So far about 2.70 crore UCF has been created. The UCF data is useful in getting details that may be needed in specific cases. It helps in better profiling of the foreigners at the Immigration Counters in less time.

      
      The IVFRT project approved in 2010 and implemented in 2011 has so far covered 163 Indian Mission, 674 FROs/Districts, 87 Immigration Check Posts (ICPs) and 21 State Home Departments. For now, the project has been extended for six months beyond 31.03.2017.
      
      On the basis of information provided by the Narcotics Control Bureau, more than 200 foreigners have been arrested and prosecuted under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 during 2016.
      
      This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question by Shri Ranjib Biswal in the Rajya Sabha today.
