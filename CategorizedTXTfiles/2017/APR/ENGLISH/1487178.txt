As per RBI guidelines, all Scheduled Commercial Banks including PSBs are allowed to extend voluntary contribution / donation during a financial year, aggregating up to 1% of their published profit for the previous year.


    RBI vide its circular dated December 20, 2007 has issued guidelines on Corporate Social Responsibility, Sustainable Development and Non-Financial Reporting – Role of Banks. RBI advised banks to put in place a suitable and appropriate plan of action towards helping the cause of sustainable development, with the approval of their Boards. Further, it has advised banks / financial institutions to keep themselves abreast of the developments on an on-going basis and dovetail / modify their strategies / plans etc. in the light of such developments.

In case of loss making banks, they can make donations totaling Rs. 5.00 lakhs only in a financial year. Such spending on donations by banks is voluntary in nature subject to respective Board’s approval.
