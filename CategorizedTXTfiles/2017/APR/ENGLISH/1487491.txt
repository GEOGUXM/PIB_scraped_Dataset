      Strengthening of Prime Health Centres (PHCs)
      Posted On: 11 APR 2017 2:32PM by PIB Delhi


    Public health and hospitals being a State subject, the performance of Primary Health Centres (PHCs) is to be monitored by the State Governments. However, various public health facilities, including PHCs are regularly monitored and evaluated through Health Management Information System (HMIS). Further, Common Review Missions (CRMs) also undertake a review of National Health Mission (NHM) annually, that inter-alia includes review of functioning of PHCs.
    
    To encourage States to tone up the public health system, the Government is providing incentives to States based on functionality achieved by various public health facilities including District Hospitals, Community Health Centres, Primary Health Centres etc. and grading of the facilities based on indicators including availability of health Human Resource (HR), basic diagnostics, medicines for the patients etc.
    
    Public health and hospitals is a State subject. However, under NHM, technical and financial support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their health facilities, including PHCs, as per Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS). This includes support for engagement of health HR, drugs and equipment, infrastructure, diagnostics, MIS systems etc. This support is provided based on the requirement proposed by the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans. The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Faggan Singh Kulaste stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
