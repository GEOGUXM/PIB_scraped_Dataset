    Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has said that intellectual honesty is as important as intellectual thought and that most of the conflicts in intellectual arena arise when the thought is devoid of honesty and instead influenced by extraneous considerations.
    
    In his inaugural address as Chief Guest at the one day conference on the theme “Communicating India”, organized by Vivekananda International Foundation in collaboration with Prasar Bharati, here today, Dr Jitendra Singh said a constant introspection coupled with critical appraisal of one’s inner self is what finally churns out an unbiased belief or conviction. Describing youth aspiration as the predominant factor determining contemporary India’s thought process, Dr Jitendra Singh appealed the youth to seek one’s own original belief from the core of one’s conviction.
    
    Dr Jitendra Singh’s lecture was followed by a lucid interaction in which youth from different streams of academics participated with great enthusiasm and involvement.
