                    Crude Oil


            1. Crude oil production during March, 2017 was 3090.40 TMT which is 6.26% lower than target but 0.94 % higher when compared with March 2016. Cumulative crude oil production during April, 2016 - March, 2017 was 36008.40 TMT which is 2.90% and 2.53% lower than target and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Unit-wise and state-wise crude oil production is given at Annexure-I. Unit-wise crude oil production for the month of March, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April, 2016 - March, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-1 and month-wise in Figure-1.

            Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


            Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall have been given in following sub-sections:


            1.1 Crude oil production by ONGC during March, 2017 was 1931.29 TMT which is 5.51% lower than the monthly target but 3.32% higher when compared with March, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April, 2016 - March, 2017 was 22217.94 TMT which is 2.41% lower than target for the period and 0.63% lower than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


            v Delay in deployment of MOPU-Sagar Samrat in WO-16


            v Delay in implementation of “Development of Western Periphery of MHS (ZC)” Project.


            v Natural decline in matured fields of Western Offshore.


            1.2 Crude oil production by OIL during March, 2017 was 293.20 TMT which is 14.83% lower than monthly target but 9.06% higher than production in March, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April, 2016 - March, 2017 was 3258.03 TMT which is 6.38% lower than target for the period but 0.99% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


            v Less than planned contribution from high producing areas like Greater Hapjan, Shalmari, Chandmari and Moran fields primarily on account of rise in water cut.


            v Less than planned contribution from newly drilled wells.


            1.3 Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during March, 2017 was 865.91 TMT which is 4.73% lower than the monthly target and 6.23% lower than March, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April, 2016 - March, 2017 was 10532.43 TMT which is 2.83% lower than target for the period and 7.25% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


            v RJ-ON-90/1: Mangala production is less due to liquid cut back for rectification of 14" MPT to CPF feed water line leak on 6.3.2017. Few high water cut wells closed at Mangala, poor reservoir performance of Bhagyam.


            v Panna-Mukta: PF platform shutdown for riser remedial since 27.02.2017.


            v CY-ONN-2002/2: Under Test Production.


            v Natural Decline in Ravva.


            Natural Gas


            2 Natural gas production during March, 2017 was 2750.29 MMSCM which is 11.74% lower than the target for the month but 8.29% higher when compared with March, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production during April, 2016 - March, 2017 was 31896.67 MMSCM which is 6.51% lower than target for the period and 1.09% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II. Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of March, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April, 2016 -March, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


            v Underperformance of wells in KG- OSN-2001/3.


            v Underperformance of Sohagpur West CBM block, closure of few wells for maintenance in Raniganj East CBM block.


            v Closure of 2 wells in D1D3 field in KG-DWN-98/3. Gas rate reduced to study potential sand incursion issue in MA2 & study well performance vis-à-vis water production in MA8 since 13.03.2017.


            v Panna-Mukta: PF platform shutdown for riser remedial measures since 27.02.2017.


            v RJ-ON-90/1: Mangala production is less due to liquid cut back for rectification of 14" MPT to CPF feed water line leak on 6.3.2017. Few high water cut wells closed at Mangala, poor reservoir performance of Bhagyam.


            v RJ-ON/6: Increase in Water cut in few wells.


            Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)


            3 Refinery production during March, 2017 was 21312.91 TMT which is 3.83% higher than the target for the month but 0.33% lower when compared with March, 2016. Cumulative production during April, 2016-March, 2017 was 245368.89 TMT which is 2.06% higher than the target for the period and 5.37% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III. Company-wise production for the month of March, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April, 2016 - March, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

            Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production


            3.1 PSU Refineries’ production during March, 2017 was 12139.82 TMT which is 2.70% higher than the target for the month and 1.57% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by PSU refineries during April, 2016 - March, 2017 was 137394.61 TMT which is 1.34% higher than the target for the period and 8.11% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some PSU refineries are as under:


            v IOCL, Paradip: Throughput is lower due to coke containment.


            v IOCL, Haldia: Throughput is lower due to VGO stock build-up due to problems in OHCU.


            v IOCL, Digboi / Guwahati: Lower availability of Assam crude.


            v BPCL, Mumbai: Throughput is lower due to shifting of CDU3 shutdown and BS4 implementation.


            v CPCL, Manali: Lower due OHCU shutdown.


            3.2 Production in JV refineries during March, 2017 was 1347.74 TMT which is 42.08% higher than the target for the month and 14.42% lower than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April, 2016 - March, 2017 was 16881.52 TMT which is 12.54% higher than the target for the period but 1.37% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year.


            3.3 Production in private refineries during March, 2017 was 7825.35 TMT which is 0.88% lower than the target for the month and 0.4% lower when compared with March, 2016. Cumulative production by private refineries during April, 2016 - March, 2017 was 91092.77 TMT which is 1.38% higher than the target for the period and 2.74% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year.


            3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of March, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April, 2016 - March, 2017 vis-à-vis April, 2015 - March, 2016 are given at Annexures-IV and V respectively.
