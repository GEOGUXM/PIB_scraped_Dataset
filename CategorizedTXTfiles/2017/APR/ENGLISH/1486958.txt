      Posted On: 06 APR 2017 4:15PM by PIB Delhi


    Environment education is already an integral part of school curriculum. The National Curriculum Framework (NCF)-2005 infuses the components of environmental education as part of different disciplines in the treatment of content in Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, History, Political Science, Health and Physical Education, Art, Music, etc. As a follow-up of NCF-2005, syllabi and textbooks for all the stages of school education have been developed by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT). For Classes I and II, Environmental Studies (EVS) components are integrated with language and mathematics. For classes III to V, the NCERT has developed EVS syllabus and the textbooks integrating Science and Social Science components. For classes VI onwards, essential EVS components are integrated across subject areas. Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has also issued directives to schools to impart environmental education to students.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Shri Upendra Kushwaha today in a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question.
