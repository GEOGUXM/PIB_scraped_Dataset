      Statement of Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu, Minister for I&B - Allegations of imposition of Hindi completely false

        “I was pained to read in a section of the press today news reports wherein DMK leader Shri M.K. Stalin has been quoted alleging imposition of Hindi by the Central Government.


        Shri Stalin was quoted as saying that the Parliamentary Committee (on Official Language) proposed to make it mandatory for Members of Parliament and Union Ministers who know Hindi to use it, both in speech and writing. He further alleged that an Ordinance to this effect has been issued thereby suggesting that Government is imposing Hindi.


        I would like to clarify that the Parliamentary Committee on Official Language headed by the then Home Minister, Shri P. Chidambaram made a recommendation as follows and the same was forwarded to Hon’ble President of India on 2 nd June, 2011 :-


        “This Committee suggests that all those occupying high political offices and who can speak and read Hindi language may be requested to give their speeches / statements in Hindi. Hon’ble President and all Ministers come in this category”.


        The present Government notified this recommendation on 31 st March, 2017.


        This shows that the suggestion of the Parliamentary Committee on Official Language was only recommendatory and not mandatory. It is totally false and mischievous to allege that an Ordinance was passed in this regard.


        It may be recalled that DMK was a member of the Government of India in 2011 when this recommendation was made and forwarded by the Parliamentary Committee to the Hon’ble President.


        Government of India has no intention of imposing any language on anyone.”
