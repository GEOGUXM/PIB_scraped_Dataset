    The responsibility of dealing with law and order problem rests primarily with the respective State Governments. However the efforts of State Government of Manipur were supplemented by the Central Government. As per the information received from Ministry of Home Affairs, the following steps were taken by the Government of India to clear up the blockade imposed by UNC, of National Highways leading into Manipur since 01.11.2016. Ministry of Home Affairs provided additional Central Armed Police Force companies to assist the State Government of Manipur for maintenance of law and order and security coverage for movement of essential supplies, including movement of petroleum products on National Highways, into Manipur.
    
    Besides movement of goods/POL products under security convoys, POL products were airlifted to Manipur.
    
    There was intervention at the level of Union Home Minister who held a meeting with the Chief Ministers of Nagaland and Manipur to impress upon the urgency of opening of National Highways in Manipur.
    
    Ministry of Home Affairs took initiative to hold tripartite meetings with Government of Manipur and UNC to resolve the issue. Meetings were held on 15.11.2016, 03.02.2017, 07.02.2017 and 19.03.2017. The blockade has since been lifted by UNC with effect from 19.03.2017.
