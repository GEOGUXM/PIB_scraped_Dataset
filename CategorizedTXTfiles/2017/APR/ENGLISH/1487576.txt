      The Government has decided to bring all welfare and subsidy schemes under DBT. As on date, more than 500 Schemes/ Components of 63 Ministries/ Departments have been identified to be implemented through DBT mode. As on 20.3.2017, 90 welfare and subsidy schemes are being reported on DBT Bharat Portal.


      In respect of DBT schemes, Aadhaar is being used as a unique identifier for accurate targeting of intended beneficiaries. In case the beneficiary does not possess Aadhaar or Aadhaar Enrolment ID, the beneficiary is allowed to avail subsidy/ benefits using alternate documents as per guidelines/ notification issued for the scheme.


      This was stated by Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal, Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
