    Railways need increased revenue in 2017-18 not only to meet higher revenue expenditure assessed in Budget Estimates 2017-18 but also to have surplus so as to supplement Railways’ capital expenditure from internal resources.


    Accordingly, a 9.8% increase in Gross Traffic Receipts of Railways has been targeted in Budget Estimates 2017-18.


    In order to increase the revenue earnings in freight transportation and to improve the efficiency of freight traffic specially for non-conventional traffic in high capacity and special purpose wagons, following schemes have been introduced for procurement of rakes for freight transportation by inviting private investment through partnerships:


    · Liberalized Wagon Investment Scheme: So far, out of 68 rakes for which approval for procurement has been accorded to various customers, 32 rakes have been procured/inducted and are running in the system.


    · Wagon Leasing Scheme: Two Companies have been registered under the scheme as Wagon Leasing Companies who have procured 12 rakes of BLC wagons and 1 BTAP rake. Approval for 4 new BLC, 1 BTAP and 6 BFNS (22.9t axle load) rakes have been accorded.


    · Special Freight Train Operators Scheme: So far, 3 rakes of BRNA wagons have been inducted and approval for procurement of 3 rakes of BFNS (22.9t axle load) has been given.

    Further, to facilitate rapid development of a network of freight terminals with private investment, to provide efficient and cost effective logistic services with warehousing solution to end users, a scheme namely Private Freight Terminal (PFT) has been introduced.
