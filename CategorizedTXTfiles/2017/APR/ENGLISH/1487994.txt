    Indian Air Force is embarking upon a mountaineering expedition to Mt Dhaulagiri in Nepal from 15 Apr to 03 Jun 2017. Mt Dhaulagiri is the seventh highest mountain in the world at 8167 M (26795 Ft) and is the peak which was conquered last among the peaks above 8000 meters.

    
    A team of 12 IAF mountaineers led by Gp Capt RC Tripathi, would attempt to summit the peak. Earlier, in 2005, IAF had created history by hoisting tricolour and IAF flag on top of the World during its first ever expedition to Mt Everest and again in 2011 during the all women Everest expedition. Keeping the spirit of its motto ‘Touch the Sky with Glory’, IAF is poised to hoist the national and IAF flag on summit of this mountain. This exposes the air warriors to varied operational environments, and is aimed to promote mountaineering in IAF and thereby motivating the Indian youth to join Indian Air Force.
