    Rubber growers can contact Rubber Board Call Centre to know more about the pre planting operations in rubber. Ms. Phebe Joseph, Scientist, Rubber Research Institute of India will answer the questions on the subject on 05 April 2017 from 10 am to 1 pm. The Call Centre number is 0481 - 2576622.


    Pre planting operations in rubber are very much important and should be planned with a long term vision. It is not possible to correct the shortfalls in planting in a perennial crop like rubber which has a life span of 25-30 years. Rubber Research Institute of India has developed suitable agronomic practices for rubber through years of research. These research findings should be utilized right from the preparation of land. Cost of cultivation could be reduced substantially by adopting new agricultural practices.


    Information about the services of the Board and also technical advice regarding cultivation, production, processing, etc. of rubber can be regularly sought from the Call Centre functioning at its Head Office. The service is available from 9.30 am to 5.30 pm on all working days.
