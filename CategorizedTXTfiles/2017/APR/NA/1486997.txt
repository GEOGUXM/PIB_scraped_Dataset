    The Government has issued instructions to all the Ministries/Departments of Govt. of India from time to time impressing upon the Public Authorities to disclose maximum information proactively under Section 4 of RTI Act, so as to reduce the need for filing RTI applications by the citizens.


    For speedy disposal of pending cases the Government has taken several steps like capacity building through training of Central Public Information Officers (CPIOs) / Public Information Officers (PIOs) and issue of guidelines for PIOs and First Appellate Authorities (FAAs), so as to enable them to supply information / dispose of first appeal effectively, resulting into less number of ‘First Appeals’ and ‘Appeals’ to the Information Commission.


    This was stated by the Minister of State in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions and Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office Dr. Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question by Prof. M.V. Rajeev Gowda in the Rajya Sabha today.
