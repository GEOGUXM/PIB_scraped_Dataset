    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today dedicated India’s longest road tunnel, the 9 kilometre long Chenani-Nashri Tunnel in Jammu and Kashmir, to the nation.
    
    The Prime Minister travelled the entire length of the tunnel, and was briefed on some of its key features.
    
    Addressing a public meeting in Udhampur, the Prime Minister said that the tunnel is world-class, and matches the best standards. He said the tunnel is environment-friendly and will help in the fight against global warming. He said that while some misguided youngsters were pelting stones, the youth of Kashmir were cutting stones to create infrastructure. He said the tunnel would also boost tourism, which will bring economic growth.
    
    The Prime Minister said that violence and terrorism can never help anyone. He thanked the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Ms. Mehbooba Mufti, and said that work had begun on the package that the Union Government had announced for the State.
    
    Recalling the vision and work of former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the Prime Minister said that the Union Government's sole mantra is development, and this could be achieved through people’s participation.
