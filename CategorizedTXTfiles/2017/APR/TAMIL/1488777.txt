    The Employeesâ€™ State Insurance Corporation, in its 170 th meeting held on 15-12-2016, has approved the scheme to promote registration of Establishment/Factories and employees (SPREE) coverable under the ESI Act, 1948


    Under the new scheme drive, intended to extend the social security benefits to all eligible under the Act, who have till now been kept out of the ESI coverage, and was initially opened for the period from 20 th December 2016 to 31 st March 2017.


    Now based on the references received from the Employers and Employer associations seeking extension, the Competent Authority extended the Scheme SPREE from 1st April 2017 to 30th June 2017.


    The salient features of the scheme remains as under:


     1. The employers registering during the period will be treated as covered from the date of registration or as declared by them.

     2. The newly registered employees shall be treated as covered from the date of their registration
     3. This will not have any bearing on actions taken/required under ESI Act, if any, prior to 20 th December, 2016

    All the employers/employees are encouraged to use this opportunity and ensure that all the units/employees coverable under the ESI Act are registered availing the one time benefits of the scheme.
