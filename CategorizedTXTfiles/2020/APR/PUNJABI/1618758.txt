    Chandigarh, April 27,2020
    The resumption of industrial and manufacturing activities in the states of Punjab and Haryana has brought relief to the people dependent on them. The Government of India in its order on 20 April 2020 has allowed resumption of selected industrial and manufacturing activities except in containment zones in hotspots. After this, these activities have been restarted by the state governments in their respective jurisdictions.
    The shops of agriculture machinery have been in the list of allowed activities under the category of agricultural and related activities. Duni Chand from Haryana, an owner of such a shop said it is good because he can earn his livelihood which gives him a sense of self-sufficiency and dignity. Harvesting season is on in states like Punjab and Haryana and this requires the need for constant repair & maintenance of machines. This will smoothen the flow of agricultural operations which are at its peak.

    As industries have resumed its operations in the region, further relaxations have come as a reprieve to people owning small shops. Vijay Kumar, who owns a welding shop said that opening his shop for few hours helps him earn as he has no other source of livelihood. In continuation of relief efforts during the lockdown, on 21st April 2020 book shops were also added to the list of allowed activities. Rahul Goyal, a Panjab University student, said he was trying to get books as exams will be conducted when university reopens.
