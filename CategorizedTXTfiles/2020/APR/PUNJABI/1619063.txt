    Chandigarh, April 28,2020
    People have shown awareness and self-responsibility on COVID-19 along with economic activities being resumed in the region. This can also be seen in the light of the Prime Minister stating on Monday in an interaction with CMs of the states that we have to give importance to the economy as well as continue the fight against COVID-19. The government has made a number of relaxations from 20 April 2020 in non-containment zones for selected activities.
    The Lockdown has yielded positive results as the country has managed to save thousands of lives in the past one and a half months. The situation in many countries, including India, was almost similar at the start of March. However, due to timely measures, India has been able to protect many people. The sense of responsibility in the lockdown situation amongst the people is evident from the following.
    Mohammad Irfan from Panchkula says that we are praying in our homes as mass gathering is not allowed. While supporting the lockdown measures he also said it is important for everyone’s health to comply with government guidelines in the light of situation due to COVID-19. Anganwadi worker Shashibala from Palwal district in Haryana is also a Corona warrior in her own way. She said that after carrying out her daily routine, she and her group of Anganwadi workers make masks which are distributed free to the people. Police personnel in Lahaul & Spiti district in Himachal Pradesh are not the ones who are leaving anything to fate as they can be seen training the rural women folk about the precautions to be taken in view of COVID-19. Taking no chances, government agencies also ensure to avoid crowd gathering when providing services.

    The relaxations have come as a relief to farmers in the region due to ongoing harvesting season as 55-60% of wheat crop in Haryana and 60-65% in Punjab have been harvested as per the reports provided by the states. It has also been ensuring the livelihood of industries associated with the agricultural sector like combine and thresher manufacturing units.
