    The Government of India has been seeking feedback from the suppliers of the essential services regularly in addition to keeping its momentum against COVID-19. Today in a meeting via video conferencing with Doctors and Senior representatives of IMA, Union Home Minister Shri Amit Shah, allaying all concerns of the medical fraternity, has assured them that the Union Government would leave no stone unturned in ensuring their wellbeing and security. Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan also interacted with over 1000 LPG distributors through VC and asked them to maximise free Ujjwala refills for benefit of poor.


    To protect the interests of the poor during the lockdown period, a Rs 1.7 lakh crore relief package under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana was announced last month by the Government of India.Under this, the Union Government is crediting Rs 500 into the Jan Dhan Accounts of women beneficiaries, providingadditionalfoodgrains to the poor, giving free gas cylinders to beneficiaries of PM Ujjwala Yojana etc. for three months starting April. While talking about their experience, the beneficiariesin the states of Haryana, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh expressed satisfaction with its functioning.


    Anjali from Faridabad in Haryana expressed gratitude towards the Government of India as she has received additional ration and a free gas cylinder. Before lockdown, she has been working as a domestic maid. A daily wager, Imtiaz Ali from Chandigarh said due to lockdown there is no earning as it is difficult to find work during these times. The ration provided under PMGKY has come as a big relief for him and his family adding that it is a good initiative. While Balo from Chamba in Himachal Pradesh said she has received Rs 500 in her Jan Dhan Account and it will be a big help to her.
