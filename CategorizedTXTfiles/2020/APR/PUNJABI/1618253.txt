    The Government of India has extended relaxations in the category of private and commercial establishment under the consolidated revised guidelines to fight COVID-19, allowing opening of all shops registered under Shops & Establishment Act of respective States/ UTs. These include shops in residential complexes, neighbourhood & standalone shops in areas not included in hotspots/containment zones. The order, issued by Ministry of Home Affairs, while making distinction of relaxations between rural and urban areas clarified that all shops in rural areas, except those in shopping malls, are allowed to open. Whereas all standalone shops, neighbourhood shops & shops in residential complexes in urban areas are allowed to open, except those in markets/market complexes and shopping malls.
    Those shops like restaurants, salons and barber shops providing services would remain closed as relaxations pertain only to shops selling items. The e-commerce companies will continue to be permitted for essential goods only while the sale of liquor and other items continues to be prohibited as specified in the National Directives for COVID-19 management.
    The order complements the efforts of the Government of India to bring relief to the public reeling under the lockdown till 3rd May, 2020. As agricultural season at its full swing in the region especially in states of Haryana and Punjab, permitted manufacturing activities have also resumed and workers involved are complying with the necessary precautions while on work. No doubt it has provided succour to the workers like Baldev. Based in Haryana, he expressed gratitude to the Government of India as it has enabled him to get back to work spending his time productively.

    As agricultural and related activities are also allowed, it is a reassuring sight as wheat procurement is in full swing in the grain markets of Punjab. Coach building work has also started at Kapurthala Railway Coach Factory with 50% workforce working in shifts taking prescribed precautions.

    To ensure that no one is left behind in Indiaâ€™s fight against COVID-19, the Government of India announced a relief package under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana last month to help the poor to cope up with the effects of lockdown. Madhu, a beneficiary of relief package, of Panchkula said she has received a LPG cylinder under Ujjwala Yojana. She also said her husband who has not been able to earn his daily wage thanking the Government for the needed help.
