    Chandigarh, April 29,2020
    Economic activities have resumed in the region as the relaxations provided under revised consolidated guidelines are coming into action. As a relief measure during lockdown, a number of activities like inter and intra state movements of goods, agricultural and horticultural activities, cold storage & warehousing activities etc. are ensuring the continuity of economic activities across the country. This shows the Government’s importance to the economy as well as continuation of its fight against COVID-19. While it has proved as big support for agriculturists the subsequent orders for opening of book shops, electrical shops, shops under shops & establishment act of respective States/ UTs are helping households dependent on these activities. All these relaxations are applicable across the country except in containment zones in hotspot districts.
    The customers in Jind District in Haryana are relieved as the central government allows opening up of more categories of shops especially electrical goods and stationery in the green zones. A customer said that reopening of electrical shops will be helpful in summer season. While supporting the reopening of shops for non-essential commodities in outskirts, another customer said people should not come out unless it is important. Expressing his gratitude to the Government of India, a shopkeeper in Haryana said it will help him spend his time productively.

    The government agencies like Border Roads Organisation (BRO) are also ensuring that hilly and remote areas receive essential items at this crucial time. In a relief to Lahaul-Spiti valley residents, the strategic Rohtang Pass on the Manali-Leh road in Himachal Pradesh has been thrown open, three weeks ahead of the normal schedule. Resumption of construction activities have also been a great help to labourers.

    As economic activities resuming and agricultural season at full swing, the poor are supported by a relief package under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana. It was announced last month to help poor to cope up with effects of lockdown. The government of India has also launched “Aarogya Setu” app which enable people to assess themselves the risk of their catching the Corona Virus infection.
