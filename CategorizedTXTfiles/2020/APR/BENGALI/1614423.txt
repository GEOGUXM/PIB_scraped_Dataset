      In a bid to help poor and low wage earning EPF members fight the battle against coronavirus, the Central Government, as part of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMJKY), proposed to grant relief in form of credit of EPF & EPS contributions (24% of wages) for three months in UANs of contributory EPF members, earning monthly wage of less than Rs.15000/-.
      To implement the above package, the Ministry of Labour, Govt. of India has notified a Scheme specifying the objective, eligibility criteria, validity period, process and manner to avail the relief. The EPFO has put in place an electronic mechanism as part of the Electronic Challan-cum-Return (ECR) filing to enable the establishments to avail the relief in respect of their eligible employees.
      The employer in relation to any eligible establishment, shall disburse wages for the month to all employees of the establishment and file Electronic Challan cum Return (ECR) with required certificate and declaration to avail the benefit under the Scheme.
      After ECR is uploaded and eligibility of establishment and employees is validated, then the challan will separately show amount of employees’ and employers’ contributions due as Central Government relief in respect of eligible employees and the remaining amount payable by the employer.
      After the employer remits the payment due from him as reflected in challan, the EPF & EPS contributions will be credited directly in the UANs of the eligible employees of the establishment by the Central Govt.
      The details of the Scheme and FAQs containing clarifications on various aspects of the package are available on homepage of EPFO website under the TAB “COVID-19”
