    After conforming to all protocols and norms set by the central government for opening shops and start their businesses around 50-60 motor vehicles repairing shops and few dhabas have started functioning along the 115 km stretch of NH34 i.e from Boro Jaguli to Polasi. Shop owners in Krishnanagar, one of the biggest towns in this long stretch of highway, have expressed their utter satisfaction for providing permission by the central government. This highway is the only lifeline between North Eastern States and North Bengal with the southern part of the state of West Bengal. During the lockdown period the trucks carrying essential commodities as well as the ambulances had to face immense difficulties for non-availability of mechanics if by chance the vehicle had faced any mechanical snag. Now after the government order this problem is likely to be solved.


    It may be mentioned that considering the immense financial difficulties being faced by the traders and businessmen due to nationwide lockdown, Central Government has permitted to open shops and to start their business operations in non-hotspot or non-containment areas. However this permission is not at all unconditional. Traders and businessmen opening shops under these relaxations have to compulsorily follow social distancing while conduct of business. These shops are allowed to operate only with 50% of the registered staff. All staff-members will have to compulsorily wear face masks during operation of business / shop.
