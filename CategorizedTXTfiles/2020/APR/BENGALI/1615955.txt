      A portion of Viswabharati’s Pearson Hospital’s new complex has been earmarked for using as quarantine center for suspected corona patients. This is probably the first instance in the entire country where a part of university’s hospital has been converted to facilitate treatment for the corona suspects. Vice Chancellor of Viswa Bharati Prof. Bidyut Chakraborty stated this in Santinikatan today. He informed that initially a twenty bed set up has been prepared but in necessity it could be extended up to 60 bed center. He further stated that a fever clinic has also been made operational as per the guidelines issued time to time by the WHO and Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. This initiative has been taken to do away with the fear associated with having fever even from normal cough and cold.
      Prof Chakraborty also said that as they truly believe in Swami Vivekananda’s saying jeebey prem korey jei jon seijon sebichey isswar’ (Those who serve others serves the lord in true sense) they are practicing that too. Twice weekly relief package is being sent to the villages earmarked by the local administrative authorities. The relief material is procured with the amount accumulated through contribution by the teachers and staffs and well-wishers of Viswa Bharati. Apart from that the teachers and staff of this central university has contributed rupees 38 lakhs to the PM CARES fund.
