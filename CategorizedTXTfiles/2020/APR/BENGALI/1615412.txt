    As a precautionary measure to combat with COVID-19, South Eastern Railway (SER) is producing reusable Face Masks and Hand Sanitizer in its four divisions viz. Kharagpur, Adra, Ranchi and Chakradharpur as well as in Kharagpur Workshop. The masks and sanitizers are prepared under the strict supervision and guidance of Medical Department of SER.


    All the divisional units of SER and Kharagapur Workshop have geared up their machineries and have produced a total number of 68,694 reusable face masks and 3,640 litres of hand sanitizers so far.


    South Eastern Railway is trying its level best for running of freight and parcel express trains round the clock to ensure uninterrupted supply of essential commodities throughout the country. The reusable face masks and hand sanitizers are being distributed amongst the frontline employees like loco pilots, guards and concerned staff engaged in running of freight and parcel express trains to ensure their protection. It has also been planned to distribute mask and hand sanitizers to all employees of SER.


    Apart from the above, masks and sanitizers are also being sent to health units and hospitals over SER. Recently in-house production of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Kit has started at Kharagpur Workshop and Kharagpur Divisional Unit of SER to prevent infection of health care personnel during treatment of COVID-19 affected people.


    SERâ€™s in-house production will not only ensure timely supply of the masks, sanitizers and PPE to the frontline staff and health care personnel it will also ensure substantial cost saving.
