    South Eastern Railway (SER), considering the gravity of the situation due COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent lockdown and the necessity to go for uninterrupted supply of essential commodities to different places in the country, has already run 236 trips of Parcel Express Trains from 2 nd April to 20th April, 2020. During this period, SER has transported 2,710 tonnes of commodities containing 78361 numbers of packages to different places in the country. The essential items which were unloaded and loaded in the originating/terminating and at the intermediate stoppages were Medicines, Medical Equipment like PPEs, Masks & Sanitizers, Vegetables, Fish, Eggs, Grocery Items, Fruits, Flowers, Betel leaves, Cotton goods, Postal letters, Mosquito Curtains and many other hard & soft parcels for regular need.


    The plan of running Parcel Express trains received an overwhelming response from the traders, manufacturers, e-commerce companies and leaseholders to book their commodities by the Parcel Express Trains. This has become feasible only because of proper and effective planning taken by South Eastern Railway. Regular interaction with different Chambers of Commerce, direct contact with the traders to brief them about running of parcel express trains towards different parts of the country, regular meetings with the representatives of respective State Governments are the major factors to boost up the attitude of the traders to carry their commodities through railways.


    SER and its workforce is committed to fulfil the social responsibilities in this crisis moment.
