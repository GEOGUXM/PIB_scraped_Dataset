    In view of the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, South Eastern Railway (SER) is making all possible efforts to produce reusable Face Masks and Hand Sanitizer in its four divisions viz. Kharagpur, Adra, Ranchi and Chakradharpur along with the Kharagpur Workshop. The masks and sanitizer are prepared under the strict supervision and guidance of Medical Department of SER.


    All the divisional units of SER and Kharagapur Workshop have geared up their machineries for this and have produced a total number of 91800 reusable face masks and 5020 litres of hand sanitizer so far.


    SER is trying its level best for running of freight and parcel express trains round the clock to ensure uninterrupted supply of essential commodities throughout the country. The reusable face masks and hand sanitizer are distributed amongst the frontline employees like loco pilots, guards and concerned staff engaged in running of freight and parcel express trains to ensure their protection. It has also been planned to distribute mask and hand sanitizer to all employees of SER.


    This apart, masks and sanitizer are also being sent to health units and hospitals over SER. Recently in-house production of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Kit has been started at Kharagpur Workshop and Kharagpur Divisional Unit of SER to prevent infection of health care personnel during treatment of COVID-19 affected people.


    SERâ€™s in-house production not only ensures timely supply of the masks, sanitizers and PPEs to the frontline staff and health care personnel, it also ensures substantial cost savings.
