    The Ministry of Tourism, Government of India launched the ‘Stranded in India’ portal on 31st March, 2020 for international tourists. In its first two days itself it has received more than 500 queries/ requests for help.


    The ministry is coordinating assistance to tourists with joint effort and support of the Ministry of External Affairs and state officials to address these queries. The Ministry has also been coordinating with the respective embassies regarding problems faced by the guests.


    The majority of the requests received from foreign tourists are seeking information for traveling back to their home countries and also looking at extension of the visas to stay in India following the national lockdown.


    The other issue being faced by tourists traveling within India is to reach metro cities like Delhi and Mumbai from where flights can be taken out of India once lockdown lifts..


    The Hotels and Restaurant Division of the Ministry has been in constant touch with several hotels, which are accommodating guests during the lock down and coordinating with the respective embassies regarding problems faced by the guests, if any. Hotels are being requested to follow the protocol and extend their support till the departure of such guests are arranged by the embassies.


    Ministry of Tourism has setup a task force to address the issues being brought forward in real time.
