    The Covid 19 Fact Check Unit at the Press Information Bureau, New Delhi has become operational. It will receive messages by email at pibfactcheck@gmail.com and send response in a defined time-frame. The official version of any news on Covid-19 can be obtained from this Unit. It is being headed by a Director General level officer of the Indian Information Service.


    Furthermore, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has set up a Technical Group consisting of professionals from AIIMS, to clarify any doubts in the minds of the general public on any technical aspect of COVID 19.


    It may be recalled that the Supreme Court of India had yesterday directed the Media, including print, electronic and social media, to maintain a strong sense of responsibility and ensure that unverified news capable of causing panic is not disseminated.
