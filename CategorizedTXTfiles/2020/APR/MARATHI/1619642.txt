    The number of COVID-19 positive cases stands at 33,050 as on date, while 23,651 people are under active medical supervision as on today. 8,324 people have been cured till date, which takes up the recovery rate to 25.19%. In the last 24 hours, 630 recoveries and 67 deaths have been reported. This was informed by the Joint Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Shri Lav Agarwal, at the daily media briefing on the actions taken, preparedness and updates on COVID-19, held at Shastri Bhawan, PIB New Delhi today. Stating this, the Joint Secretary said, recovery rate has improved from 13.06% 14 days back, to more than 25% today, which is a very positive sign.


    The Joint Secretary further said, analysis of deaths so far, show that case fatality rate is 3.2%; 65% of deaths were of males and 35% of the deceased were females. A study of the age distribution of deaths shows that 14% deaths occurred in the age–group of below 45 years, 34.8% in the age group 45 to 60 years and 51.2% in those aged above 60 years. Further, 42% of deaths occurred in the age-group of 60-75 years, while 9.2% of the deaths have been recorded in above 75 years age group. It is important to note that when it comes to COVID-19, both age and co-morbidities are risk factors, stated the Joint Secretary.


    The Joint Secretary informed that national average of doubling time has gone up to 11 days now, while it was 3.4 days before lockdown. Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, J&K, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Punjab have recorded doubling time between 10-20 days; Karnataka, Ladakh, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Kerala have a doubling time between 20-40 days; and Assam, Telengana, Chhattisgarh and Himachal Pradesh have a doubling time which is more than 40 days.


    The Joint Secretary stated:

      * Health Ministry has written to states asking them to ensure that non-COVID-19 essential services continue to be provided to those who need them.
      * Health Ministry has prepared a Standard Operating Protocol for dialysis services , in the wake of COVID-19.
      * Health Minister has written to state Health Ministers on ensuring adequate availability of blood transfusion services, especially for patients needing regular blood transfusion .
      * COVID19 tests prescribed by any health facility should be as per protocol. Treatment should not be denied to any patient, citing requirement of additional testing beyond what is prescribed in the testing protocol .
      * Health Ministry has issued guidelines regarding measures to be undertaken if a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case is detected in a non-COVID health facility . Services can be continued in such health facilities after due disinfection procedure.
      * Healthcare service providers should take necessary precautions for personal protection and use PPE rationally as per guidelines.
      * Guidelines for infection prevention and control in healthcare facilities should also be followed in every way.
      * A detailed advisory has been issued on the use of Hydroxy-Chloroquine as prophylaxis (preventive treatment) for SARS-COV2 infection. Sufficient availability of HCQ should be ensured.

    The Joint Secretary informed that RT-PCR testing capacity in the country has been progressively scaled up. “We now have 292 government labs and 97 private laboratories for COVID-19 testing across the country. As many as 58,686 tests were done yesterday. 49,800 tests per day have been done on an average during the last 5 days. We have been continuously scaling up our testing capacity, it is being ensured that all people who need to be tested as per testing protocol are getting tested.”


    On a question regarding whether the lockdown will be extended, Shri Aggarwal said: “Health Ministry is very clear that we have to make physical distancing a part of our life, as a behaviour change. Along with that, it is equally important to focus on containment measures, in order to break the chain of transmission.”


    Regarding the effectiveness of remdesivir in treating COVID-19, the Joint Secretary informed: “As of now, there is no confirmed treatment protocol for COVID-19. Remdesivir is one of the various protocols which are being examined. Even the study on remdesivir by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, USA has not conclusively proved the effectiveness of the drug in curing COVID-19. We are waiting for larger evidence to take meaningful action at the field level.”


    On a question regarding vaccine development for COVID-19, the Joint Secretary updated: “Multiple organizations in multiple Ministries of the government are engaged in multiple vaccine trials for COVID-19. We are also part of WHO’s Solidarity Trial. Some candidate vaccines have been identified. However, nothing conclusive has come up. Multiple stages have to be passed, to conclude safe and efficacious use of a vaccine by human beings. As far as India is concerned, we have identified Hydroxychloroquine to begin with as a prophylaxis treatment.”


    The Joint Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs Ms. Punya Salila Srivastava briefed that:

      * MHA has issued an order allowing movement of persons (including students, migrant labourers, tourists, pilgrims, etc.) stranded at different places of the country. The state governments will have to appoint nodal authorities and have to devise an SOP for movement of such persons.
      * The Inter Ministerial Central Team visiting Hyderabad visited hospitals, central drug stores, shelter homes, mandis etc. They found that the state has adequate number of testing kits and PPE kits. The State Government is using an end-to-end dashboard for tracking patients right from testing up to their discharge. They also visited Gandhi Hospital which is the state nodal centre for COVID-19. The Central team found that all treatment and discharge protocols are being followed in this hospital. This hospital has provided treatment to more than 93% of cases in the state and its laboratory can perform 300 tests on a daily basis. After treatment, the hospital vehicle drops patients at their residence and mobile messages about 14 days home quarantine are delivered to patients. The team also visited King Koti District Hospital. There also all protocols are being adhered to and the team found that facility for sample collection is available in the district hospital. IMCT advised that the donning and doffing areas in the hospital should be situated away from one another, there should be separate corridors for hospital staff and patients. Some wards didn't have attached toilets. The team has suggested that patients should not be admitted in these wards, so that gathering at a common corridor may be prevented. The team has visited Humayun Nagar containment zone which has been barricaded. House-to-house survey is being carried out over there. Nigam staff are providing essential items and services at doorsteps in containment zones, for which a WhatsApp group of Nigam staff and residents of containment zones has been started. Police are using drones for surveillance at some areas. The team visited quarantine centres and found them to be satisfactory. They also viewed the stock monitoring system of Central Drug Stores, which monitors the available medicine stocks of district hospitals and sub-district hospitals in real time. They visited a shelter home, where meals and essential items are being provided. My GHMC app can be used for information on food cures. Municipal Corporation has arranged for mobile food vans which provide meals to old-age homes, night shelters, orphanages and trans-gender people. The central team found that lockdown is being successfully implemented in most of the places and community leaders also have a contribution in it. Though social distancing is being followed in most of the places, they found some construction labourers without masks in some sites. They have brought this matter to the notice of local authorities and advised that labourers' health check-up should be done on a regular basis.
      * Inter Ministerial Central Team at Chennai reviewed control rooms, call centre facilities, helplines of different departments, containment zones, quarantine centres, COVID and non-COVID hospitals, PDS shops, banks, medical shops, children's homes, old-age homes, fishermen hutments, slums, relief camps, inter-state and inter-district borders. They also held discussions with various stake-holders. Recovery rate in Tamil Nadu is quite good, 57% people have been cured. Relief camps for migrant workers have good facilities and the workers are happy with it. Facilities for television, medical check-up and counselling also exist. Canteens are arranging for three meals a day for people during lockdown. People are being provided financial assistance, free ration and kits containing essential items, at subsidised rate. Mobile sample collection vans are working so that movement of people can be restricted. Test reports are given in 24 hours which has been praised by the Central team. COVID tele-counselling centre and contact tracing centre are also functioning in a good manner. In COVID hospitals, doctors speak with patients through video conferencing also. State Government has also taken steps against domestic violence. On the basis of police records, lady constables visit houses where domestic violence may take place, to prevent it. IMCT has advised the state government to take stricter steps to implement social distancing at crowded places, slums and banks. It is necessary to create more awareness about COVID-19 in fishermen’s villages. Social distancing needs to be implemented in hospital lifts amongst patients’ relatives. It is required to increase the use of PPE among health care workers. Truck drivers are also to be screened.
