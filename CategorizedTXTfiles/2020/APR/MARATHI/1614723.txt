    Total 1.39 crore cylinders have been booked under this Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana scheme so far and 97.8 Lakh free cylinders already delivered to beneficiaries. The delivery of cylinders is taking place unhindered during the lock down period.


    As part of the Rs 1.72 crore relief package announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to deal with the economic impact of the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of corona virus.


    Savitri Shivkumar Dikshit, a resident of district Akola says the decision to give 3 gas cylinders free and also 5 kg of foodgrains per month go a long way in mitigating the hardship of poor in rural areas. Such moves would help people to stay at home and make lockdown a success.
