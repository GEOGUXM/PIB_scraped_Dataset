In the last 24 hours, 1,211 new cases, 31 deaths and recovery of 179 persons have been reported. This was informed by the Joint Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Shri Luv Aggarwal, at the daily media briefing on the actions taken, preparedness and updates on COVID-19, held at National Media Centre, PIB New Delhi today. He further stated that 602 dedicated COVID Hospitals with 1,06,719 isolation beds and 12,024 ICU beds have been prepared, in coordination with states. This number is being augmented continuously.


    Referring to the Prime Minister’s address to the nation, in which he announced extension of the nation-wide lockdown till May 3, 2020 , Shri Aggarwal recalled that:

      * PM has stated that India adopted a holistic and integrated approach to managing COVID-19, taking quick and decisive action with an attempt to nip the problem in the bud rather than waiting for the problem to aggravate
      * PM also said in his address to the nation today, that the collective strength of our people so far has been a true tribute to Baba Saheb Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar.
      * PM has asked the nation to follow seven steps in order to fight COVID-19.
      * PM has assured that all the efforts have been made by the Government of India to ensure ample reserve of medicines, food, ration and other essential goods.

    As mentioned by the PM, Shri Aggarwal further informed that each city and every district will undergo an evaluation till April 20, 2020. As per the litmus test, selected activities will be allowed from April 20, 2020, in the areas which have controlled the situation well. A detailed guideline will be issued tomorrow by the Government of India.


    Quoting WHO’s data of 76,498 confirmed cases and 5,702 deaths across the world yesterday, the Joint Secretary said, “It is due to our collective efforts that in a large country like India, we had only 1,211 positive cases and 31 deaths reported in the last 24 hours”. He exhorted everyone to keep up the battle and diligently follow government guidelines and social distancing and lockdown measures. He added that the government’s effort has been to act in pre-emptive manner. “We started screening 12 - 13 days before COVID-19 has been declared as a public health emergency. Our advance action has been a major contributory factor in how we have been able to manage COVID-19.”


    Shri Agarwal further stated:

      * Principal Scientific Advisor to Government of India has issued guidelines for controlling spread of COVID-19 in densely populated areas, such as Dharavi in Mumbai . The guideline suggests frugal sanitation and hygiene solutions for community toilets and washing and bathing facilities.

    Through a video presentation, Health Ministry highlighted as to how a dedicated COVID Hospital has been set up at AIIMS, New Delhi. The institute has around 270 isolation beds, and more than 150 ICU beds. The Trauma Centre and Burns & Plastic Surgery Block have been used to form a part of the COVID Hospital. When a patient enters the hospital, he or she is first sent to the holding area. Those who experience coughing are provided with masks and are kept in that hall, ensuring that distancing norms are followed. At Triage Stage-1 part of the COVID Hospital, a patient’s temperature, history and saturation are checked, based upon which it is decided as to whether the patient requires hospital care. The patients who require further investigation are then transferred to Triage Stage 2 where doctors, nurses and para-medics are available. The patient’s clinical examination is done there and vital parameters are taken. Serious patients are sent to the red zone of the hospital.


    Answering a media query, Shri Aggarwal stated that those who with symptoms may approach national / state helpline centres or frontline workers such as ASHA workers. Field workers have been oriented about the process to be followed, so that they can help in early detection and facilitate proper treatment in hospitals.


    Replying to a query on demographic profile of COVID-19 cases in India, he said that old age and comorbidity are found to be the two main risk factors; while young too are getting infected, the cure rate among them is high. Responding to a question on testing, He informed that COVID-19 testing is being done as per our sampling criteria; non-criteria-based testing can result in sub-optimal use of testing kits. Besides, we are progressively widening our sampling zone, we are testing those who have SARI or influenza-like illnesses, he informed.
