    TRAVELING AUDIO ANNOUNCEMENT AWARENESS CAMPAIGN:


    ROB has also launched a traveling audio announcement campaign in rural areas of Maharashtra and Goa using thematic three wheelers/ auto rickshaws/ tempos with pre-recorded Corona songs and messages. The audio messaging is primarily focused on various preventive measures and initiatives taken by the government to contain the spread of COVID-19. In order to make messaging more effective, the songs are made in local languages and dialects.


    The campaign was launched across 16 Covid-19 affected districts of Maharashtra & Goa, viz : Pune, Parbhani, Nasik, Nanded, Latur, Solapur, Satara, Osmanabad, Kolhapur, Jalgaon, Amravati, Aurangabad, Buldhana, Ahmednagar, Beed & south Goa.
