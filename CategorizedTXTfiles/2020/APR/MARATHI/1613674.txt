    The total number of COVID-19 cases in the country stands at 8,356 as on date. A total of 273 people in the country have died because of the COVID-2019 infection. In the last 24 hours, 909 new cases and 34 deaths have been reported. A total of 716 people have recovered and have been discharged and 74 people have been cured since yesterday. This was informed by the Joint Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Shri Luv Aggarwal, at the daily media briefing on the actions taken, preparedness and updates on COVID-19, held at National Media Centre, PIB New Delhi today. Though number of COVID-19 cases has increased from 979 on March 29, 2020 to 8,356 today, the number of patients requiring oxygen support or critical care is around 20%. Assuring that the Government is over-prepared in managing the situation, he said that there is no need for panic.


    The Joint Secretary further informed that the Government is working on an urgent basis to expand the capacity for COVID-19 testing in Government and private medical colleges across the country. Detailed discussions in this regard have been held at the level of Health Minister and Home Minister. To expand testing capacity, the Government has identified 14 mentor institutes including institutions of international repute such as AIIMS and NIMHANS. These institutes will mentor other government and private medical colleges and help expand the capacity. He also informed that the government’s efforts at present are focussed on proper clinical management of positive patients, contact tracing and fool-proof implementation of containment strategy.


    Shri Aggarwal assured the public that the government is taking adequate measures to expand the capacity of Dedicated COVID Hospitals and isolation beds in the country. Giving a presentation on the progress in setting up dedicated COVID hospitals , the Joint Secretary informed that proper mapping of patients to care centres is being done, so that patients are given treatment depending on the severity of the disease and are transferred to different types of care centres capable of providing more intensive care, as required. Comparing the demand and supply of hospital beds, he informed that while 196 or around 20% of positive cases on March 29 required critical care or oxygen support, around 42,000 dedicated COVID beds were available. As on date, while 1,671 beds are required, we have more than 1.05 lakh dedicated COVID-19 beds in 601 dedicated COVID hospitals, he informed. He said that the government is increasing the number of dedicated hospitals and isolation beds, and that it is prepared in dealing with the situation, even to the extent of being over-prepared. He added that adequate focus is being given also on properly orienting our health staff on various aspects of COVID-19 management, so that they don't face any problems at field level. Trainings are being organized since last two months. A Special Medical Officer is being appointed for every dedicated hospital. Availability of all required equipment is being ensured in coordination with states.


    The Joint Secretary gave a snapshot of the dedicated COVID hospitals being set up at various places across the country. AIIMS, Delhi has around 250 beds, including 70 ventilator beds.

Indian Railways is working on converting 20,000 coaches into isolation coaches, out of which 5,000 coaches are being converted in the first phase.

He once again requested the cooperation of all citizens in this battle, especially through following social distancing norms – which he reiterated is the social vaccine in the fight against COVID-19.

He also said that the recent resurgence of cases in China, Japan and Korea is a cause of concern for us too; he said that we should therefore ensure that we continue to follow our containment and social distancing measures.
