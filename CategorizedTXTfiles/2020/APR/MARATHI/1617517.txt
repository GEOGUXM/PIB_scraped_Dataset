    News reports have been published that the Inter Ministerial Central Team (IMCT), during its visit to Mumbai has projected Corona virus cases in the city to reach 42,604 by April 30th and 6.5 lakh by mid May.


    It is clarified that no such projections have been made by the IMCT. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai has also issued a statement saying no such projections were put forward by the Central Team during their meetings with the Municipal Commissioner or any other senior official of the Municipal authority.


    As can be seen from the projections, it appears to be based on a hypothetical mathematical model calculated at a doubling rate of 3.8 days. The current doubling rate in Mumbai has increased to 7.1 days. Maharashtra Health Minister Shri Rajesh Tope has also stated that the state government has increased surveillance, screening, testing and treatment in a bid to arrest the Covid 19 outbreak and cited the encouraging results emanating from Worli -Koliwada containment zone.

    Replying to a question about Covid cases in Mumbai during the 4 p.m briefing at the National Media Centre, New Delhi today, the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare spokesperson Luv Agarwal stated that besides the Rapid Response Team, two other Central teams are currently working with the Government of Maharashtra. He said in a collaborative effort with the state government, preparatory activities are drawn up taking into account best case scenario, average and worst case scenarios. Centre has already asked the state government to augment institutional quarantine facilities in dense slum pockets and also ramp up its contact tracing programme in slum areas.
