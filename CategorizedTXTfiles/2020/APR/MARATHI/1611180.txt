      Posted On: 04 APR 2020 8:26PM by PIB Mumbai


    Responding to the challenges faced by the Exporters during lockdown to obtain Certificate of Origin (CoO), the Federation of Indian Exports Organization under the Ministry of Commerce has introduced the facility of issuing digital certificate of origin (both non-preferential and preferential, for which it is authorized) through its online system.


    The facility is expected to reduce the transaction time and cost to exporters. Such a facility will help exporters to send CoO electronically to buyers to help them clear the consignment particularly as most of the courier companies are not operating in the country. Many of the countries are now accepting scanned /digital copies of the Certificate of Origins.


    FIEO is also updating information relating to Covid-19, having bearing on exports/imports, at its website under the banner "Updates on Covid-19". It has urged exporters/importers to access it to update themselves on a real-time basis.
