      Central Railway plays the good Samaritan amidst Covid crisis
      Posted On: 29 APR 2020 4:00PM by PIB Mumbai


    In an incident that required some quick thinking, the Central Railway managed to help a heart patient from Chiplun to get the much required medicines shipped from Mumbai. The Central Railway Parcel Office collected the medicine parcel from Vikhroli and booked it on the Okha-Ernakulam Parcel Train. Though, the train did not have a scheduled halt at Chiplun, the staff coordinated with Konkan Railway authorities and requested a brief halt to drop the parcel, which was then handed over the Chiplun Station Master.


    In yet another similar incident, Central Railway had helped transport camel milk from Falna in Rajasthan to Secunderabad, that was much required for a child under special treatment.


    Amidst nation wide lockdown, when passenger services have remained suspended, the parcel and freight trains have moved across the country transporting food grains, perishable food items, medicines etc. Central Railway alone has transported 283 tonnes of medical items during the lockdown. It has already run 180 time tabled parcel trains and 40 more are scheduled. Mumbai, Pune, Solapur, Bhusaval and Nagpur divisions have worked relentlessly during Indiaâ€™s battle against Corona virus.


    Other units of Central Railway have also pitched in with their own contribution. The Parel and Matunga Railway Workshops have manufactured over 13,000 masks and 1,600 litres of sanitizers for use of the railway staff and other frontline workers. More than a century old Kalyan Railway School joined in voluntarily preparing masks and sanitziers.
