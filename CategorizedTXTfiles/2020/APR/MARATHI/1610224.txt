      Make masks at home to overcome shortage
      Posted On: 02 APR 2020 1:41PM by PIB Mumbai


    With the outbreak of Covid 19, shortage of face masks and hand sanitizers has become a stark reality. As anxious public frantically shop for hygiene products, in particular mask and hand sanitizers, the sudden increased demand has met with shortage of supply.


    Shops and services are demanding that the customers use face mask. In some shops the patrons are denied services for not using the face mask. Many health experts are also suggesting that use of face mask in public spaces could reduce the spread of infection. Wearing of masks is especially recommended for people living in densely populated areas.


    To overcome the situation, the Office of the Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India on Tuesday issued the manual on homemade masks: The guide is meant to provide a simple outline of best practices to make, use and reuse masks to enable NGOs and individuals to self-create such masks and accelerate widespread adoption of masks across India. The key criteria for proposed designs are Ease of Access to Materials, Easy of Making at Home, Ease of Use and Reuse.


    Universal usage of Home Made Masks is also expected to reduce demand for N-95 and N-99 masks, which are mainly meant for frontline healthcare workers battling Covid 19.
