    With new guidelines on lockdown setting agriculture and allied activities almost completely free, rural areas are expected to witness increase in farm related activities.


    To help the small and marginal farmers to tide over the lock down, the Finance Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman had announced direct transfer of 1st instalment of Pradhan Mantrr Kisan Samman Nidhi in early April.


    The PM-KISAN scheme aims to supplement the financial needs of the SMFs in procuring various inputs to ensure proper crop health and appropriate yields, commensurate with the anticipated farm income at the end of the each crop cycle. An amount of Rs 6,000 is credited directly in the beneficiaryâ€™s account in three equal instalments of Rs 2,000 each.


    The Centre has till date disbursed an amount of Rs 14,946 crores benefitting 7.47 crore small and marginal farmers.


    A marginal farmer from Akot in Akola district of Maharashtra says, the first instalment of Rs 2,000 he has received in his account has come in handy during the lock down period.
