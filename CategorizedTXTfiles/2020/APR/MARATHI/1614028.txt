Informing about one positive development at field level which shows the result of the efforts of our frontline workers, Shri Aggarwal stated that in 25 districts from 15 states, no additional positive case has been reported for the last 14 days, while positive cases were reported there before.


    Highlighting need to use technology for prompt response, the Joint Secretary said that the government is using technology for live case tracking, case management and for implementation and monitoring of containment plan.

    Shri Aggarwal showed the example of Bengaluru to highlight effective management of COVID-19 using technology. In Bengaluruâ€™s COVID-19 War Room, software engineers, doctors, pilots, research scholars, psychologists, Red Cross workers and common citizens are collectively fighting against COVID-19. All callers are given important information through helplines which are manned from here. Government, start-ups and academic institutions have come together to form a platform, which is managed in the war-room; the platform provides real-time updates on positive cases, suspected cases and graphs of the evolving situation at taluka and district levels. Hunger Helpline number 155214 for serving migrant workers and poor people is also operated from the war room. War room has also been working to bust fake news about COVID-19. Bengaluru Municipal Commissioner Office also has a unit functioning from the war room. Heat maps, identification and classification of hotspots based on isolation period and other such important works are carried out by the joint efforts of government officers and workers from private sector. In Bengaluru, those advised quarantine have to download Quarantine App which is GPS-enabled and requires patients to send a selfie every day. Corona Watch App tracks all positive cases. Corona Watch App informs people about their proximity to any positive patient. This multifaceted COVID-19 War Room, which leverages technology to help take superior decisions, has enabled Karnataka to control spread of COVID-19 to a large extent, the Joint Secretary informed.

      * The Ministry has clarified that both inter-state and intra-state movement of trucks and goods carriers are allowed, whether or not goods are essential. No separate permit or approval is required for cargo movement. Empty trucks or goods carriers are also allowed - since they may be going for pickup of goods or returning after delivery. Along with driver, one more person is allowed in the goods carrier. Local authorities have been asked to proactively facilitate the truck driver and cleaner of trucks to travel from their homes to the truck location.
      * Local authorities are required to cooperate and facilitate the movement of workers of those organizations which have received permission to undertake official or commercial activities during lockdown.
      * Railways, airports, sea ports and customs authorities have been authorized to issue passes for their staff and contractual labourers. They should ensure these passes are issued.
      * States and UTs need to issue passes to workers of those firms which are exempted from lockdown restrictions. They should also ensure that manufacturing units near state borders too do not face any hurdles in functioning.
      * Workers belonging to the MSME sector who are employed in supply of essential items such as wheat flour ( atta ), pulses ( dal ) and edible oil should not face any hurdles. Warehouses and cold storages too should be allowed to operate, whether or not these are for essential items.
      * These instructions are applicable to all areas except hot spots and containment areas.
      * Social Distancing norms and proper hygiene should be maintained while performing all these activities. States have been told to ensure that these instructions reach all district authorities and field level agencies.

    The Ministry informed these measures will help ensure that there is no shortage of essential commodities and services during the lockdown.


    The representative of ICMR Dr. Raman R. Gangakhedkar informed that a total of 2,06,212 tests have been done so far. He further informed that 14 mentor institutes have been identified for augmenting testing capacity in the country ; these institutes will train other medical colleges and also examine whether new labs need to be set up. Assuring that sufficient testing kits are available, he informed that based on current stock and testing trends, we can test easily for six more weeks.


    Replying to a media query on recently reported study on use of the drug Remdesivir for COVID-19 treatment, Dr. Gangakhedkar said that it is not a clinical trial, but only an observational study. He said that we will come to know of further developments through WHO Solidarity Trial, which has an arm that is looking into the matter.


    Responding to another media query on a study which says that COVID-19 infection can be transmitted through shoes, Dr. Gangakhedkar stated that strength of evidence is of paramount importance in science. Stating that a very big piece of evidence is required to accept this conclusion, he said that the proposition cannot be accepted based on just one report.


    The Principal Director General of Press Information Bureau, Shri K.S.Dhatwalia, informed:

      * Indian Railways has been continuing to feed the infrastructure sector and ramp up the supply chain during the COVID-19 lockdown. From 1st April to 11th April 2020, Railways has transported more than 1.9 lakh wagons of coal and over 13000 wagons of petroleum products.
