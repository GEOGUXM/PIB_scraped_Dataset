    New Delhi / Mumbai, April 9, 2020


    The number of COVID-19 cases stands at 5,734 as on date. A total of 166 people in the country have died because of the COVID-2019 infection. In the last 24 hours, 540 new cases and 17 deaths have been reported. 473 people have recovered so far. This was informed by the Joint Secretary, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Shri Luv Aggarwal, at the daily media briefing on the actions taken, preparedness and updates on COVID-19, held at National Media Centre, PIB New Delhi today.


    The Joint Secretary further informed that order has been placed for 1.7 crore PPE and 49,000 ventilators, based on which supply has started to come. 20 domestic manufacturers have been developed to supply PPE. Shri Aggarwal further noted, “There is a feeling of fear being created that PPEs are not enough; we must understand that PPEs are not required for everyone, as per guidelines issued earlier. PPE must be used based on risk profile, its use at field-level should be as per the defined process and guidelines. What is important is that PPEs are used rationally for the right purpose and where it is needed”. He clarified that PPE is not only cover-all - it is a mix of different components. All components are required only in high-risk zones, such as in labs where test samples are collected, in emergency rooms and in mortuary-related activities. In other zones, N95 masks and gloves will be sufficient. Reiterating that the Government is making efforts to provide sufficient stock to states, he reminded that it is also necessary that PPE is used in a rational and optimal manner, for the right purpose.


    About supply of Hydroxychloroquin (HCQ), the Joint Secretary briefed that the nation has made proper preparation and planning regarding current and future requirement of hydroxychloroquine. The current stock is more than enough and Government is 100% prepared to meet emergent needs, he further said. He highlighted also that hydroxychloroquine should be used as per norms. “HCQ is to be given only to contacts and doctors dealing with COVID-19 patients. It can be harmful to people suffering from cardiac diseases or irregularities. It should be used only by the specified categories of people.”
