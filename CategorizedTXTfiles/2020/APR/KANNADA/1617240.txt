    Activities under MGNREGA have started in several parts of the state. Such jobs have been initiated post the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs on 15th April 2020. These works are allowed during lockdown as per the guidelines. The activities undertaken are supervised by Panchayat and district officials and strict precautions and protocols in wake of COVID-19 are being taken.


    The lockdown due to COVID-19 was extended till 3rd May 2020, by Honâ€™ble PM on 14th April 2020. The guidelines to be followed by the states in allowing essential services and activities were subsequently issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs which provided relaxation in certain essential activities, which included works under MGNREGA.


    To provide an impetus to the rural economy, industries operating in rural areas, including food processing industries; construction of roads, irrigation projects, buildings and industrial projects in rural areas; works under MGNREGA, with priority to irrigation and water conservation works; and operation of rural Common Service Centres (CSCs) have all been allowed during lockdown. These activities will create job opportunities for rural labor, including the migrant labor force.


    In light of the same jobs under MGNREGA have started in most of the districts of Karnataka. It is to be noted that proper precautions of social distancing, use of sanitizers before and after the completion of work, and early working hours are being properly maintained. Officials at the district and Panchayat level are giving utmost importance to creating awareness among the workers regarding the epidemic and instructing about the precautions to be maintained thereof.
