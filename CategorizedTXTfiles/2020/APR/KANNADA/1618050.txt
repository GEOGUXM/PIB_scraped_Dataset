    In a village called Madapura in Heggadevana Kote block of the district workers have begun construction work of cattle shed under MGNREG. Shri Raghavendra, team leader explains that personal construction work is taken up and the labourers are paid the wages according to the norms. In spite of the prevailing Corona virus atmosphere the District Administration has permitted to go ahead with personal construction activities under the scheme which is a boon to the labourers amidst the anxiety for daily bread.
