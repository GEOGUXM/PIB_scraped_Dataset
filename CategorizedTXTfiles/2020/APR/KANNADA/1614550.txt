      Posted On: 14 APR 2020 9:27PM by PIB Bengaluru


    In spite of COVID 19 playing its ghostly roll, the Mysore district farmers have dared enough to continue with their routine agricultural activities. They are set to fields as the pre kharif showers started since last week. Sowing of paddy seeds completed in about 8,000 acres in the district by mid March. This is astonishingly true to know that the farmers in Nanjangud tq, which is considered the hotspot of Corona virus, are also not lagging behind in their venture of agricultural activities.


    Sri. M.Mahanteshappa, Joint Director, Dept. of Agriculture, Mysore said that as the spring was approached the farmerâ€™s enthusiasm doubled leaving COVID worries behind.


    As the paddy sowing process is over for the year, now farmers are standing in rows, of course maintaining Social distance and putting on their cloth/masks to cover their T- Zone, to take pulses seeds, manures for sowing. Raitha Samparka Kendras are open in the district during fixed hours to cater the needs of the workers. The police are monitoring and helping the farmers maintain social distance at the Kendra while they take away their requirements. Farmers are thankful to Government for providing safety for their lives and also allowing them to carry on their life as usual.
