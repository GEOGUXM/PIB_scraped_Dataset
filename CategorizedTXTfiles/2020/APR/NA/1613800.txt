    Following is the full text of the message -


    “I convey my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of our country on the joyous occasion of ‘Vaisakhi, Vishu, Puthandu, Masadi, Vaishkhadi and Bahag Bihu’.


    These festivals which celebrate the birth of a new year, serve as harbingers of new beginnings and new hopes. Associated with harvests, these festivals celebrate the bounty and beauty of nature.


    As we pass through testing times when we battle the spectre of the Novel Coronavirus, it is festivals like these that rejuvenate our spirits and lend us guidance and direction.


    I pray that the coming year be one of abundance and that we not only strive to share this abundance but also endeavour to care for our fellow beings and mother nature. May the new year also inspire in us virtues of selflessness, kindness, compassion and empathy and usher in peace, harmony, prosperity and happiness in our lives.


    Let us celebrate this new year at home with our near and dear ones and stay away from mass gatherings and large celebrations.


    Stay Home, Stay Safe.”
