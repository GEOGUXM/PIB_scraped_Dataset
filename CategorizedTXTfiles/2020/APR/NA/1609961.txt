    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind in his message on the eve of Ram Navami has said: -


    “On the auspicious occasion of Ram Navami, I extend my greetings and best wishes to fellow citizens.


    Ramnavami, celebrated as the birth anniversary of Maryada Purushottam Shri Ram , is also an occasion for our toiling farmers to celebrate new crops. Shri Ram's ideal life gives us the message of virtue, tolerance, warmth and harmony. We should sincerely follow these eternal values in the course of our duty.


    On the festive occasion of Rama Navami, let us resolve to follow Shri Ram's ideals in our lives and to build a glorious nation. Also, follow all government guidelines including social distancing while celebrating the festival to combat and defeat the pandemic of COVID-19 virus.”
