     1. FACILITATION BY THE MARINE PRODUCTS EXPORT DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY (MPEDA) : MPEDA has started issuing most of the Certificates for exports online i.e. DS 2301 certificates for the USA market w.e.f.1st April 2020. This is an essential certificate for the export of shrimp to USA. By making it online, the physical movements for the exporters have reduced. Another Certificate (Asia -Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA) also has been made online after the lock down was introduced.

     1. Measures taken by Government e-market place (GeM) to facilitate procurement in view of the covid-19 pandemic


    The status of various interventions for ease of procurement for COVID-19 related items are as follows:

             1. New page introduced for tracking COVID-19 categories and the number of sellers.
             2. Shorter duration Bids with shorter delivery period enabled. Bid Cycle for COVID-19 related categories has been reduced to 3 days from existing 10 days. Buyers would also be able to reduce the Delivery Period for such items to 2 days considering the critical nature of the items.
             3. A filter has been put in for Local Supplier and for Lead Time for delivery selection by the buyer, to facilitate early delivery.
             4. Prioritization is being done in Product/Brand approval of the Covid Specific Categories.
             5. A new business rule has been put in place for controlling unreasonable price increase.
             6. Delivery Period Extension have been allowed for 30 days beyond the expiry of the original Delivery Period.
             7. New business rule to stock out sellers who do not update stock within 48 hours of notification for specific categories.
             8. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) & Sellers for eight new COVID categories have been identified.
             9. A Business Continuity Plan has been put in place for MSP and GeM to ensure continuity of system operations.

     1. MEASURES TAKEN BY DEPARTMENT TO FACILITATE PREFERENTIAL EXPORTS IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC


     1. In the wake of the lockdown, the agencies authorized to issue the certificates of origin for India’s preferential exports under the free trade agreement (FTAs) are either not functional or are operating with a skeletal staff. In the light of this, Department of Commerce had included some specific FTAs on this digital platform which had facilitated online application by exporters for these certificates. Trade Notice 1 dated 7.4.2020 has added India’s main FTAs namely those with ASEAN, Japan, SAARC countries and Asia Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA) onto this digital platform. A related Trade Notice 62 dated 6.4.2020 has asked the agencies to issue the digitally signed certificates to the exporters on this platform as also keep a uniform fee for certificates even if they are issued retrospectively. The platform issues digitally signed certificates and we have been successful in getting the trading partners to accept these digitally signed certificates. This would ensure that our preferential exports are facilitated even during this lockdown period.


     1. Most of the exporters to the European Union (EU) avail of the EU Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) Scheme wherein they get tariff preferences on exports. While the EU GSP is on a self certification basis, the exporters have to apply to the prescribed agencies in India for getting a REX (registered exporter) number. In view of the closure of the offices of these agencies, Trade Notice 61 dated 2.4.2020 has prescribed the acceptance of scanned documents for getting the REX number so that the exporter has no physical interface with the agencies. This would ensure that exporters to EU under the EU GSP who have not got the REX number can apply electronically to the agencies (also known as Local Administrators for registration)
