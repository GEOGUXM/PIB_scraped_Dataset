    The implementation of the Action Plan is yielding good results in 23 States/UTs across 47 districts. Kodaggu (Karnataka) is a new district that has been added to this list along with Mahe (Puducherry) that has not reported any fresh cases during the last 28 days. 22 new districts in 12 States have not reported any fresh cases during the last 14 days, which include:

      * Hoshiarpur in Punjab
      * Rohtak & Charkhi Dadri in Haryana
      * Lohit in Arunachal Pradesh
      * Bhardak, Puri in Odisha
      * Karimganj, Golaghta, Kamrup Rural, Nalbari & South Salmara in Assam
      * Jalpaiguri and Kalimpong in West Bengal
      * Vishakapatnam in Andhra Pradesh.

    As of now, the mortality rate for COVID-19 is of 3.3%. Further analysis of the data indicates that out of the deceased:

      * 14.4% of people are 0-45 years age group
      * 10.3% 45 -60 years age group
      * 33.1% 60-75 years age group
      * 42.2% are from 75 years and above age group

    The data shows that 75.3% of the cases belong to above 60 yrs age category. Also it is seen that 83% of cases had co-morbidities. This brings to fore the earlier highlighted facts that elderly people and people with co-morbidities are at higher risk.


    After reviewing the worldwide testing methodology, National Taskforce of ICMR has issued a Guideline to all states. Detailed Guideline can be seen at:
