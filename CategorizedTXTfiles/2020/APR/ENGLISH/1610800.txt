      Posted On: 03 APR 2020 8:20PM by PIB Delhi


    Indian Air Force continues its support to contain the spread of the Novel Coronavirus. The medical supplies are being transported to equip the state governments and supporting agencies to combat the contagion effectively and efficiently.


    During the last two days, IAF airlifted essential medical supplies and commodities from nodal points to Guwahati, Dibrugarh and Mohanbari in North Eastern region; Prayagraj, Gorakhpur, Bareilly and Agra in the Central region; and the Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh.


    In addition, IAF airlifted critical medical supplies to Male, Maldives as 'Operation Sanjeevani' on 02 Apr 20. Maldives has faced shortage of essential medical supplies as its connectivity with Indiaâ€“ its main source of medical supplies, was broken after COVID-19 lockdown. Active support of MEA, HQ IDS, MoH&FW and various other government agencies was invaluable to the success of this mission.


    Quarantine facilities created at IAF bases across the country continue in a state of readiness. IAF is ever ready and geared up to meet all the emerging needs in support of the nation to fight the pandemic.
