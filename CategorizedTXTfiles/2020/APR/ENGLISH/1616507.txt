    Pertinent to mention that on the National Monitoring Dashboard ( https://darpg.gov.in ) in the grievance portal, an exclusive window was introduced for COVID related grievances as a result of which, any grievance related to COVID got directly registered, to be accordingly followed up by the concerned.
