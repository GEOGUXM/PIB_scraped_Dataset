    Even through there is nationwide lockdown Daporijo bridge over Subansiri river has been constructed by Border Roads Organisation (BRO), keeping in mind utmost precautions against COVID-19 so as to connect this strategic Line of Communication in Arunachal Pradesh.


    Bridge on Daporijo River is a strategic link towards the LAC between India and China. All supplies, rations, constructional material and medicines pass over this bridge. Old Bridge developed cracks which could lead to a major catastrophe like on 26 Jul 1992 when a passenger bus fell off the bridge leaving no survivors. With the intervention of DGBR and CE Arunank expeditious sanctions were obtained from the MoD and Arunachal Government. The difficult and dangerous launch was completed in record time adhering to all COVID-19 precautions.


    Work had started for construction of the bridge on March 17, 2020 by 23 BRTF. Finally after 27 days on April 14, 2020 the bridge was jacked down successfully and safely on the supports. It has been successfully upgraded from class 24 tons to class 40 tons thereby allowing heavier vehicles to pass catering for not only Army requirements but the future Infrastructure development requirements of Upper Subansiri district.


    Chief Minister of Arunachal Shri Pema Khandu inaugurated it over video conferencing and open for traffic movement from today.


    Safe and early execution of the bridge represents the seamless coordination and cooperation between the BRO, MoD and Arunachal Government.
