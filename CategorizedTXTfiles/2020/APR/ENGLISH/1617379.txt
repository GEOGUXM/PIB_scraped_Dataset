    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:


         1. Crude oil production by ONGC during March, 2020 was 1778.11 TMT which is marginally higher 0.56%when compared with March,2019 but 14.57% lower than the target for the month. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-March, 2019-20 was 20626.95 TMT which is 6.89%and 1.97% lower than target for the period andproduction during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

      * Non realization of production from WO-16 cluster due to unavailability of MOPU.
      * Less production from B-127 Cluster due to increase in water cut.
      * ESP issues in wells of NBP and Ratna fields.
      * Increase in water cut in certain wells of Mumbai High, Heera, Neelam& B173A fields.
      * Less oil production due to restriction of movements for field operations in onshore fields due to COVID-19 lockdown.

         1. Crude oil production by OIL during March, 2020 was254.07 TMT which is 13.65% lower than the monthly target and 8.64% lower than the March, 2019. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-March, 2019-20 was 3106.61 TMT which is 9.29% and 5.66% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

      * Rise in water cut in wells & decline in total liquid production of wells as a consequential effect of the wells shut-in during bandhs.
      * Impact on progress of Workover and Drilling operations due to COVID-19.
      * Less than planned contribution from workover and drilling wells as well as old well.

         1. Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during March,2020 was 665.25 TMT which islower by 12.45% than the monthly target and 17.67%lowerthanMarch, 2019.Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-March, 2019-20 was 8435.71 TMT which is 10.86% and 14.51% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively.Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

      * RJ-ON-90/1: Less than planned contribution from workover and drilling wells. ESP and Operations issues etc. in the Mangala, Bhagyam Aishwarya, ABH and Satellite fields.
      * CB-OS/2: Production reduced in 5 oil wells due to water loading and sand issue. (CEIL)

    Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production


         1. Natural gas production by ONGC during March, 2020 was 1905.52MMSCM which is 19.23% lower than target and 10.74% lower when compared with March 2019. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC duringApril-March, 2019-20 was 23746.19 MMSCM which is 8.13% and 3.76% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively.Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

      * Closure of gas wells in offshore in March’20 due to less offtake by GAIL and GSPC due to on-going COVID-19 lockdown conditions.
      * Less Gas production from Vasistha/S1 wells in EOA due to sand/increase in water
      * Non-realization of gas production planned from WO16 cluster.
      * Less than planned gas production from Bassein field, Daman Tapti Block and marginal fields.
      * Less production due to less gas off take by OTPC, Tripura.
      * Less production due to less gas off take by gas consumers in Cauvery and Rajahmundry assets and no gas off-take in Jodhpur Asset.

         1. Natural gas production by OIL during March, 2020 was 211.62 MMSCM which is 22.10% lower than monthly target and 10% lower than March, 2019. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-March, 2019-20 was 2668.25 MMSCM which is 19.38% and 1.97% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * Decline in production potential of gas wells consequent shut-in during protest and bandhs.

      * Controlled production because of low market demand (Tea Sector) during lockdown due to COVID19.
      * Brahmaputra Valley Fertilizer Corporation Limited,BVFCL’s Namrup-II plants shutdown due to problem in Synthesis Gas Section and Namrup-III plants shut-down due to Urea reactor tube leakage.
      * Low upliftment by NRL due to malfunction of the Power Generation unit.
      * NTPS – Due to various maintenance issues of their existing gas turbines. Besides these, Namrup Replacement Power project (NRPP) shutdown due to compressor valve problem.

         1. Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during March,2020 was 294.03 MMSCM which is 35.53% lowerthan monthly target and34.07% lower than March, 2019. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-March, 2019 was 4765.51MMSCM which is 11.67% and 12.99% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

      * RJ-ON/6: Less offtake by consumers and few wells under workover. (FEL)
      * Sohagpur West: Gas breakout awaited in dewatering wells.
      * Raniganj East: Less offtake by consumers (ESSAR)
      * AAP-ON-94/1: Less offtake by consumers. (HOEC)

     1. Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)


    Refinery production during March, 2020 was 21203.58TMT which is 8.59% lower than the target for the month and5.74% lowerwhen compared with March, 2019. Cumulative production during April-March, 2019-20 was254385.82 TMT which is0.14% and 1.1% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III . Company-wise production for the month of March, 2020 and cumulatively for the period April-March, 2019-20vis-à-Vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.
