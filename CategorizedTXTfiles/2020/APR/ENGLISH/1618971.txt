      Agartala Smart City uses mobile kiosk for COVID-19 sample collection
      Posted On: 28 APR 2020 5:18PM by PIB Delhi


    Agartala Smart City has designed and handed over a Mobile COVID-19 sample collection kiosk to cityâ€™s Chief Medical Officer (CMO). The kiosk ensures protection to the sample collecting doctor & prevents wastage of personal protection equipment (PPE). This initiative is a major step by Agartala in the fight against Covid-19.


    Mounting of the kiosk on three wheeler vehicle enables it to navigate through narrow lanes & helps collection of samples from community itself. There is no need for patients to come to hospital for giving sample. The kiosk also facilitates mass testing of larger number of people in a shorter timeframe. This initiative was taken by the Municipal Commissioner, Agartala Municipal Corporation, who is also the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Agartala Smart City Limited.
