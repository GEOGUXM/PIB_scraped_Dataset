    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind in his message on the eve of Easter has said:-


    “On the auspicious occasion of Easter, I extend my greetings and best wishes to all the fellow citizens, especially to the members of the Christian community in India and abroad.


    It is believed that Jesus Christ resurrected on this very day which is celebrated as Easter. A very sacred festival for the Christians, Easter inspires people to follow the path of love, sacrifice and forgiveness. Let us learn from the teachings of Jesus Christ and work together to advance the common good of entire humanity.


    May this festival instil in us the sense of unity and reinforce our commitment to the well-being and prosperity of our nation and a shared society. In these testing times, when we are fighting COVID-19, let us all resolve to celebrate this sacred festival with our families while staying at home, following 'Social Distancing' norms and other government instructions”.
