In addition to this, NHM has already sanctioned Rs. 1100 Cr to all the States & Rs. 3000 Cr additional funds were released today. Also, N-95 masks, Ventilators and PPEs are being procured from the central pool and distributed to all the States across the country.


    As of now, 4067 confirmed cases and 109 deaths have been reported. 291 persons have been cured/discharged after recovery.


    As per the presently available data, an analysis of total confirmed cases has presented the following distribution:

      * Gender distribution:
          + 76% are male
          + 24% are female
      * Age distribution:
          + 47% people - below 40 years age group
          + 34% people - between 40 to 60 years age group
          + 19% people - 60 and above age group

    Following observations are made while analysing the reported 109 deaths due to COVID-19:

      * Gender distribution:
          + 73% are male
          + 27% are female
      * Age distribution:
          + 63% deaths reported for elderly people (60 and above)
          + 30% deaths reported for people between 40 to 60 years
          + 7% deaths reported for people below 40 years

    As of now, 86% death cases have exhibited comorbidity related to diabetes, chronic kidney issues, hypertension and heart related problems. Although 19% confirmed cases have been reported among the elderly, since 63% deaths have been observed among them, elderly people form a high risk population. Further, though 37% deaths are reported from people below 60 years, approximately, 86% of deaths amongst people with co-morbidities indicate that young people with co-morbidities are also at high risk of COVID-19.
