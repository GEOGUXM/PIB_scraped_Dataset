    Under Lifeline UDAN cargo flights operated till date, 56 out of the 74 flights, have been operated by the Air India Group. The flights over a six-day period (26-31 March 2020) have been operated by Air India, Alliance Air, IAF, Pawan Hans and private carriers. Aerial distance covered by Lifeline Udan flights till date is over 70,000 km and Cargo transported till date is around 38 tons. The Lifeline Udan flights are being operated despite significant logistical challenges in road transportation of cargo to and from airports; and in the movement of aviation personnel.


    Bulk of the cargo comprises low-weight-high-volume products like masks, gloves and other consumables that require more cargo space per ton of material. Special permission has been granted to store cargo in the passenger seating area, with due care and precautions.


    On the international front, MoCA and Air India are working with Chinese authorities to establish a cargo air-bridge between India and China for critical medical supplies from 3rd April 2020 onwards. The Ministry of Civil Aviation and the aviation industry is determined to support India’s war against COVID-19 by transporting medical air-cargo to India’s remote corners in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.


    The date-wise breakup of the Lifeline Udan flights is as follows:
