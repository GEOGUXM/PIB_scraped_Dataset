      Posted On: 13 APR 2020 5:30PM by PIB Delhi


    The National Statistical Office (NSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation is releasing CPI (Rural, Urban, Combined) on Base 2012=100 for the month of March 2020 (Provisional) and February 2020 (Final) in this press note. In addition to this, corresponding Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) for all India Rural, Urban and Combined are also being released.


    2. Price data are collected from selected 1114 urban markets and selected 1181 villages by the Field Operations Division of NSO, MoSPI in a uniform weekly roster. Keeping in view the preventive measures taken by NSO and announcement of nation-wide lockdown by the Government to check spread of COVID-19 pandemic, the field work for price collection of Consumer Price Index (CPI) was suspended with effect from 19 th March, 2020 and about 66% of price quotations were received. For assessing the price behavior of remaining price quotations, NSO follows well established and internationally accepted methodology and practices. The overall impact of missing price data on estimates of General CPI at national and state level and CPI for Sub-Groups, Groups at All India level are within acceptable limits. Accordingly, the CPIs for Sub-Groups, Groups, General CPI (R, U & C), CFPI (R, U & C) at All India level and State-wise General CPI (R, U & C) are being released.


    3. All India Inflation rates ( on point to point basis i.e. current month over same month of last year, i.e., March 2020 over March 2019) , based on General Indices and CFPIs are given as follows:
