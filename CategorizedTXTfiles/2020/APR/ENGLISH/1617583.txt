Port Health Officers assisted by MbPT doctors & medics formed the first stage. In the Second stage, the crew were checked and stamped by MCGM health authorities for 14-day home quarantine. In the third and most critical stage, the swab of all disembarking crew was collected for testing.


    Thereafter the usual processes of custom, immigration, security and port clearance were completed with all PPE & social-distancing norms. The crew will continue to be in quarantine in Mumbai until their test reports come negative.
