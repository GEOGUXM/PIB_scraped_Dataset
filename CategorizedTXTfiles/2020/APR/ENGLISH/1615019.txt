    To overcome the time delays and swift delivery of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and masks, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has shifted testing facility from Defence Research Development Establishment (DRDE), Gwalior to Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences (INMAS), Delhi. The INMAS is another premier Life Science Laboratory of DRDO. The facility at INMAS is fully operational for testing and evaluation of body suits and masks. More than 50 batches of these items have already been tested at the laboratory.


    The DRDE, Gwalior which has been at the forefront in fighting COVID-19, has now been tasked to do the testing of masks only received by HLL Lifecare Limited from foreign countries before it is distributed to various agencies.
