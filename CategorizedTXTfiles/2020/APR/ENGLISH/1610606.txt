    After 09.04.2020, the beneficiaries may go to the branch or BC on any date as per normal banking hours. Banks may accordingly phase out the credit to beneficiary accounts. Banks have been advised to intimate the above schedule to the beneficiaries through sms intimation as per the following text:


    “We care for you. Under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package, a sum of Rs. 500/- pm has been deposited in the a/c of Women Jan Dhan Yojana Beneficiaries for the month of April 2020. Pl contact your Branch/ Bank Mitra tomorrow/ on …….(date) to avoid inconvenience. Stay safe stay healthy!”


    (Bank may choose the appropriate option from the underlined text)


    In addition to sms messages as per the above text, local publicity (through local channels/ print media/ cable operators/ local radio/ other channels) may also be carried out making clear that the money credited to the accounts is available for withdraw when required and if the beneficiary needs to draw the money immediately, she may approach the bank branch or BC as per the schedule mentioned in para 3 above. It may be emphasised that the schedule has been drawn up in the interest of orderly disbursement while maintaining social distancing.


    In this context, State Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC) convenors have been directed to immediately contact the State Governments, apprise them of the staggering plan and seek their support for suitable security arrangements at branches, BC kiosks and ATMs. The State Government may also be requested to issue suitable instruction to the District administration and police authorities to support the bank in arranging orderly disbursement of money to be beneficiaries and in carrying out local publicity.


    Heads of all Public Sector and Private Sector Banks have been asked to issue suitable instructions in this regard to Branch officials and Business Correspondents.
