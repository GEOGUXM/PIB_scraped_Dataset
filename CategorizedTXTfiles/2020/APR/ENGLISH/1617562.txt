    DoPT (Department of Personnel & Training) online Corona course is receiving huge response and within two weeks of its launching, over 2,90,000 training courses have been initiated and over 1,83,000 users have registered on the platform.


    Disclosing this here today to the media, Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said that in a novel experiment, possibly the first of its kind, DoPT had introduced a module for empowering frontline Corona Warriors through the learning platform https://igot.gov.in . What was envisaged to be an online medium to equip the frontline Corona Warriors with training and updates in coping with the Covid pandemic has in fact proved to be a unique success story which would possibly be emulated in different forms in the times to come, he said.


    It was further informed that the exclusive platform has been providing training modules on flexi - time and on - site basis so that Covid response can be delivered at scale to the smart phones. A dedicated android based app for this purpose has also been launched and can be downloaded using the link https://bit.ly/dikshaigot .


    The Covid learning platform is based on Prime Minister Sh Narendra Modi’s vision to empower the frontline warriors and also to protect them from falling prey to the Covid pandemic by equipping them with the right kind of knowledge. The training contents of the course include Basics of COVID, clinical management, ICU care management, infection prevention and care, usage of PPE, quarantine and isolation, training for NCC cadets, management of COVID 19 cases, laboratory sample collection and testing, psychological care of patients, paediatric care in COVID, pregnancy during COVID, etc.


    The new learning content is being regularly added to the module and the training modules are designed to cater to the training requirements of 18 sets of roles ranging from Doctors, Nurses, Paramedics and Police Organisations to Nehru YuvaKendras, Anganwadi and ASHA workers.
