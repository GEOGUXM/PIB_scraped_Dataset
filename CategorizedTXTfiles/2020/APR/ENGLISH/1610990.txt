    The Ministry of Civil Aviation is undertaking continuous efforts at policy level and ground level to add substantially in the country’s fight against Covid-19. The cargo delivered to various parts of the country includes COVID-19 related reagents, enzymes, medical equipment, testing kits & PPE, masks, gloves & other accessories of HLL & cargo requisitioned by State/UT Governments and also postal packets.


    With the delivery of essential medical supplies to various states and ICMR centres across the country, the following has been achieved:


      * Delivery of reagents/ medical kits enables testing of patients on time and hence further steps are taken accordingly

      * Doctors as well as other people can protect themselves and others with the use of masks and gloves delivered through these flights
      * Medical supplies delivered to NE and remote areas ensures that no region of the country is left behind in this fight against Covid-19

    Hub & spoke lifeline services have been started so that simultaneously, different and far located parts of the country can be catered to and resources are utilised optimally.


    The date wise break up of flights is as below:
