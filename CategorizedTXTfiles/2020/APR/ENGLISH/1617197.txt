    The Administrator HSVP, Faridabad is the Nodal Officer for this action plan and is assisted by Estate officer HSVP and other supporting staff. The SDM Faridabad provides support in the form of issuance of car passes and identity cards etc. Funds and other resources are managed through contributions from civic society, semi-government and non- government organisations, CSR funds, Red Cross, Disaster Management funds, Municipal Corporation funds, food items available in mid-day meal scheme, anganwari ration, PDS and other government schemes.
