    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind in his message on the eve of Mahavir Jayanti has said: -


    “On the auspicious occasion of Mahavir Jayanti, I extend my greetings and best wishes to all fellow citizens, especially to the Jain community.


    Lord Mahavira's Nobel teachings of non-violence, truth and renunciation are relevant in every age and for every person. By following these teachings, an inclusive and egalitarian society can be created where everyone gets equal opportunities by promoting mutual coordination and harmony.


    Let us get inspiration from Lord Mahavira's life and his teachings for spreading peace, love, virtue and harmony in the world. Also, keeping in mind the spread of COVID-19 virus, citizens should follow all government guidelines including social distancing to contain it.”
