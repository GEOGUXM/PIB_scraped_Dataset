      MoHUA Launches Revised Version of Swachhata App to Handle Queries Specific to COVID 19
      Posted On: 09 APR 2020 1:08PM by PIB Delhi


    The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs yesterday announced the launch of a revised version of the existing Swachhata-MoHUA App, at a video conference (VC) held with all States, Union Territories (UTs) and cities, under the Chairmanship of Shri Durga Shanker Mishra, Secretary – MoHUA, on the COVID 19 crisis. The Swachhata-MoHUA App, a highly popular grievance redressal tool for citizens under the ambit of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) already has over 1.7 Crore+ urban users across the country. This app has now been modified and strengthened further in order to enable citizens to get their COVID-related complaints also redressed by their respective ULBs.


    The revised version of the Swachhata App essentially leverages the popularity and huge user base of the app to better support citizens during this COVID pandemic. However, the addition of these new categories has no impact on the existing categories of the App and citizens may continue to post their grievances in either of the categories.


    Speaking at the VC, Shri Mishra said,“ Under Swachh Bharat Mission- Urban (SBM-U), we are collectively working to ensure the safety and well-being of citizens during the COVID-19 crisis. To provide further support to States, UTs and Cities in this respect, MoHUA has introduced nine additional categories of complaints specific to COVID-19 on the Swachhata-MoHUA App to make it more responsive to the needs of the present times ”.


    The additional nine categories include:

      * Request for Fogging/Sanitation during COVID-19
      * Violation of Quarantine during COVID-19
      * Violation of Lockdown during COVID-19
      * Report Suspected case of COVID-19
      * Request Food during COVID-19
      * Request Shelter during COVID-19
      * Request Medicine during COVID-19
      * Request assistance for COVID-19 patient Transport
      * Request Waste Pickup from Quarantine Area

    The pilot version of the revised version of the App had been shared with select States and cities earlier. Basis the feedback, the same is being launched across India. The announcement was met with appreciation by the State Mission Directors and ULB representatives at the VC who looked forward to leveraging the Swachhata-MoHUA App for redressing citizen complaints related to COVID-19. Swachhata App serves as an effective digital tool enabling citizens to play an active role in the Swachhata of their cities and increase accountability on the part of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).

1        Who is responsible for resolving complaints posted under COVID-19 categories in Swachhata-MoHUA App?                            Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) are responsible to resolve all complaints posted on Swachhata-MoHUA App. As the complaints posted under new COVID-19 categories are critical, ULBs need to take immediate action by either directly resolving the complaints or connecting the citizen with concerned departments. ULBs need to monitor the status of complaints and to ensure the resolution of same.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
2        Will the new Covid-19 categories be part of Swachh Survekshan / GFC / ODF score of ULB?                                         No, the complaints and resolutions under new COVID-19 categories would not be evaluated under Swachh Survekshan / GFC / ODF protocols. These categories have been added only to assist citizens during the COVID-19 outbreak, and providing ULBs with another source of information about their citizens.
