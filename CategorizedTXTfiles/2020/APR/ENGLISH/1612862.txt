      Posted On: 10 APR 2020 1:42PM by PIB Delhi


      During the last two days, there have been some reports in media about various protocols etc of prospective travellers by trains. They have also been mentioning about number of trains starting from a given date.


      It may be brought to the notice of media that final decision regarding above matters is yet to be taken and pre mature reporting on such matters is leading to unnecessary and avoidable speculation in the minds of public in such extraordinary times.


      Its humbly requested and advised that media may consider to avoid publishing on the basis of unconfirmed or unverified matters which may lead to such speculation.


      ‪For the post lockdown Rail travel, Railways would take best feasible decisions in the interest of all stake holders including its prospective passengers.


      ‪As and when a decision is taken, all concerned would be intimated about it.
