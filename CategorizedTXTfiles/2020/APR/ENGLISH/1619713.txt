    (b) the subsequent proposed acquisition by BP Global of an aggregate 49% of the fully diluted paid-up equity share capital and voting rights in and of RBPML by way of acquisition of existing equity shares of RBPML from RIL and subscription by BP Global to fresh equity shares of RBPML.


    BP Global is an investment holding company and holds shares in subsidiaries and associated companies. It currently does not conduct any business operations in India.
