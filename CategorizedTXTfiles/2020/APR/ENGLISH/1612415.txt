    Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today said that the India US Partnership is stronger than ever.


    Shri Modi was responding to a tweet from the US President H.E. Donald Trump who expressed his gratitude for India’s decision to supply Hydroxychloroquine, in the USA’s fight against COVID-19.


    Reciprocating to the US President, “Prime Minister said, Times like these bring friends closer. The India-US Partnership is stronger than ever. India shall do everything possible to help humanity”.


    Fully agree with you President @realDonaldTrump. Times like these bring friends closer. The India-US partnership is stronger than ever.
    
    India shall do everything possible to help humanity's fight against COVID-19.
    
    We shall win this together. https://t.co/0U2xsZNexE
