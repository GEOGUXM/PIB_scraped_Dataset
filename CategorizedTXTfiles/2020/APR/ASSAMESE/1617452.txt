      Misleading Social Media post on problem of migrant labourers in Nagaland
      Posted On: 23 APR 2020 3:55PM by PIB Guwahati


    The Morung Express twitter handle (@morungexpress05) today tweeted “#Nagaland Far from home, migrant workers facing daily challenges.” The tweet also gives the link to the story with the same headline.


    In the news story the thrust is on the assistance that the migrant workers in the state are getting from the government. However, the caption of the tweet and the headline of the story suggest the exact opposite.


    All 11 districts of the state have camps for migrant labourers and their needs for food and essential items are being fully taken care of. The story itself suggests that the migrant workers and BPL families are aware of the facilities and are benefiting from it. District wise State Covid help dashboard has updated details of the assistance being provided to each category of beneficiaries. Distribution of rice and other PDS items and essential goods is being done proactively in all the districts and in the remotest regions of the state. This help is being given as a result of the PMGKY package of the Central government.


    In this time of crisis, when each section of the society is playing its part in fighting the Covid19 pandemic, it is requested that such misleading headlines and social media captions are avoided and the focus should be to better inform the public of the various schemes in operation and ways in which they can avail themselves of the benefits.
