    A tweet has been circulating in the Social Media today stating that not a single positive case of COVID-19 has occurred in any indigenous Assamese in entire India. The tweet also states that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) may conduct study on the immunity etc, of indigenous Assamese people.


    In response to this tweet, Prof. Balram Bhargava, DG, ICMR says "There are no such studies on this aspect at this moment by ICMR".


    While urging unity and brotherhood in fight against Covid-19, Honâ€™ble Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi on LinkedIn said that COVID-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or border before striking.


    All concerned are advised to refrain from spreading such false information.
