    Imphal Times carried a report titled “Lack of Infrastructures, Equipment in District Hospital Tamenglong a serious concern for denizen” on 22nd April ( https://www.imphaltimes.com/news/item/17344-lack-of-infrastructures-equipment-in-district-hospital-tamenglong-a-serious-concern-for-denizen ) . The story claims that there is a lack of preparedness as the District Hospital does not have testing kit, ICU bed or ventilator.


    Rebutting the claims made in the story, the State Health Department has stated that the district has been provided with 8 consignments of Covid19 prevention items and has 8 isolation beds. Since at present there is no ICU bed dedicated for Covid patient, no ventilator has been assigned to the hospital. The statement further adds that Manipur has two ICMR approved Covid19 testing at JNIMS and RIMS. The statement lists the number of actions taken by the administration in the district, like establishment of quarantine facilities etc, to ensure proper response to any eventuality.


    Any misleading report on preparedness, due to non verification of facts, leads to panic and confusion in the public and as such harms the common resolve to defeat the pandemic. The State Health Department has also requested the said newspaper to withdraw the news item from its website,
