    The Brand Finance survey of brands is conducted across 29 countries covering 10 key sectors. Brand Strength is measured on the efficacy of a brand’s performance on intangible measures, relative to its competitors. The Brand Strength Index is made up of three factors: Marketing Investment, Stakeholder Equity, and the impact of those on Business Performance. On the basis of these factors, each brand is assigned a Brand Strength Index (BSI) score out of 100, which feeds into the brand value calculation. Based on the score, each brand is assigned a corresponding ranking.
