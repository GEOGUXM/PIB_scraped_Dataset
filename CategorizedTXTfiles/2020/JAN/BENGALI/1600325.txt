    Kolkata, January 23, 2020.


    On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, homage was paid by Deputy Director Prof. S K Bhattacharyya, Registrar Prof. B N Singh, Dean of Student Affairs Prof. Somesh Kumar and Dean International Relations Prof. Baidurya Bhattacharya along with other faculty, students and staff of the Institute.


    Director Prof. Virendra Kumar Tewari who was travelling shared on his social media handle the following message quoting Bose:


    "Life loses half its interest if there is no struggle-if there are no risks to be taken" ~ Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, September 22, 1920


    Challenges are opportunities for new avenues to explore, new methods to experiment, the future to carve. Struggles are as inevitable in life as a crawling caterpillar transforming itself into a butterfly, as a newborn seeing the light of this world and growing up each day. Those are the pathways of nature. In our lives, we have our goals to achieve, our visions to fulfil. Each attempt to such achievement is not without risks and finding our success through them is what brings out the best in career and lives. Every Kgpian aspires such excellence which reflects in their holistic student life. I hope we are able to share the motivation with the youth of India to work towards greater good and well being.


    Certain student groups shall hold deliberations on the thoughts and ideas of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
