    EPFO has launched a very important initiative of empowering such EPF members who have left service but their employers are not updating their date of exit in EPF records. Due to this, the employees often find it difficult to avail EPF services, especially transferring of their PF accounts or withdrawal of PF accumulations.


    The employees can now themselves update their date of exit in EPF records. The employee would need to login to his/her EPF account to update their respective date of exit. It has to be ensured that atleast 2 months have elapsed since the date of leaving service. Further, the employee will be able to only add the date of exit for the last month for which EPF contributions have been received in their respective EPF account.


    We would request you to give wide publicity to this employee-friendly initiative.


    We also request all EPF registered employers and employees to urgently update their KYC details (Aadhar, Bank Account and Mobile Number) with their Universal Account Number (UAN) issued by EPFO.


    This would help all employers and employees to take full advantage of digitally enabled EPF services.
