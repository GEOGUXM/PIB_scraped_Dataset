    The tableau of Shyama Prasad Mookerjee Port Trust (the erstwhile Kolkata Port Trust) under the Union Ministry of Shipping was showcased in the 71st Republic Day Parade at New Delhi.


    The front portion of the tableau represented a heritage replica of an old ship, reminiscing the ships that arrived at the time of the formation of the first docks. It showed the labourers (then called ‘coolies’) loading and unloading goods (the figures are miniature fibreglass-make human figures). The historic light house and clock tower, all prestigious utilitarian possessions of the Port, symbolised the passage of time and the glorious journey of India’s oldest Port in existence.


    The middle portion focused on Howrah Bridge or Rabindra Setu, one of the city’s finest engineering and architectural surprise built and maintained last 76 years with pride by the Port.


    The 200-Ton capacity cantilever Crane went next which is another handling appliance of the Port that played a vital role in handling imports for the heavy engineering industry, and most recently the Delhi Metro Coaches.


    Its movement of these appliances had been shown in animation. The pipelines and tanks in relief form on the sides represented the role played by Haldia in liquid handling whereas the personnel in safety gear highlighted the port’s commitment to safe work.


    At the rear, another engineering marvel, the motorised Bascule Bridge at Kidderpore Docks was featured through animation. The figure of a modern-day Pilot was visible looking out towards the shore.
