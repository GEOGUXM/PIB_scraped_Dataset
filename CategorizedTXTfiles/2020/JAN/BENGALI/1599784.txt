    To create visionary leaders for the national higher education system, the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India has initiated a Leadership for Academicians Program (LEAP) in 2018. After the successful implementation of this program in 15 different institutions across the country in 2018-19, the MHRD has launched the second phase of the program in 2019-20. The pool of attendees typically consists of acclaimed researchers holding positions of responsibility like Dean, HoD, etc. and who are likely to be the next generation of leaders for our institutions of higher education. The Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata successfully executed the LEAP 2018-19, and is currently conducting LEAP 2020. This year IISER Kolkata is partnering with the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore for the foreign component of the program.


    As a part of LEAP 2020, IISER Kolkata, in collaboration with the Science City, Kolkata, organised two public lectures by extremely eminent speakers on Saturday, 18th January 2020. Dr. Shekhar Mande, the Director General of CSIR spoke on “Balancing blue skies and applied research – the role of leadership”, and Dr. Anil Sahasrabudhe, Chairman of AICTE spoke on “Building networks for a vibrant academic environment in India – Policy and the role of institutions”.
