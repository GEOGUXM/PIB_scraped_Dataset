    All-women post office will be inaugurated at 11 AM on 25.01.2020, at the Mahim Bazar Post Office, Mumbai 400016, by Smt. Arundhaty Ghosh, Member (Operations), Department of Posts, New Delhi in the presence of Shri. H. C. Agrawal, Chief Postmaster General, Maharashtra & Goa Circle; Smt. Swati Pandey, Postmaster General, Mumbai Region; and Smt. Kaiya Arora, Director, Postal Service, Mumbai Region.


    The all-women post office is situated in a prominent market place and residential area where all kinds of postal services are conveniently provided. Given the increased comfort level this is expected to provide to female customers, the said post office is being set up at Mahim Bazar Post Office, where more than 70% of the visitors who arrive for service regularly are women.


    In the said womenâ€™s post office, all posts, right from the post of Postmaster to that of Postman have been filled by women, who will manage and supervise all types of work including Savings Bank Counters, Multipurpose registration booking counters, Aadhaar Centre, India Posts Payment Bank and Treasury work, to name a few. All postal business counters are also being made operational, with proper display of services.


    In this era of women empowerment, where India is working towards guaranteeing equal opportunities to women, launching an all-women post office is another step by India Post, Mumbai Region in the realization of this goal.
