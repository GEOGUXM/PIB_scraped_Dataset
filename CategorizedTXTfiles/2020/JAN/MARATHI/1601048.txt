    Eminent film maker Shaji N Karun inaugurated the Satyajit Ray Pavilion at 16th edition of Mumbai International Film Festival, at Films Division, Mumbai today.


    "If you ask abroad what Indian Cinema is, they say Satyajit Ray. That makes any Indian proud. One of the greatest achievements of a filmmaker is bringing us together, irrespective of language barriers - that is Satyajit Ray”, said Shahji N Karun after inaugurating the pavilion.


    

    Sharing his love for the legendary filmmaker, Dutch Animation Film Maker and Academy Award winner, Michael Dudok de Wit said: “I remember watching the film Appu Trilogy; it was so emotional and beautiful. I decided then that one day I will go to India, to feel the ambience of India. And I have been here three times since then”.


    Director General (West Zone), Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Shri Manish Desai and Director General (Films Division) were also present.


    As a tribute to the eminent film maker, MIFF will screen Satyajit Ray’s iconic films such as Sukumar Ray, Rabindranath Tagore and The Inner Eye during the weeklong festival.
