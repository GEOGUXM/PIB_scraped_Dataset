    MIFF 2020 witnessed an iconic moment when an ex-member of the Azad Hind Fauj and the last living member of the Rani Jhansi regiment, Rama Khandwala attended the screening of Elephants Do Remember.


    Elephants Do Remember is a documentary released in 2019 based on the life of 94 year old Rama Khandwala, who joined the Rani Jhansi Regiment of Indian National Army at the age of 17. "I was always inspired by the speeches of Netaji Subash Chandra Bose. I belonged to a rich household and my grandfather was close friends with Mahatma Gandhi", she said.


    She further added, "At first, it was difficult because our training was no different from the sepoys but later every girl grew into it and loved being a part of it. Netaji always asked us to keep moving forward and today, wherever I am is because of him. I have never met a leader as great as Netaji ".


    
    Filmmakers Swati Pandey, Viplove Rai Bhatia and Manohar Singh Bisht were also present and spoke about the making of the film. "Due to her experience at the regiment and working with Netaji, Rama became avid in Japanese which later helped her become a travel guide for Japanese tourists in Mumbai, â€œ said Swati.
