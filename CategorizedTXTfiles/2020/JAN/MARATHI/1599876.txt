    Mumbai Customs is conducting the Customs Cup Regatta on January 26 in commemoration of the International Customs Day which is being celebrated worldwide in the theme “Customs fostering Sustainability for People, Prosperity and the Planet”. The Regatta will be held off Apollo Bandar, Gateway of India between 1400-1700 hours on the above-mentioned date. It will be followed by an award ceremony at the Royal Bombay Yacht Club (RBYC) graced by eminent and distinguished public figures from varied fields.


    India has made a quantum leap to 68 th rank in “Trading Across Borders” component of the World Bank’s Doing Business (DB) ranking 2020—from 146 in 2018, owing mainly to the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) who have spear headed some path breaking trade-facilitation and ‘Ease of Doing Business’ reform initiatives over the past few years like 24x7 Cargo Clearance, Direct Port Delivery (DPD), Direct Port Entry (DPE), Authorised Economic Operator ( AEO ), Risk Management System (RMS) etc. The Regatta would also be an opportunity to showcase these recent reform initiatives like

      * India’s first National Time Release Study
      * ATHITHI (mobile app based Customs declaration for international travel)
      * ICEDASH (real time web-based performance monitoring in imports)
      * Sabka Vishwas (Legacy Dispute Resolution) Scheme

    Notably, Indian Customs, as guardians of economic frontiers, play a crucial role in safeguarding India’s vast coastline. In preparing Customs officers for duty in a gruelling maritime environment and augmenting their overall level of fitness, the sport of competitive wind sailing and adventure sailing have come to the aid of the department like a godsend. Under the patronage of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), its officers have won many laurels in competitive wind sailing such as the Padma Shri and Arjuna Award. They have also undertaken international goodwill expeditions to Muscat, Mauritius, Seychelles and Singapore.


    The Customs Cup Regatta hosted by the Bombay Customs Yacht Club witnesses participation from elite yacht clubs from all over India including Corps of Military Engineers, Army Yachting Node, Indian Naval Watermanship Training Centre, Indian Customs, Royal Bombay Yacht Club, Bombay Sailing Association, Colaba Sailing Club and Goa Yachting Association and other premier yacht clubs. The turn-out includes famed sailors who have circumnavigated the globe and contributed immensely to the sport of sailing.
