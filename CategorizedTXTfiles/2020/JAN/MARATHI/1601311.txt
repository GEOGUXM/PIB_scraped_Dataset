    Employment generation, coupled with improving employability has been the priority of the Government. Significant progress made in this direction forms a major highlight of the Economic Survey 2019-20


    Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), a key initiative under the Government's Skill India Mission, enables youth to take up Short Term Training (STT) and get their skills certified through Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). Under PMKVY (2016-20), 69.03 lakh candidates have been trained throughout the country as on 11th November, 2019, details the Survey.


    Along with efforts for generating additional employment, special focus has been on improving quality of jobs and formalisation of the economy, notes the Economic Survey. The share of regular wage/salaried employees has increased by 5 percentage points from 18 per cent in 2011-12 to 23 per cent in 2017-18. In absolute terms, there was a significant jump of around 2.62 crore new jobs with 1.21 crore in rural areas and 1.39 crore in urban areas in this category.
