    Army Day is celebrated on 15 th January since 1949 to commemorate the day of taking over command of the Indian Army by General (later Field Marshal) K M Carriappa, the first Indian Commander-in-Chief from Gen Sir F.R.R Butcher, the last British Commander-in-Chief. On this day, we also pay homage to our brave martyrs, whose courage and sacrifice in the line of the duty continues to inspire the Nation. A wreath laying ceremony was held at the War Memorial in Colaba Military Station where Lieutenant General SK Prashar, the General Officer Commanding Maharashtra Gujarat and Goa Area laid wreath on behalf of all ranks.


    A cultural programme was also organised for 1700 soldiers and their families at Colaba Military Station on the eve of the Army Day. Speaking on the occasion, the General complimented the hardwork put in by soldiers and exhorted them to remain dedicated towards serving the Nation with same Ã©lan and pride. A Veterans Outreach Programme is also planned to be held on 19 Jan 2020 at Kalina Military Station as part of the Army Day Celebrations.


    In the past seven decades, the Indian Army has served the nation in adverse and diverse situations. It has also undertaken credible actions in Internal Security and Counter Terrorist/ Insurgency Operations besides extending invaluable aid to civil authorities in Disaster Management during natural calamities. The Army remains steadfast in its commitment to serve the nation with vigour and professionalism of the highest order.
