      Posted On: 09 JAN 2020 6:59PM by PIB Chennai


    At present, A&N islands are connected to the mainland through Satellite link with limited bandwidth capacity with high latency. Hence the Government of India decided to install Submarine Optical link from the Mainland (Chennai) to Andaman & Nicobar islands to provide high speed internet connectivity. Shri. Ravi Shankar Prasad, The Hon’ble Minister of Communications. Electronics & IT and Law & Justice inaugurated the Cable laying work on 09.01.2020 in the August presence of Admiral D.K.Joshi, The Hon’ble Lt.

    The project will connect Port Blair along with seven other Islands of Andaman & Nicobar viz. Little Andaman, Car Nicobar, Kamorta, Great Nicobar, Havelock, Long Island and Rangat. Total length of the submarine cable project is 2250 Kms aznd will have four fibre pairs. Each fibre pair has the ultimate capacity of 6.4 Tbps with very low latency. At present, the combined availability for A & N Islands is only 3.2 Gbps. At the initial stage of commissioning itself bandwidth availability will be 400 Gbps which is nearly 100 times of the existing capacity. The commissioning of this project will elad to socio economic development of A & N Islands due to increased economic activities including tourism.


    BSNL has been appointed as the Project Execution Agency (PEA) by DOT/USOF and the work has been awarded to M/s NEC Technlogies India Pvt. Ltd. Through global open tendering process. The link is targeted to commission by June, 2020.
