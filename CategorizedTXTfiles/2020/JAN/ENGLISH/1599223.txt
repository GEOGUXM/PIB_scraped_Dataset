In phase 2, RailTel will register 39000 users over 34 Railway divisions on NIC e office platform by 30 th June 2020. The phase 1 of NIC e-office execution started with a mandate to complete the work by March 2020. But with a lightning speed of execution RailTel completed the work way ahead of time and successfully created 50000+ users in 58 units of Indian Railways and trained the executives to handle the platform in a span of mere 6 monthsâ€™ time.

Chairman, Railway Board, Shri Vinod Kumar Yadav, Member S&T, Railway Board, Shri Pradeep Kumar, CMD, RailTel, Shri Puneet Chawla and other senior officials of Railways and RailTel were present on the occasion.


    NIC e-Office is a cloud enabled software developed by National Informatics centre (NIC) that is being deployed/hosted from RailTel Tier III certified data centres at Secundrabad and Gurgaon. It is based on Central Secretariat Manual of e-Office Procedure (CSMeOP). Currently 4 modules (File Management System (eFile), Knowledge Management System (KMS), Collaboration & Messaging Services (CAMS) & Personnel Information Management System (PIMS) are the part of the e-office system being implemented.


    E-Office fosters paper-less culture which will not only save operational cost but also reduce the carbon foot print which is one of the most urgent needs of the world and directly impacting every citizen of the country.
