    Availability of reliable and affordable energy is key for development of any country. Several steps have been taken to reform and strengthen the power sector as a whole including power generation, transmission & distribution. The details of year-long achievements for Ministry of Power are as below :

     1. Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (SAUBHAGYA):
      * Launched in Sept., 2017 with the objective to achieve universal household electrification by providing last mile connectivity and electricity connections to all remaining un-electrified households in rural and urban areas by 31 st March, 2019
      * Scheme Outlay: Rs. 16320 Crore including GOI Grant of Rs. 12320 Crore
      * GOI Grant released : Rs. 5720 Crore
      * As on 31 st March, 2019, all States reported electrification of all willing households under ‘Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har GharYojana’ (Saubhagya), except few households in LWE affected Bastar region of Chhattisgarh.
      * Electricity connections to 262.84 Lakh households have been released from 11.10.2017 to 31.03.2019.
      * Subsequently, seven States reported 19.09 Lakh un-electrified households which were un-willing earlier but are now willing to get electricity connection. These households are being electrified by the concerned States and as on 20.12.2019, electricity connections to 7.42 Lakh Households have been released.

     1. Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS):

      * Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) was launched in the year 2014 with an Outlay of Rs. 32,612 crore for improving and augmenting the distribution and sub-transmission systems in Urban areas with a view to improve reliability.
      * Under the scheme, till today, system strengthening of sub-transmission and distribution network has been in 371 circles. 560 additional urban Towns have been IT-enabled, and about 30,000 kms of HT/LT lines have been installed across 546 circles in the country. 820 new substations have been constructed, while more than 50,000 Distribution transformers have been installed. For better work flow management in the Utilities, IPDS has also funded Enterprise resource planning (ERP) across several Utilities, out of which implementation has been completed in 6 Utilities.
      * Under the older projects subsumed under IPDS, till now, 1287 towns have been IT enabled, and SCADA systems have been completed in 57 towns. System strengthening works have been completed in 1195 towns.
      * Significant progress has been made under the scheme in the current financial year with the physical progress of IPDS reaching almost 80% in the system strenghening works. The details of the works accomplished under IPDS in new projects in the current financial year are as follows:

     1. Smart Metering:


      * In the current financial year, Ministry of Power has issued guidelines to all States to convert all existing consumer meters into Smart meters in prepaid mode. Operation of Smart meters in prepaid mode would allow consumers to pay as per their own financial convenience and electricity consumption requirements.

      * EESL, a JV between CPSUs in the power sector, has been providing Smart metering services to various Utilities as per MOUs entered into with them. EESL has also established innovative financing arrangements for the Smart metering projects that would enable them to provide smart metering services to the DISCOMs without requiring any outright CAPEX funding from the States/Utilities. The recoveries against the funding towards smart metering installations would be taken as a monthly annuity from the Utilities over a period of seven to eight years.
      * Apart from installations in NDMC for about 50,000 consumers, EESL has also started installation of Smart meters in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan. Out of these States, the maximum installation is in the State of Uttar Pradesh, where more than 7.78 Lakh smart meters have already been deployed across 11 cities.

      * More than 9 lakh smart meters have been installed in the state of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Bihar, NDMC-Delhi and Andhra Pradesh as detailed below:

     1. Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY):

      * Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY), a scheme for financial and operation turn around of Power Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) was launched by the Government for State owned Distribution Utilities on 20-11-2015 at a time when the outstanding debts and losses of the Distribution utilities had increased to levels that were adversely affecting the viability of the Power and Banking Sectors. The purpose of UDAY was to usher reforms across the Power and coal Sectors through competitive and cooperative federalism to pave the way for 24X7 affordable and reliable Power for all.
      * UDAY incorporated a slew of measures, including financial re-engineering measures, as well as operational improvement measures. Exemptions were given to the States to borrow outside the FRBM limits in order to enable them to take over 75% of the outstanding debts of DISCOMs, as existing on 30th November 2015. The scheme had two outcome parameters: (i) AT&C loss reduction to 15%; and (ii) ACS-ARR gap reduction to zero by March 2019. Due to the large scale of problems/ challenges in some States, as well as late joining, some States were given extension to complete the turn around process by one or two years
      * UDAY scheme is now in final stages, with majority of states having completed 3 years at the end of FY19. The performance from FY16 to FY18 (based on the data submitted by states on the UDAY portal) shows a consistent improvement in AT&C losses, and reduction in annual losses by almost 50% of pre-UDAY times.
      * Significant improvements have been observed in terms of reduction in AT&C loss from 20.7% in FY16 to 18.2% in FY19. The lines losses have come down to below the levels of 20%, due to an increase in billing and collection of revenues, reduction in theft, and reduction in technical losses. States like Bihar, Haryana, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir and Manipur have increased the billing efficiency by ~ 8-10%. In many states, like Assam, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, and Meghalaya, collection efficiency has improved by more than 5%.
      * Similarly, the gap between ACS and ARR has reduced from 59 paise per unit in FY16 to 27 paise per unit in FY19 due to cost side optimization measures including control in power purchase costs, and reduction in interest costs, and discipline in revision of tariff filings in most of the states.
      * Half yearly trends of performance of UDAY States in FY20 indicate that the AT&C losses are lesser than those in the same period by 62 basis points, though there is a marginal deterioration in the revenue gaps. Variation in pattern of electricity consumption due to extent of heat and rainfall accounts for these variations.
      * The Government of India is formulating additional reform frameworks to buttress the efforts under UDAY to achieve a complete financial and operational turn around of State owned Utilities.

     1. Ensuring Sustainability of Power Sector- Addressing issue of Payment delays by Discoms:
      * The Central Government has taken a major step to address the problem of mounting outstanding dues towards Generating Companies by the Distribution Companies by issuing an Order on 28 th June, 2019 regarding Opening and maintaining of adequate Letter of Credit (LC) as Payment Security Mechanism under Power Purchase Agreements by Distribution Licensees. This mechanism has been made effective w.e.f 1 st August, 2019.
      * Under this mechanism the Power will be scheduled for dispatch only after Letter of Credit (LC) for the desired quantum of power with respect to the generating stations has been opened. It shall be ensured by the concerned Load Despatch Centre that such entity, during the period of non-scheduling of power on account of Non opening of LC or advance payment, has no access to procure power from the Power Exchange(s) and they shall not be granted Short Term Open Access (STOA).
      * The measure is expected to improve payments to the power generators and improve sustainability in the Power Sector.
     1. Measures towards reduction of cost of power to the consumer :
      * In order to reduce the cost of power procured by the Distribution Licensees, a new system has been put in place where for Inter State Generating Stations (ISGS), the merit order dispatch at national level shall be followed. Hence the cheapest generation will be available at the maximum level. This is a step where for ISGS, the State level merit order has been shifted to National level merit order. This mechanism has resulted in savings of approximately Rs 3 Crores every day and has a potential of saving Rs 1200 Crores in a year towards power procurement cost of Distribution licensees.
      * An Order was issued by Ministry of Power on 15.11.2019 on “Reduction in cost of power due to pre-payment in entire value chain of power sector”. Electricity Regulatory Commissions are requested to take necessary actions in reduction of cost due to pre payment as in such cases the working capital requirements get reduced. This initiative reduces the cost of power to the consumer.
     1. Promotion of Renewable Energy:
      * In Order to promote the capacity addition of Solar and Wind Power Projects, the waiver available for use of Inter State Transmission System (ISTS transmission charges and losses) has been extended for use of Inter State Transmission System (ISTS) for transmission of electricity by Solar or Wind power projects commissioned till December 2022. The waiver shall be applicable for the twenty five years from the commissioning of such projects.
      * Clarification on Orders related to Renewable Purchase Obligation for Captive Power Plants (CPP) has been issued on 1 st February 2019.
     1. Allowing use of linkage coal for short term power procurement and power exchanges:
      * For the first time, linkage coal was allowed to Power Plants for selling power in the Day Ahead Market (DAM) through power exchanges or in short term through a transparent bidding process through Discovery of Efficient Energy Price (DEEP) portal. A methodology in this regard was issued by Ministry of Power on 2 nd December 2019.
      * Till now the Coal Linkage was granted to power generating stations only for selling power through long term and medium term power purchase agreements. This move shall de-stress the Power Generating Stations which have not secured long term or medium term power purchase agreements.
     1. Revival of Stressed Assets : Pilot Scheme II:
      * In our endeavour for revival of the stressed assets, a Pilot Scheme was introduced by MOP in April 2018 to facilitate procurement of aggregated power of 2500 MW for 3 (three) years (covered under medium term) from the generating companies having coal based Power Plants which are already commissioned without having a power purchase agreement for the quantum of power the Bidder is willing to bid. Based on the experience gained in the Pilot Scheme, Pilot Scheme –II for procurement of another 2500 MW for the period of three years under medium term was notified on 01.02.2019.
