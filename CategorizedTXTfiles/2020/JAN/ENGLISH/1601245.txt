    Investment in social infrastructure is a pre-requisite for inclusive growth and employment. The Government's commitment towards social well-being is a major highlight of the Economic Survey 2019-20 which was presented by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, in Parliament today.


    Trends in Expenditure on Social Services


    As per the Economic Survey, the expenditure on social services by the Centre and States increased from 7.68 lakh crore in 2014-15 to 15.79 lakh crore in 2019-20 (Budget Estimate). As a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the expenditure on social services has registered an increase of 1.5 percentage points during the period 2014-15 to 2019-20 from 6.2 to 7.7 per cent. The expenditure on education, as percentage of GDP increased from 2.8 per cent to 3.1 per cent between 2014-15 and 2019-20 (BE). Similarly, expenditure on health increased from 1.2 per cent to 1.6 per cent during the same period as percentage of GDP, the pre-Budget document notes.


    Human Development


    India's rank in the Human Development Index (HDI) improved to 129 in 2018 from 130 in 2017, reaching a value of 0.647. With 1.34 per cent average annual HDI growth, India is among the fastest improving countries. Among its BRICS peers, India is ahead of China (0.95), South Africa (0.78), Russian Federation (0.69) and Brazil (0.59). To sustain this momentum in human development and to further accelerate it, the role of public sector in delivery of social services is critical, observes the Survey.
