    Election Commission of India has considered the response received from the two Bhartiya Janata Party leaders, namely Sh. Anurag Thakur and Sh. Parvesh Sahib Singh in context of the Show Cause Notices issued to both these leaders on 28 th January 2020 and 29 th January 2020 respectively. The Commission is of the considered view that Sh. Anurag Thakur and Sh. Parvesh Sahib Singh have made undesirable and objectionable statements and thus violated the provisions of Model Code of Conduct and Representation of the People Act 1951.


    The Commission under Article 324 of the Constitution of India and all other powers enabling it in this behalf, bars Sh.Anurag Thakur and Sh.Parvesh Sahib Singh from holding any public meetings, public processions, public rallies, road shows and interviews, public utterances in media (electronic, print, social media) etc in connection with ongoing General Elections to the Legislative Assembly of NCT of Delhi, 2020 for a period of 72 hours (for Sh. Anurag Thakur) and 96 hours (for Sh.Parvesh Sahib Singh) from 5 PM on 30 th January, 2020 (Thursday).


    Election Commission of India's orders already passed on 29 th January 2020 to remove Sh.Anurag Thakur and Sh.Parvesh Sahib Singh from the list of ‘Star Campaigners’ for the current General Election to the Legislative Assembly of NCT of Delhi shall continue to be in force.
