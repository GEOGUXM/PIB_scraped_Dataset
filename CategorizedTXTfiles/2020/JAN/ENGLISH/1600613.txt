    He said, “Gaganyaan mission will be a historic achievement in the field of science and technology for India in the 21st century. It will prove to be a milestone for New India.”


    Prime Minister praised the four pilots of the Indian Airforce who have been selected as astronauts for the mission and their forthcoming training in Russia.


    “These promising youngsters symbolise India's skill, talent, ability, courage and dreams. Our four friends are about to go to Russia in a few days for their training. I am confident that this would script another golden chapter in India-Russia friendship and cooperation.”
