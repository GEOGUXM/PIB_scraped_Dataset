    8. The growth in real GVA during 2018-19 has been lower than that in 2017-18 mainly due to relatively lower growth in ‘Agriculture, Forestry & Fishing’, ‘Mining and Quarrying’, ‘Manufacturing’, ‘Electricity, Gas, Water Supply & Other Utility Services’, ‘Financial Services, ‘Public Administration and Defense’ and ‘Other Services’ as may be seen from Statement 4.2. During 2018-19, at constant prices, the growth rates of Primary (comprising Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Mining & Quarrying), Secondary (comprising Manufacturing, Electricity, Gas, Water Supply & Other Utility Services, and Construction) and Tertiary (Services) sectors have been estimated as 1.0 per cent, 6.0 per cent and 7.7 as against a growth of 5.8 per cent, 6.5 per cent and 6.9 per cent, respectively, in the previous year.


    Net National Income


    9. Nominal Net National Income (NNI) at current prices for the year 2018-19 stands at ₹ 167.89 lakh crore as against ₹ 151.50 lakh crore in 2017-18, showing growth of 10.8 per cent during 2018-19 as against 11.2 per cent in the previous year.


    Gross National Disposable Income


    10. Gross National Disposable Income (GNDI) at current prices is estimated as ₹ 192.63 lakh crore for the year 2018-19, while the estimate for the year 2017-18 stands at ₹ 173.19 lakh crore, showing a growth of 11.2 per cent for year 2018-19 as against 11.1 per cent in the year 2017-18.


    Saving


    11. Gross Saving during 2018-19 is estimated at ₹ 57.13 lakh crore against ₹ 55.38 lakh crore during 2017-18. Rate of Gross Saving to GNDI for 2018-19 is estimated at 29.7 per cent against 32.0 per cent for 2017-18.


    12. The highest contributor to Gross Saving has been the household sector, with saving of ₹ 34.47 lakh crore in the year 2018-19. The saving of private financial corporations has increased from ₹ 1.50 lakh crore in 2017-18 to ₹ 1.77 lakh crore in 2018-19 whereas the saving of the non-financial corporations marginally decreased from ₹ 20.69 lakh crore during 2017-18 to ₹ 20.60 lakh crore in 2018-19. The saving of General Government was (-) ₹ 1.96 lakh crore during 2017-18 and (-) ₹ 1.48 lakh crore in 2018-19.


    Capital Formation


    13. Gross Capital Formation (GCF) at the current as well as the constant prices is estimated by two approaches :– (i) through flow of funds, derived as Gross Saving plus net capital flow from Rest of the World (RoW); and (ii) by the commodity flow approach, derived by the type of assets. The estimates of GCF through the flow of funds approach are treated as the firmer estimates. GCF by industry of use and by institutional sectors does not include ‘valuables’ and therefore, these estimates are lower than the estimates available from commodity flow approach.


    14. GCF at current prices is estimated at ₹ 61.09 lakh crore for the year 2018-19 compared to ₹ 58.49 lakh crore during 2017-18. The rate of GCF to GDP is 34.2 per cent during 2017-18 as against 32.2 per cent in the 2018-19. The rate of GCF (excluding valuables) to GDP stands at 32.9 per cent and 31.1 per cent for the years 2017-18 and 2018-19 respectively. The rates of capital formation in the years 2011-12 to 2018-19 have been higher than the rate of saving because of positive net capital flow from RoW.


    15. In terms of the share to the total GCF (at current prices), the highest contributor is Non-Financial Corporations, and the same has increased from 47.7 per cent in 2017-18 to 49.0 per cent in 2018-19. Share of household sector in GCF has declined from 37.9 per cent in 2017-18 to 37.5 per cent in 2018-19 while the share of General Government in GCF has increased from 12.3 per cent in 2017-18 to 12.7 per cent in 2018-19.


    16. Within the GCF at current prices, the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) amounted to ₹ 54.93 lakh crore in 2018-19 against ₹ 47.99 lakh crore in 2017-18. The rate of GFCF to GDP at current prices has increased from 28.1 per cent in 2017-18 to 29.0 per cent in 2018-19. The change in stocks of inventories, at current prices, increased from ₹ 2.51 lakh crore in 2017-18 to ₹ 3.20 lakh crore in 2018-19, while the valuables decreased from ₹ 2.19 lakh crore in 2017-18 to ₹ 2.00 lakh crore in 2018-19.


    17. The rate of GCF to GDP at constant (2011-12) prices was 37.6 per cent in 2017-18 and 35.6 per cent in 2018-19.


    Consumption Expenditure


    18. Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) at current prices is estimated at ₹ 112.54 lakh crore for the year 2018-19 as against ₹ 100.91 lakh crore in 2017-18. In relation to GDP, the rates of PFCE at current prices during 2017-18 and 2018-19 are 59.0 per cent and 59.3 per cent respectively.


    19. At constant (2011-12) prices, the PFCE is estimated as ₹ 73.80 lakh crore and ₹ 79.08 lakh crore, respectively for the years 2017-18 and 2018-19. The corresponding rates of PFCE to GDP for the years 2017-18 and 2018-19 are 56.0 per cent and 56.6 per cent respectively.


    20. Government Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE) at current prices is estimated as ₹ 21.04 lakh crore for the year 2018-19 as against ₹ 18.38 lakh crore during 2017-18. At constant (2011-12) prices the estimates of GFCE for the years 2017-18 and 2018-19 stand at ₹ 13.43 lakh crore and ₹ 14.79 lakh crore respectively.


    Per Capita Estimates


    21. Per Capita Income i.e. Per Capita Net National Income at current prices, is estimated as ₹ 1,15,293 and ₹ 1,26,521 respectively for the years 2017-18 and 2018-19. Per Capita PFCE at current prices, for the years 2017-18 and 2018-19 is estimated at ₹ 76,794 and ₹ 84,808 respectively.


    Summary of Revisions in the GDP Estimates


    23. The use of latest available data from various agencies has resulted in some changes in both the levels of GVA and growth estimates for the years 2016-17 and 2017-18. The reasons for revisions in the estimates of the years 2016-17 and 2017-18, released earlier on 31.05.2019 are mentioned in the Annexure.

Also, for horticulture segment, final estimates have been used instead of 2nd advance estimate used in PE. For Forestry, Fishing and Aquaculture, latest production data have been used.

    NOTES ON THE STATEMENTS


    FORMULAE

     1. GVA at basic prices (Production Approach) = Output at basic price – Intermediate Consumption
     2. GVA at basic prices(Income Approach) = CE + OS/MI + CFC + Production taxes less Production subsidies (i)
     3. GDP = ∑ GVA at basic prices + Product taxes less Product subsidies (ii)
     4. NDP/NNI = GDP/GNI - CFC
     5. GNI = GDP + Net primary income from ROW (Receipts less payments)
     6. Primary Incomes = CE + Property and Entrepreneurial Income
     7. NNDI =NNI + other current transfers from ROW, net (Receipts less payments)
     8. GNDI = NNDI + CFC = GNI + other current transfers (iii) from ROW, net (Receipts less payments)
     9. Gross Capital Formation (iv) = Gross Savings+ Net Capital Inflow from ROW
    10. GCF = GFCF + CIS + Valuables + “Errors and Omissions”
    11. Gross Disposable Income of Govt. = GFCE + Gross Saving of General Government
    12. Gross Disposable Income (GDI) of Households = GNDI – GDI of Govt. – Gross Savings of All Corporations

    REMARKS ON THE FORMULAE

     1. Production taxes or subsidies are paid or received with relation to production and are independent of the volume of actual production. Some examples are:

    Production Taxes - Land Revenues, Stamps & Registration fees and Tax on profession


    Production Subsidies - Subsidies to Railways, Subsidies to village and small industries.

     1. Product taxes or subsidies are paid or received on per unit of product. Some examples are:

    Product Taxes- Excise duties, Sales tax, Service Tax and Import Export duties


    Product Subsidies- Food, Petroleum and fertilizer subsidies.

     1. Other Current Transfers refers to current transfers other than the primary incomes
     2. Estimate of GCF derived from this formula is taken as the “firmer” estimate and the difference between this estimate and the sum of GFCF, CIS and valuables is taken as “errors and omissions”, as referred in 10 above.
