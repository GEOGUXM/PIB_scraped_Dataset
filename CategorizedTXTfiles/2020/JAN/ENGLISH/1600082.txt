      Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


      Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:


      1.1 Crude oil production by ONGC during December, 2019 was 1748.63 TMT which is 11.93% lower than the target and 0.71% lower when compared with December, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-December, 2019 was 15386.96 TMT which is 4.79% and 3.28% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively.


      Ø Non realization of production from WO-16 cluster due to unavailability of MOPU.


      Ø ESP issues in wells of NBP field and Ratna R-series.


      Ø Less production from B-127 Cluster due to increase in water cut.


      Ø Increase in water cut in certain wells of Mumbai High, Heera, Neelam & B173A.


      Ø Disruption in field activities in Assam due to protests.


      1.2 Crude oil production by OIL during December, 2019 was 207.74 TMT which is 29.52% lower than monthly target and 24.44% lower when compared with December, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-December, 2019 was 2354.74 TMT which is 7.99% and 6.43% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Major reasons for Disruption in field activities in Assam due to protests.


      1.3 Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during December, 2019 was 694.44 TMT which is marginally higher by 0.20% than the monthly target and 15.94% lower than December, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-December, 2019 was 6633.87 TMT which is 8.04% and 11.70% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      Ø RJ-ON-90/1-MANGLA (CEIL): Delay in making 45 FM-1/4 infill wells on line. Lag in liquidating the inventory of planned workover and production optimization jobs. ESP failure in FM-3 well M-357, M-359 and M-387.


      Ø Operational issues in Bhagyam, Aishwarya and ABH fields. (CEIL)


      Ø CB-ONN-2005/9 (Mercator): Oil production from Jyoti-1 is stopped. Well closed for long term pressure build up study and could not be put back in production due to non-grant of EC for development campaign.

      Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production


      2.1 Natural gas production by ONGC during December, 2019 was 1998.37 MMSCM which is 11.58% lower than target and 9.04 % lower when compared with December 2018. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC during April-December, 2019 was 17918.28 MMSCM which is 5.75% and 2.70% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively.


      Ø Non-realization of gas production planned from WO16 cluster from Dec’19 in absence of MOPU.


      Ø Less Gas production from Vasistha/S1 wells in EOA due to sand incursion issues.


      Ø Less production due to less gas off take by OTPC, Tripura.


      Ø Disruption in field activities in Assam due to protests.


      Ø Less gas off take by gas consumers.


      2.2 Natural gas production by OIL during December, 2019 was 225.98 MMSCM which is 17.38% lower than monthly target and 2.87% lower than December, 2018. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-December, 2019 was 2077.79 MMSCM which is 0.82% higher than the production during the corresponding period of last year but 18% lower than the cumulative target. Major reason for shortfall in production is less gas withdrawal by major customers owing to shutdown of their plants.


      2.3 Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during December, 2019 was 416.44 MMSCM which is 4.87% lower than monthly target and 4.67% higher than December, 2018. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-December, 2019 was 3854.29 MMSCM which is 5.70% and 7.64% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      Ø RJ-ON/6: Production is lower due to less offtake by consumers. Production also lowers due to zone pressure depletions in some wells, water ingress and tubing damage. (FEL)


      Ø Sohagpur West: Dewatering wells gas breakout awaited, slow gas ramp up in pilot wells and scaling in producing wells. (RIL)

      3. Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)


      Refinery production during December, 2019 was 20829.85 TMT which is 1.00% higher than the target for the month and 0.96% lower when compared with December, 2018. Cumulative production during April-December, 2019 was 190384.89 TMT which is 0.94% higher than the target for the period but 1.19% lower than production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III . Company-wise production for the month of December, 2019 and cumulatively for the period April-December, 2019 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

      3.1 CPSE Refineries’ production during December, 2019 was 11662.07 TMT which is 6.06% lower than the target for the month and 8.55% lower when compared with December, 2018. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-December, 2019 was 107892.32 TMT which is 0.14% and 4.64% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


      Ø IOCL-Guwahati & Digboi: Lower due to Bandh.


      Ø IOCL- Barauni and Panipat: Lower due to high DHDT feed stock.


      Ø IOCL- Gujarat: Lower due to high VR (Vacuum Residue) stock.


      Ø IOCL- Haldia, Bongaigaon & Paradip: Lower due to deferment of shutdown.


      Ø IOCL- Mathura: Lower than due to deferment of BS-VI shutdown.


      Ø BPCL- Kochi: Lower due to operational issues.


      Ø HPCL- Visakh: Lower due to primary unit shutdown.


      Ø NRL- Numaligarh: Lower due to refinery turn around


      Ø MRPL- Mangalore: Lower due to ullage constraint.


      3.2 Production in JV refineries during December, 2019 was 1827.67 TMT which is 15.09% higher when compared with the production of December, 2019 and 10.23% higher than the target for the month. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-December, 2019 was 14969.09 TMT which is 6.22% and 14.54 higher than the target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year.


      3.3 Production in private refineries during December, 2019 was 7340.11 TMT which is 10.85% higher than the target as well as corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-December, 2019 was 67523.48 TMT which is 1.58% higher than the target as well as corresponding period of last year.


      3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of December, 2019 and cumulatively for the period April-December, 2019 vis-à-vis April-December, 2018 are given at Annexures - IV and V respectively.
