    As a part of continuous thrive towards seamless freight operations, Eastern Railway (ER) took an initiative to enhance the provision of illumination at Malda Goods-Shed, to facilitate easy loading and unloading of freight rakes even during the night. This new illumination work will make it more convenient for the customers, staff and other stakeholders to unload and clear the inward rake or loading freight into the outward rake on round the clock basis.


    Presently, at Malda Goods-Shed 25 to 30 freight rakes are unloaded per month on an average. The augmented illumination will facilitate enhanced freight traffic there, which can be availed by both the business community and freight service customers. It will be helpful for labourers and loaders also for round the clock operation at the shed.
