    With a view to prevent growing cases of Covid-19 pandemic and to ensure the safety of employees, South Eastern Railway (SER) has taken all out efforts to produce reusable face masks and hand sanitizer at its four divisions namely, Kharagpur, Adra, Ranchi and Chakradharpur as well as at Kharagpur Workshop. The masks and sanitizer are prepared under the strict supervision and guidance of the Medical Department of SER.


    All the divisional units of SER and Kharagapur Workshop have taken major initiatives to gear up their machineries and have produced 1,48,553 reusable face masks and 12,799 litres of hand sanitizer so far.


    To provide extensive support to its employees, SER has distributed reusable face masks and hand sanitizer amongst the frontline staff like loco pilots, guards and concerned staff engaged in running of freight, parcel and special trains for ensuring their protection from the pandemic.


    Apart from the above, masks and sanitizer are also sent to health units and hospitals over SER. The masks are largely being made using cotton clothes with straps for adjustment and can be reused after proper washing. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Kits are also prepared at the Kharagpur Workshop and Kharagpur Divisional Unit of SER for supporting the doctors, nurses, paramedical staff and health care personnel.


    SERâ€™s in-house production will not only ensure timely supply of the masks, sanitizer and PPEs to the frontline staff and health care personnel but will also result in substantial cost savings.
