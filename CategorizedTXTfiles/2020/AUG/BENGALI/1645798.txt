    As the Government of West Bengal has withdrawn the complete lockdown in the State on August 28, 2020, the Special Train Services regulated by South Eastern Railway (SER) on that day has been withdrawn. SER has hence taken the decision to run these trains on August 28, 2020 as per the existing timings and path.
