    Consequent upon the directives of the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports, Government of India, Eastern Railway (ER) has organized Fit India Freedom Run in all its Divisions & Workshops. The concept of such a run is to spread awareness for maintaining fitness of body & mind so that one can run/walk along the route of his/her choice at a time that suits him/her. One can even take breaks during such runs/walks. Basically, one runs his/her own race and times his/her own pace. The campaign has already started and will end on October 2, 2020.


    Bharat Scouts & Guides, ER, Asansol District started the campaign on August 30, 2020 with a cycle marathon of approximately 2 km from District Scout Den at Railway Traffic Colony to Divisional Football stadium at Railway Domohani Colony. The programme was flagged off by District Chief Commissioner, Bharat Scouts & Guides and ADRM, ER, Asansol Shri M. K. Meena and Vice President of ERWWO, Asansol Smt. Alka Meena. The marathon started at 7.00 am with 40 participants who cycled and reached the destination. Reaching the point, all did some fitness exercise like jogging, stretching etc.


    After warming up, a session of Yoga was done by the participants. On completion of all the activities, all promised to carry on with this regime at home and also creating awareness among the neighbours to do some fitness activity and create a BETTER AND FIT INDIA.


    Fit India Freedom Run is continuing in all the Divisions and Workshops for maintaining fitness of body & mind.
