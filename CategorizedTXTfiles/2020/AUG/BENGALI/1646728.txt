    The Office of the Chief Postmaster General, West Bengal Circle has informed that to facilitate the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) beneficiaries for enjoying smooth credit of the DBT through their Post Office Savings Bank or POSB accounts, such beneficiariesâ€™ accounts are required to be seeded with their AADHAR numbers immediately.


    It has been noticed by the concerned authority that many DBT accounts in POSB are not seeded with the AADHAR of the beneficiaries. At present such POSB account-holders are receiving DBT credits in their accounts through the account route National Automated Clearing House (NACH) of National Payment Corporation of India (NCPI). However, as per the advisory of the Government, many institutions are moving their DBT towards AADHAR Based Payment System or ABPS.


    This made the India Post authority to take the decision of switching over to ABPS from NACH for helping the beneficiaries more.
