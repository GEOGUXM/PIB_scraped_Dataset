    The world today is crippled by the throes of the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic and the nations worldwide are collaborating and innovating to facilitate trans-border movement of goods and international trade for maintaining essential supply chains and for the welfare of humanity. Despite such positive endeavors to deal with this international emergency, some miscreants are using this Pandemic as an opportunity to execute their smuggling pursuits and unlawful operations.


    The ‘COVID Warriors’ of Government of India are relentlessly working not only to facilitate legitimate international trade but also to prevent smuggling activities. The alert and vigilant officers of Commissionerate of Customs (Preventive), West Bengal developed and executed a well-planned operation to prevent smuggling of Indian Cultural Heritage through unauthorized routes and channels.


    On the night of 23 rd August 2020, the Commissionerate of Customs (Preventive), West Bengal, seized 25 Antiques at South Dinajpur District of West Bengal which were being taken to Bangladesh, through Kaliyaganj border concealed in a Truck carrying Paddy. These 25 seized artefacts are a cultural heritage of India and comprise of 7 Stone Idols of Goddess Parvati, Manasha Devi, Lord Vishnu and Lord Surya, 7 Metallic artefacts made of Bronze and Octo Alloy (Ashtadhatu) used for casting metallic idols in Hindu and Jain Temples and 11 Terracotta idols, all Antiques ranging from 9th Century AD to 16th Century AD.


    The experts from Akshaya Kumar Maitreya Heritage Museum under University of North Bengal, Siliguri, have confirmed that the idols are antiques and have collectively valued them at approximately Rs. 35.3 crore. Apparently, it is biggest seizure of Antiques in recent times.


    The officers of the Commissionerate of Customs (Preventive), West Bengal had earlier also seized 7 Antique Idols having antique value of Rs. 11 crore in January 2020. In an effort to prevent smuggling of contrabands, officers of Customs are keeping surveillance on the suspicious activities. Following are the details of the recovered artefacts:

19.                 Image of Hindu Deity Ganesha, measuring length 19.5 inches and breadth 15 Inches. The image has been carved out of a terracotta plate in which the deity is standing in Kamalasana with eight hands filled with weapons. The artefact is rare and unique as the deity is wearing Mukuta and other jewelries and every pattern is explicit.                                     As a unique and rare artifact, the tentative antique value is given Rs. 02 Crores (Two Crores).
