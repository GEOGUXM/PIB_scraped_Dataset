    The selfless toil of farmers even when the whole nation was under complete lockdown helped the country go hunger- free despite other difficulties. No wonder Prime Minister praised the contribution of farmers in ensuring food security of the nation during this trying times. Free ration is being given by the union government to more than 80 crore people because of the bumper harvest as farmers toiled hard defying covid 19. On August 9, Prime Minister announced to transfer Rs 17 thousand crore Rupees under PM KisanSammanNidhi to the accounts of 8.5 crore farmer families. First instalment of Rs 2000 was given to farmers in April itself . Till now in the last one and a half years, Rs 75 thousand crore has been directly deposited in the bank accounts of farmers under PM KisanSammanNidhi scheme. Under this scheme, farmers will get Rs 2000 each in three instalments totalling Rs 6000 per annum in their accounts.This scheme has arrived as a blessing to small and marginal farmers who always suffer to manage their expenses as agriculture is dependent on vagaries of nature. Union and state governments are implanting various schemes to mitigate the sufferings of farmers especially during lockdown too.


    Farmers in TiruchirapalliKarur and Perambalur have welcomed the union government's gesture for implementing PMkisanSammanNidhi scheme. Shri Mani farmer from KarurKulithalaiThaneerpalli while appreciating the governments aid also urged govt to increase the aid as there is no income during lockdown. Shri Chinnasamy, farmer from Pommanapadi, Perambalur , Shri Praveen farmer from KulithalaiKarur and Shri Ramadorai, farmer KulithalaiKarur thanked the government for crediting the aid in advance due to lockdown .


    The clarion call by Prime Minister to be self reliant especially during covid 19 lockdown has been accepted fully by farmers. It is the farmers who have helped the government fight the covid 19 by making us self reliant in food security. India has produced enough food grains for their own citizens and is ready to export for those countries who are in need of it. Union Government is showing the nationâ€™s gratitude to farmers by implementing schemes to help the farmers to sustain their agriculture.
