    Certain groups circulating doctored graphics of Arunachal Pradesh’s COVID-19 update on the Social Media platform (Facebook).


    The Information and Public Relations team of Arunachal Pradesh’s government issued notices condemning the act of these mischief mongers & asked the public to report any such misinformation in the platform if found.


    This act of spreading misinformation among public is highly condemnable. All concerned are advised to refrain from spreading such false information.
