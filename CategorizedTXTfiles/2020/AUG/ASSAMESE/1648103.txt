    Certain groups circulating old social media (Twitter) post of DD News Shillong that Chief Minister of Meghalaya Conrad Sangma has announced a complete lockdown on Monday and Tuesday in Shillong. The update also mentioned that lockdown will be used to trace contacts of the cases reported in Shillong.


    The DD News Shillong clarified that the post is from 11 July. And DD News Shillong have not reported any such announcement from CM of Meghalaya today i.e 23.8.2020.


    This act of spreading misinformation among public is highly condemnable. All concerned are advised to refrain from spreading such false information.
