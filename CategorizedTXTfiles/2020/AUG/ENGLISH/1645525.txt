    The National Statistical Office (NSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation is releasing Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Base 2012=100 for Rural, Urban and Combined for the month of July 2020 (Provisional) in this press note. The corresponding Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) for all India Rural, Urban and Combined are also being released.


    2. The Price data are usually collected from selected 1114 urban markets and selected 1181 villages through personal visits by field staff of Field Operations Division of NSO, MoSPI on a weekly roster. As the various pandemic related restrictions were gradually lifted and non-essential activities started resuming operations, availability of price data has also improved. NSO collected prices from 1054 (95%) urban markets and 1089 (92%) villages during the month of July, 2020. CPIs for Sub-Groups, Groups, General CPI (R, U & C), CFPI (R, U & C) at All India level and State-wise General CPI (R, U & C) are being released for those State/UTs where responses from 70% or more markets have been received from rural and urban sector separately.


    3. In view of above, final indices for the month of June 2020 and provisional indices for the month of July 2020 have been compiled by following the usual practice of bottom-up approach (aggregating from State level indices). All India Inflation rates ( on point to point basis i.e. current month over same month of last year, i.e., July 2020 over July 2019) , based on General Indices and CFPIs are given as follows:
