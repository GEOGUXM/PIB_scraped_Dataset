    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:

         1. Crude oil production by ONGC in nomination block during July, 2020 was 1738.56 TMT which is 3.24%lower than target but 0.42%higher when compared with July 2019. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-July, 2020 was 6806.96 TMT which is 2.42%and 0.89% lower than target for the period andproduction during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

      * Production planned from WO16 cluster from June’20 could not be realized due to delay in MOPU (SagarSamrat) as activities at GPC yard Abu Dhabi got affected due to Covid restrictions/lockdown

      * Production planned from new wells in Ratna field affected due to non- availability of ESPs due to implications of COVID-19.
      * Production planned from new wells from Cluster-8 project has been affected due to toppling of D-30-2 platform jacket during installation and further delay in installation of new platforms due to COVID implications

         1. Crude oil production by OIL in the nomination during July, 2020 was250.61 TMT which is 5.99% lower than the monthly target and 8.48% lower than the July, 2019. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-July, 2020 was 997.0 TMT which is 3.33% and 7.72% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

      * Less than planned contribution from workover and drilling wells.
      * Less than planned contribution from Old well due to rise in water cut in wells & decline in total liquid production of wells.
      * Loss of oil production due to bandh/blockade by local people /union /association after the blow out at BGN#5 and nearby areas.

         1. Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs in the PSC regime during July,2020 was 644.42 TMT which islower by 8.86% than the monthly target and 15.64%lowerthanJuly, 2019.Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-July, 2020 was 2504.81 TMT which is 6.51% and 17.26% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively.Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * RJ-ON-90/1 (Rajasthan Block): (1) Mangala - Near term impact of pre-production and optimization jobs including zone conversions. (2) Bhagyam – Higher PCP & electrical failures, delayed start-up full field polymer injection and additional downtime due to OHL/Grid failure (3) Aishwarya – Delayed startup of polymer injection in full field, lower UF VRR and additional downtime due to ESP failure in 3 producer wells. (4) ABH - Delay in hookup of ABH Stage-2 wells. (5) Saraswati - Sara1 is shut-in (SRP stopped) due to no liquid flow observed. (CEIL)

      * CY-ONN-2002/2: Well MDDD was planned to put on production in June 2020, however, it could not be taken up due to local agitation. (ONGC)
      * CB-ONN-2000/1: (1) Well PK#2 is not producing due to casing collapse and soil breakthrough in the well. (2) Well SE_DEV#1, SE#1A and SE1#A1 is shut-in due to unavailability of effective demulsifier to break tight water and oil emulsion. (3) Minor shortfall in production in SRP operated well (PK2#A1, PK2#A2 & PL#1) due to power failure by UGVCL (power distributer). (GSPC)
      * KG-ONN-2003/1: Delay in completion of new infill wells on account of pending FDP submission and decline in production from 02 wells. (ONGC)

Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-July, 2020 was 1099.76MMSCM which is 13.64% and 34.62% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

      * KG-DWN-98/3: Production not yet commenced from the field. (RIL)
      * RJ-ON/6: Less offtake by buyer. (FEL)
      * RJ-ON-90/1 (Rajasthan Block): RDG - Delay in new RDG plant start up due to Covid-19. (CEIL)
      * Sohagpur West: Dewatering wells gas breakout awaited, scaling in producing wells and impact of COVID-19 lockdown. (RIL)
      * KG-DWN-98/2 (U-3B): Well not producing as per the anticipated profile .(ONGC)

    Figure 3: Crude Oil Processed ( Crude Throughput)


         1. CPSE Refineries’ crude oil processed during July, 2020 was 10374.45TMT which is 14.93% lower than the target for the month and22.72%lowerwhen compared with July, 2019. Cumulative crude throughputby CPSE refineries during April-July, 2020 was 36177.39TMT which is 22.54% and 24.55% lower than target for the period and crude throughputduring corresponding period of last year respectively.Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * IOCL- Barauni, Haldia, Mathura and Panipat: Lower due to COVID-19 Pandemic i.e. low product demand.

      * IOCL- Digboi: Lower due to DCU shutdown.
      * BPCL-Kochi: Actual crude charge was maintained in order to meet the demand for the products.
      * HPCL-Mumbai& Visakh: Lower due to planned shutdown of secondary units.
      * CPCL-Manali: Lower due to lower product demand on account of Covid-19 lockdown.
      * MRPL-Mangalore: Lower due to Lower demand due to impact of Covid-19 lockdown.
      * NRL- Numaligarh: Lower, due to maintained in line with demand of MS/HSD
      * BORL-Bina: Lower due to lower product demand in view of COVID 19 pandemic and ongoing monsoon.
