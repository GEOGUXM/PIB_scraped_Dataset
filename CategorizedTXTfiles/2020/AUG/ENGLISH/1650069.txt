    Election Commission of India deeply mourns the passing away of Former President Sh Pranab Mukherjee.


    Expressing grief, Chief Election Commissioner Sh Sunil Arora said "In his demise, the nation has lost a widely respected savant and a Rajrishi known for his encyclopaedic knowledge of economic, constitutional and historical affairs."


    Recalling Sh Pranab Mukherjee's specific association with Election Commission of India, CEC Sh Arora said despite failing health Shri Pranab Mukherjee had graciously accepted ECI's invitation and delivered the first Sukumar Sen Memorial Lecture, organised by ECI on 23rd January 2020. Shri Mukherjee, as President of the republic, had addressed ECI's National Voters Day event twice in 2016 and 2017.


    "May God give his family the strength to bear this irreparable loss", Sh Arora added.
