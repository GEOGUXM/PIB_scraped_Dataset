    Prime Minister also exhorted the tech entrepreneurs in a LinkediN post asking them to ‘Lets Code for An Aatmanirbhar Bharat’


    The App Challenge was launched on the Innovate platform of MyGov, the citizen engagement platform of Government of India, and received as many as 6,940 entries from tech entrepreneurs and start-ups across the country, by 26th July, the last date for receipt of entries. The first of its kind, App Innovation challenge sought entries for 9 different categories namely Business, eLearning, Entertainment, Games, Health, News, Office and Work from Home, Others and Social. Atal Innovation Mission, Niti Aayog actively collaborated and supported MyGov in conduct of the Challenge along with Meity Startup Hub and National e Governance Division, under Digital India Corporation of Ministry of Electronics and Information technology.


    The entries received were screened by teams and the top entries in each category were shortlisted for evaluation by an eminent Jury comprising of the best of the technical minds and experts from Industry, Startups, Academia and Government.


    Over a period of 5 days from July 31st to August 4th, extensive presentations were made by the Jury members who assessed the Apps on the parameters of robustness, scalability, security and ease of use. Interesting and Innovative Apps were received in all categories and the Jury after the presentations identified 24 Apps to be rewarded with prizes. Another 20 Apps were identified for Special Mention which have a great potential in being Apps for the future. Jury also made a mention that there are many other Apps who are at various stages of development and they will also compete with the award winning Apps in the near future. Accordingly, it was suggested to have a policy to have such challenges on a regular basis to constantly update the Leader boards as also to provide institutional support through mentoring and tying up with Incubation centers of Atal Innovation Mission as also other Government institutions to kick-start the App Building Ecosystem in India. India is one of the largest App publishers in the world and the Developer community in India have the potential of making Apps that can be the best in the World. It was interesting to note that many of the Apps developers were women and represented almost the entire country. This challenge has proved that India has the talent base to build Apps for the future.
