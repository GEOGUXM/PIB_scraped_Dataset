    As a result of ramping up its testing facilities on a sustained basis, with the aim of touching 10 lakh tests/day, India has touched a new high of the highest number of tests in a single day, so far. A record high of 8,48,728 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours. This has taken the cumulative tests to 2,76,94,416.


    WHO in its Guidance Note on “Public Health Criteria to Adjust Public Health and Social Measures in the Context of COVID-19” has advised comprehensive surveillance for suspected cases. WHO has advised that a country needs 140 tests per day per million population.


    While the national average is 603 tests/day/million population, with focussed efforts of the Centre and effective implementation by the States/UTs, 34 of them have exceeded this figure. States/UTs are being advised to scale up the testing on a commensurate level with the prevailing positivity.


    A key component for the successful implementation of the “Test, Track and Treat” strategy has been the continuously expanding network of diagnostic labs across the country. The network as on today consists of1451 labs with 958 in the government sector and 493 private labs.


    The different types of labs include:


    • Real-Time RT PCR based testing labs: 749 (Govt: 447 + Private 302)


    • TrueNat based testing labs: 586 (Govt: 478 + Private: 108)


    • CBNAAT based testing labs: 116 (Govt: 33 + Private: 83)


    Successful implementation of TESTING aggressively, TRACKING comprehensively & TREATING efficiently has ensured a rising Recovery Rate, which stands at 71.17% today. The total recovered COVID-19 patients have increased to more than 17.5 lakh (17,51,555).


    The recoveries exceed the active cases (6,61,595) by nearly 11 lakh (1,089,960).


    Effective clinical management through a Standard of Care treatment protocol has further ensured progressive and sustained decline in the mortality among COVID patients. The Case Fatality Rate is pegged at 1.95% today, maintaining its path of steady decline.
