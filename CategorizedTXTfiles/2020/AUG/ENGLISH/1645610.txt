    Substance abuse is emerging to be a matter of concern in the country having adverse consequences not just for the person using drugs, but on the family and society at large.

To assess the magnitude of the problem of substance use in the country, Ministry has done a comprehensive National Survey on Extant and Pattern of Substance Use to ascertain the proportion of Indian population using various substances and those affected by substance use disorders. The findings of the National Survey were published in the year 2019.

State Governments and the 272 District Collectors are going to launch the NashaMukht Bharat Campaign on 15 th August 2020 which will run for 7 months till 31 st March 2021. District and State level NashaMukt Bharat Committees formed would devise a strategy and Action plan for the campaign. These committees would ensure that campaign activities are effectively implemented, and the objectives of the campaign are met.


    These 272 districts have been identified based on the inputs received from Narcotics Control Bureau and the findings on the comprehensive National survey done by the Ministry. The Campaign focuses on 272 most affected districts by launching a three-pronged attack combining efforts of Narcotics Bureau, Outreach/Awareness by Social Justice and Treatment through the Health Department.
