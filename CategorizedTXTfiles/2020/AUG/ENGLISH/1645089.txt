      Posted On: 11 AUG 2020 5:33PM by PIB Delhi


      The Quick Estimates of Index of Industrial Production (IIP) are released on 12 th of every month (or previous working day if 12 th is a holiday) with a six weeks lag and compiled with data received from source agencies, who in turn receive the data from the producing factories/ establishments.


      2. In view of the preventive measures and announcement of nation-wide lockdown by the Government to contain spread of COVID-19 pandemic, a large number of the industrial sector establishments were not operating from the end of March, 2020 onwards. This has had an impact on the items being produced by the establishments during the period of lockdown. With the lifting of restrictions in the subsequent periods, industrial activity is resuming. The Index for the month of June 2020 stands at 107.8 as compared to 53.6 and 89.5 for April 2020and May 2020.


      3. For the month of June 2020, the Quick Estimates of Index of Industrial Production (IIP)with base 2011-12 stands at 107.8. The Indices of Industrial Production for the Mining, Manufacturing and Electricity sectors for the month of June 2020 stand at 85.4, 106.9 and 156.2 respectively (Statement I).The Quick Estimates will undergo revision in subsequent releases as per the revision policy of IIP.


      5. As per Use-based classification, the indices stand at 109.2 for Primary Goods, 64.3 for Capital Goods, 102.2 for Intermediate Goods and 110.7 for Infrastructure/ Construction Goods (Statement III) for the month of June 2020. Further, the indices for Consumer durables and Consumer non-durables stand at 77.4 and 157.3 respectively for the month of June 2020.


      6. Statements giving Quick Estimates of the Index of Industrial Production for the month of June 2020 at Sectoral, 2-digit level of National Industrial Classification (NIC-2008) and byUse-based classification are given at Statements I, II and III respectively. As mentioned in the earlier Press Releases since April, 2020, itmay not be appropriate to compare the IIP in the post pandemic months with the IIPfor months preceding the COVID 2019 pandemic. An additional Statement IV giving month-wise indices since April 2020 by industry groups (as per 2-digit level of National Industrial Classification-2008)is also given for users to appreciate the changes in the manufacturing sector.


      7. Along with the Quick Estimates of IIP for the month of June 2020, the indices for May 2020 have undergone the first revision and those for March 2020 have undergone the final revision in the light of the updated data received from the source agencies. The Quick Estimates for June 2020 have been compiled at a weighted response rate of 88 percent, the first revision for May 2020 at a weighted response rate of 91 percent and the final revision for March, 2020 at a weighted response rate of 90 percent.


      8. Release of the Index for July 2020 will be on Friday, 11 th September 2020.
