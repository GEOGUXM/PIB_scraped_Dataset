    Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network has ensured essential immunization services during the COVID pandemic


    Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN) is an innovative technological solution, aimed at strengthening immunization supply chain systems across the country. This is being implemented under National Health Mission by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. eVIN aims to provide real-time information on vaccine stocks and flows, and storage temperatures across all cold chain points in the country. This robust system has been used with the requisite customization during the COVID pandemic for ensuring continuation of the essential immunization services and protecting children and pregnant women against vaccine preventable diseases. eVIN combines state-of-the-art technology, a strong IT infrastructure and trained human resource to enable real time monitoring of stock and storage temperature of the vaccines kept in multiple locations across the country. eVIN has reached 32 States and Union Territories (UTs) and will soon be rolled-out in the remaining States and UTs. To support the Government of India’s efforts to combat COVID-19, eVIN India is helping the State/UT governments monitor the supply chain of COVID response material. Since April 2020, eight States (Tripura, Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab and Maharashtra) are using the eVIN application with 100% adherence rate to track State specific COVID-19 material supplies, ensure availability and raise alerts in case of shortage of 81 essential drugs and equipment. This strong platform has the potential to be leveraged for any new vaccine including COVID-19 vaccine, as and when available.
