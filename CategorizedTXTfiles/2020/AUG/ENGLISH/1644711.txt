    Every year, the President of India hosts an ‘At Home’ Reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan on the anniversary of the Quit India Movement - 9th August - to honour freedom fighters. This year ‘At Home’ Reception could not be organised in view of Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, State/UT Governments have been requested to honour and felicitate freedom fighters with a shawl and angavastram by District Magistrate/Addl District Magistrate/Sub Divisional Magistrate at their homes on behalf of the President. Rashtrapati Bhavan provided Angvastram and shawls to the State/UT Governments through their Resident Commissioners.
