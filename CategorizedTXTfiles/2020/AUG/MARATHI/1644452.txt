    As a part of the celebrations for the upcoming 73rd anniversary of the Indian Independence Day, the Western Naval Command organised a live performance of the Naval Central Band on 08 Aug 20, as a tribute to Corona Warriors at the Gateway of India. The Flag Officer Commanding, Maharashtra Naval Area, was the Chief Guest for the event. The enthralling performance was attended by Senior Officers from the State Administration and the Indian Navy at Mumbai as well as intrepid Corona Warriors.


    The hour long performance featured a wide selection of music ranging from martial music to some soul-stirring patriotic songs. The performance commenced with the Naval Song Jai Bharati and included popular martial and patriotic numbers such as Kadam Kadam Badhaye Ja and culminated with the rendition of the Sare Jahan Se Achha, providing a fitting finale to the occasion. The band performance was telecast live by Doordarshan Kendra Mumbai.


    As part of Independence Day celebrations, Military Bands are holding Band Performances across the country from 01 Aug 20 onwards, as a gesture of gratitude and appreciation of the nation towards Corona Warriors, who have been battling to contain the spread of Corona Virus even at the peril of their own health.
