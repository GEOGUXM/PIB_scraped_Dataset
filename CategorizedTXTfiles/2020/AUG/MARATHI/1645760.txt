    On the occasion of 74th Independence Day, Films Division has painstakingly collected the rare footages of India’s glorious Freedom Movement. Two documentary films - ‘India wins Freedom’ (22min/B&W/Eng./1985) and ‘India Independent’ (20 min/B&W/Eng./1949) will be screened on 15th August 2020 to mark the celebration of Independence Day.


    ‘India wins Freedom’ is a part of India’s Struggle for Freedom series, that deals with the arrival of the new Governor General Lord Mountbatten and the several events that took place leading to the transfer of power from the King’s Government to the people of India on August 15.


    The film ‘India Independent’ depicts India's prolonged struggle for freedom. It recreates on screen the history of foreign rule in India for nearly two hundred years. The story of Indian patriots, from the time of the Mutiny of 1857 (the First War of Independence) to the martyrdom of Mahatma Gandhi is pictorially recorded.


    In addition to this, 14 select films of the Films Division, dedicated to Independence Movement and patriotic spirit are being showcased in an initiative of National Film Development Corporation (NFDC) in the ‘Online Patriotic Film Festival’ running from August 7- 21, 2020. This festival, as a part of Independence Day Celebrations 2020 by Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, is streaming at ‘www.cinemasofindia.com’ for free.
