    96112 Railway officials are now enabled to work on digital platform of NIC e-office, replacing the manual files and the use of e-office has also doubled with the number of e-files increasing from 1.30 lakhs to 2.70 lakhs and e-receipts increasing from 4.5 lakhs to 7 lakhs pre lockdown and during lockdown respectively. With usage of digital filing increasing rapidly, Indian Railways is in a fast track of adapting paperless office culture which will not only save operational cost but also reduce the carbon foot print.


    Due to availability of e-office, majority of file work in Railways can continue smoothly without physical presence in offices which is a boon in a time of crisis. RailTel has also provided Virtual Private Network connections to Railway officials for enabling them to process the file works remotely.


    RailTel, a miniratna PSU under Ministry of Railways, has implemented the NIC e-office suite for 96112 Railway officials of 106 establishments of Indian Railways(Zonal HQs, Divisions, CTI, PUs, Workshops etc.) in two phases which has worked as an enabler for work from home culture. Railway officials have also been provided with rigorous training by RailTel team to handle e-office platform efficiently and condition them to give up the habit of using manual file system.


    NIC e-Office is a cloud enabled software developed by National Informatics center (NIC) that is being deployed/hosted from RailTel Tier III UPTIME USA certified data centres at Secunderabad and Gurgaon.Quick disposal of files and systematic, timely monitoring of pending files has been the other immediate advantage of NIC e Office. With above advantages, Indian Railways is making an active effort to change the work culture for providing better services to public.
