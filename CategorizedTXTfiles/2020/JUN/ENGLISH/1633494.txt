      * Restricted/ no gas off take by consumers in onshore due to Covid-19 lockdown.

         1. Natural gas production by OIL in the nomination during May, 2020 was 228.23 MMSCM which is 13.33% lower than monthly target and 1.15% lower than May, 2019. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-May, 2020 was 430.28 MMSCM which is 9.45% and 5.51% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * Loss of potential in Deohal area due to presence of CO 2 in production stream.

      * Low demand of gas by the customer.
      * Consequential loss due to effect of bandh/blockades
      * Loss of production due the blow out incident at BGN#5 on 27 th May, 2020.

         1. Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs in the PSC regime during May, 2020 was 265.83 MMSCM which is 6.45% lower than monthly target and 37.55% lower than May, 2019. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-May, 2020 was 499.42 MMSCM which is 3.99% and 39.05% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. . Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * KG-DWN-98/2: U3-B well was closed due to less consumer demand due to lockdown. (ONGC)

      * RJ-ON/6: Less offtake by buyer. (FEL)
      * RANIGUNJ SOUTH: Due to Covid-19, company has choked the production due to lower offtake of Gas by many of our customers as they have stopped operating their plant which has adversely impacted our CBM gas sales. (GEECL)
      * PY-1 & AAP-ON-94/1: Low consumer demand. (HOEC)

    Figure 3: Crude Oil Processed ( Crude Throughput)

         1. CPSE Refineries’ crude oil processed during May, 2020 was 8380.68 TMT which is 30.55% lower than the target for the month and 29.55% lower when compared with May, 2019. Cumulative crude throughput by CPSE refineries during April-May, 2020 was 15484.44 TMT which is 29.80% and 33.14% lower than target for the period and crude throughput during corresponding period of last year respectively. The major reason for lower crude oil processed is due to lower demand due to impact of COVID-19 lockdown.

    3.2 JV refineries’ crude oil processed during May, 2020 was 1093.21 TMT which is 11.55% lower than the target for the month and 38.84% lower when compared with May, 2019. Cumulative crude throughput during April-May, 2020 was 2018.35 TMT which is 17.04% and 42.48% lower than target for the period and crude throughput during corresponding period of last year respectively.


    3.3 P rivate refineries’ crude oil processed during May, 2020 was 6873.24 TMT which is 12.93% lower than the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative crude throughput during April-May, 2020 was 13589.52 TMT which is 12.96% lower than the corresponding period of last year.


     1. Production of Petroleum Products


    Refinery production of Petroleum Products during May, 2020 was 17281.78 TMT which is 20.15% lower than the target for the month and 21.26% lower when compared with May, 2019. Cumulative production during April-May, 2020 was 33241.59 TMT which is 18.98% and 22.68% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Unit-wise production of petroleum products is given at Annexure-V . Company-wise production for the month of May, 2020 and cumulatively for the period April-May, 2020 vis-à-Vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-4 and month-wise in Figure-4.

    Figure 4: Monthly Refinery Production of Petorleum Products


         1. Production of petroleum Products by CPSE Refineries during May, 2020 was 7916.33 TMT which is 30.37% lower than the target for the month and 28.64% lower when compared with May, 2019. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-May, 2020 was 14537.39 TMT which is 30.28% and 32.90% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. The major reason for lower production of petroleum products is lower due to lower demand due to impact of COVID-19 lockdown.


    4.2 Production of petroleum Products by JV refineries during May, 2020 was 1018.94 TMT which is 10.34% lower than the target for the month and 38.31% lower when compared with May, 2019. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-May, 2020 was 1845.09 TMT which is 17.53% and 43.46% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively.


    4.3 Production of petroleum Products by private refineries during May, 2020 was 8028.62 TMT which is 8.71% lower than the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-May, 2020 was 16245.14 TMT which is 5.77% lower than the target as well as corresponding period of last year.
