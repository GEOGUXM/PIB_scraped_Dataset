      INDIA-CHINA BORDER SITUATION
      Posted On: 06 JUN 2020 12:25PM by PIB Delhi


    Indian and Chinese officials continue to remain engaged through the established military and diplomatic channels to address the current situation in the India-China border areas. At this stage, therefore, any speculative and unsubstantiated reporting about these engagements would not be helpful and the media is advised to refrain from such reporting.
