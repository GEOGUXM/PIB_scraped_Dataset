    According to the National Weather Forecasting Centre/Regional Specialised Meteorology Centre/Cyclone Warning Divisionof the India Meteorological Department:


    The DeepDepression over Eastcentral Arabian Sea moved northwards with a speed of 11 kmph during past 06 hours and lay centred at 0830 hours IST of today, the 02 nd June, 2020 over Eastcentral Arabian Sea near latitude 15.3°N and longitude 71.2°E, about 280 km west of Panjim (Goa), 450 km south-southwest of Mumbai (Maharashtra) and 670 km south-southwest of Surat (Gujarat).
