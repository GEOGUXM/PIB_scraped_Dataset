    The well marked low pressure area over Southeast and adjoining Eastcentral Arabian Sea & Lakshadweep area concentrated into a Depression over Eastcentral and adjoining Southeast Arabian Sea and lay centred at 0530 hours IST of today the 1 st June, 2020 near latitude 13.0°N and longitude 71.4°E about 370 km southwest of Panjim (Goa), 690km south-southwest of Mumbai (Maharashtra) and 920 km south-southwest of Surat (Gujarat). It is very likely to intensify into a Deep Depression over Eastcentral and adjoining Southeast Arabian Sea during next 12 hours and intensify further into a Cyclonic Storm over Eastcentral Arabian Sea during the subsequent 24 hours . It is very likely to move nearly northwards initially till 02 nd June Morning and then recurve north-northeastwards and cross north Maharashtra and south Gujarat coasts between Harihareshwar (Raigad, Maharashtra) and Daman during evening/ night of 3 rd June .


    Forecast track and intensity are given in the following table:
