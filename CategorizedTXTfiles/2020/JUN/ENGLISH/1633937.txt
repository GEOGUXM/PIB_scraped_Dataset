    In view of the decision of setting up of Foundational Literacy and Numeracy Mission under AtmaNirbhar Bharat, and in view of the focus of Samagra Shiksha towards a Learning Outcome centric approach, it is necessary that NCERT develops the required resources for implementing these in an effective and timely manner, leading to all around improvement in learning outcomes and learning levels of students. On this basis NCERT has been directed by the DoSEL, MHRD to take up the following tasks on priority in 2020-21:


    The Learning Outcomes (LOs)

    New National Curriculum Framework (NCF)


    The new National Curriculum Framework (NCF) for School Education has also been initiated. NCERT will be expected to make changes in the textbooks in accordance with the new NCF. Subject expertswill initiate this process for school education, and give interim report by December 2020.


    While redesigning textbooks, it is to be ensured that nothing but the core content is placed in textbooks. Also, the cognitive load of the textbooks is too high. Additional areas, such as creative thinking, life skills, Indian ethos, art, and integration, etc. need to be integrated. NCERT will also start working on the layout and design of the new textbooks well in advance, however, the new textbooks shall be written based on the new NCF. The new NCF is expected to be ready by March 2021.


    Under AtmaNirbhar Bharat, for PM E-Vidya,NCERT is also expected to prepare content for Class 1 â€“ 12 for SWAYAM PRABHA channels (1 class 1 channel) and start the channels by August this year.
