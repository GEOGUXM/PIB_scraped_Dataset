      Posted On: 12 JUN 2020 5:30PM by PIB Delhi


      The Quick Estimates of Index of Industrial Production (IIP) are released on 12 th of every month (or previous working day) with a six weeks lag and compiled with data received from source agencies, who in turn receive the data from the producing factories/ establishments.


      2. In view of the preventive measures and announcement of nation-wide lockdown by the Government to contain spread of COVID-19 pandemic, majority of the industrial sector establishments were not operating from the end of March, 2020 onwards. This has had an impact on the items being produced by the establishments during the month of April, 2020, where a number of responding units have reported NIL production. Consequently, it is not appropriate to compare the IIP of April, 2020 with earlier months and users may like to observe the changes in IIP in the following months . These Quick Estimates will undergo revision in subsequent releases as per the revision policy of IIP.


      3. For the month of April 2020, the Quick Estimates of Index of Industrial Production (IIP)with base 2011-12 stand at 56.3. The Indices of Industrial Production for the Mining, Manufacturing and Electricity sectors for the month of April 2020 stand at 78.3, 45.1 and 126.1 respectively (Statement I).


      4. As per Use-based classification, the indices stand at 92.3 for Primary Goods, 7.7 for Capital Goods, 42.0 for Intermediate Goods and 21.7 for Infrastructure/ Construction Goods (Statement III) for the month of April 2020. Further, the indices for Consumer durables and Consumer non-durables stand at 5.5 and 89.4 respectively for the month of April 2020.


      5. Statements giving Quick Estimates of the Index of Industrial Production at Sectoral, 2-digit level of National Industrial Classification (NIC-2008) and by Use-based classification are given at Statements I, II and III respectively, for the month of April 2020. It is reiterated that, in the circumstances, the IIP for April, 2020 ought not to be compared with that of earlier months.


      6. Along with the Quick Estimates of IIP for the month of April 2020, the indices for March 2020 have undergone the first revision and those for January 2020 have undergone the final revision in the light of the updated data received from the source agencies. The Quick Estimates for April, 2020 have been compiled at a weighted response rate of 87 percent, the first revision for March, 2020 at a weighted response rate of 85 percent and the final revision for January, 2020 at a weighted response rate of 93 percent.


      7. Release of the Index for May 2020 will be on Friday, 10 th July 2020.
