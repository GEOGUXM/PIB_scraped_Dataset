    Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban (PMAY-U)


    Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban (PMAY-U) completed five years on 25 June 2020. The scheme was launched in 2015 with the objective of providing pucca house to all eligible beneficiaries of Urban India by 2022 with the vision of ‘ Housing for All’. The Mission’s journey of five years has seen several milestones. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has received a validated demand of about 1.12 Cr houses under PMAY (U). Approvals for 1.05 Cr houses have already been sanctioned, of which 65 lakhs are grounded and 35 lakh s have been built and delivered to beneficiaries across the country.


      * The number of houses sanctioned in last five years under the Mission is almost eight times more than those sanctioned under earlier urban housing schemes during the span of 10 years.


      * To ensure regular flow of funds for implementation of PMAY(U), National Urban Housing Fund has been created to mobilize ₹ 60,000 Cr through Extra Budgetary Resources over and above the budgetary allocation for the Mission.


      * Through the Credit Link Subsidy Scheme (CLSS), for the first time, the Middle Income Group (MIG) is being provided benefits for their housing needs. More than 10 lakh beneficiaries belonging to Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), Lower Income Group (LIG) and MIG have so far been brought under the fold of CLSS.


      * Government has identified many alternative and innovative technologies through a Global Housing Technology Challenge- India . 6 Light House Projects are being implemented in six states across the country which will act as live laboratories demonstrating innovative, proven construction technologies for speedier and cost-effective construction of houses which are sustainable green, eco-friendly and disaster resilient.


      * In 2019 only, MoHUA launched Angikaar - a campaign for change management in more than 4000 cities. The campaign addressed and enabled beneficiaries to adapt to life transformation that comes with shifting to a newly constructed house. The campaign also converged with other government schemes like Ayushman Bharat and Ujjawala so that beneficiaries could avail the benefits of these schemes. Around 20 lakh households were covered in the campaign.


      * In line with ‘ AtmaNirbhar Bharat’ , an Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHCs) scheme for providing ease of living to Urban Migrants/ Poor has been announced by the Hon’ble Finance Minister on 14 May, 2020.

Employment for approximately 1.65 Cr citizens has been generated through forward and backward linkages. Around 370 lakh metric tonne cement and 84 Lakh metric tonne steel has been consumed due to investment being made in the houses grounded.
