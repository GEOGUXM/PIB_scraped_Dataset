      Posted On: 02 JUN 2020 3:03PM by PIB Delhi

    According to the National Weather Forecasting Centre/Regional Specialised Meteorology Centre/Cyclone Warning Division of the India Meteorological Department:


    The Deep Depression over Eastcentral Arabian Sea moved northwards with a speed of 11 kmph during past 06 hours, intensified into Cyclonic Storm ‘NISARGA’ and lay centred at 1130 hours IST of today, the 02 nd June, 2020 over Eastcentral Arabian Sea near latitude 15.6°N and longitude 71.2°E, about 280 km west-northwest of Panjim (Goa), 430 km south-southwest of Mumbai (Maharashtra) and 640 km south-southwest of Surat (Gujarat).


    It is very likely to intensify into a Severe Cyclonic Storm during next 12 hours. It is very likely to move nearly northwards during next few hours, recurve north-northeastwards thereafter and cross north Maharashtra and adjoining south Gujarat coast between Harihareshwar and Daman, close to Alibag (Raigad District, Maharashtra) during the afternoon of 03rd June as a Severe Cyclonic Storm with a maximum sustained wind speed of 100-110 kmph gusting to 120 kmph.
