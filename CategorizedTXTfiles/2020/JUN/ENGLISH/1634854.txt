    The National Weather Forecasting Centre/Regional Meteorological Centre, New Delhi of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said:


    ♦ An east-west shear zone runs roughly along 11°N Lat. between 3.1 km & 5.8 km above mean sea level and an off shore trough at mean sea level runs from Karnataka coast to Lakshadweep-Maldives area. Under the influence of these systems, fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall likely over parts of south peninsular India during next 4-5 days.


    ♦ Due to shift of trough northwards and convergence of strong southerly/south-westerly winds from Bay of Bengal over northeast & adjoining east India, widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall very likely to continue over northeast & adjoining east


    India during next 2-3 days. Isolated extremely heavy rainfall is also likely over Sub-Himalayan West Bengal & Sikkim and Assam & Meghalaya during next 24 hours.


    ♦ Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall activity with isolated heavy falls also very likely over East Uttar Pradesh during next 3-4 days and over West Uttar Pradesh during 28-29th June.
