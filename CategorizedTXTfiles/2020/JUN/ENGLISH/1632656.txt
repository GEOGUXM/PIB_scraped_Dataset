    The Finance Minister acknowledged that the Prime Minister has always facilitated a helping hand and recognised MSMEs.We are closely monitoring the situation in consultation with banks so that relief measures announced by the Government are effectively percolated at ground levels especially the transmission of repo rate cuts to consumers in terms of reduced interest rates, said SmtSitharaman.

    While appreciating the significant reforms announced by the Government, Dr D K Aggarwal, President, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry said in his welcome remarks that Rs 20.97 lakh crore stimulus package is a very comprehensive, substantial and one of the largest among the packages provided by other countries in the world.


    Dr D K Aggarwal said that the package is not only the monetary and financial stimulus, but also contains the game changing reforms to take India to the next high.


    He suggested that one-time restructuring of the loans without affecting the classification for the severely impacted sectors such as tourism, aviation, entertainment, real estate, automobile, among others is the need of the hour.


    Dr Aggarwal suggested that there may be a formal communication from the Government to the banking sector to remove the fears from the minds of bankers so that the bank officials are able to sanction and disburse loans to the trade and industry without any fear.


    He suggested that there may not be any criminal proceedings if some business entity turns into NPA because of some genuine reason, said Dr Aggarwal.
