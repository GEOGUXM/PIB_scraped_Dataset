    A video clip is in circulation in social media wherein it has been claimed that lot of oil is flowing into nearby water bodies/river from Baghjan blowout well. But the Oil India Limited has clarified it through a tweet that this is totally false since all hydrocarbon coming out of the well is completely burnt at the well head. As the well head area is dry so no question of any oil flowing into river.


    Before the fire occurred condensate was falling in nearby area as it was coming out along with gas. But once the well caught fire on 9th June, all condensate and gas is getting burnt. So clearly there is no chance for condensate to flow into nearby water bodies.
