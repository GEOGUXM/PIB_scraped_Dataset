International day of Yoga is celebrated every year on June 21 from 2015 onwards under the auspices of the United Nations. Prime Minister Shri NarendraModi had urged the UN to celebrate International Yoga Day as the age old Indian therapy belongs to the world for its wonderful healing effect. Yoga has become part of our life and unknowingly we are performing yoga every day as it is part of our heritage. Thoppukaranams and Suryanamaskarams are simple form of yoga which most of us do regularly.
