    With a view to clear the huge rush of migrants at different places across the country due to nationwide lockdowns in the wake of Covid-19, Indian Railways has started transporting back the millions of migrant labourers and others to their home towns with effect from May 1, 2020 by running of Shramik Special Trains between different States. South Eastern Railway (SER) has also taken major role to provide relief to the distressed migrant workers and other stranded passengers. The passengers of Shramik Special Trains are provided with food and drinking water in various strategic points by Indian Railways Catering & Tourism Corporation (IRCTC).


    Eighteen Shramik Special Trains were received by SER on May 31, 2020 for various destinations of West Bengal, out of which, five trains terminated in SER jurisdiction which were for West Bengal.


    Today, four Shramik Special Trains have terminated at Howrah and one Shramik Special Train has proceeded to Malda Town via Howrah. Two more trains are expected to arrive Howrah today.


    The passengers are received by the civil authorities with necessary arrangements as per protocols.
