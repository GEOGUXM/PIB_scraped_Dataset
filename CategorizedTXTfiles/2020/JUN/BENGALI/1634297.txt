    Railway Electrification is an important activity carried out by railways to provide the most energy efficient, pollution free and speedy mode of transport to the nation. In South Eastern Railway (SER), the total 88% of the entire route kilometre has already been electrified including the main and trunk route. For the rest portion, SER has taken major initiatives to complete the electrification works in the branch line sections.


    The ongoing electrification works of SER are in rapid progress. The Bankura-Sonamukhi (41 KM), the part of Bankura-Masagram electrification project (118 KM) having a total estimated cost of 106.45 crores is in completion stage.


    Electrification of Tatanagar-Badampahar section (89 KM) having an estimated cost of Rs. 105.42 crore is in rapid progress and is expected to be completed within the schedule time.


    The electrification work of Rupsa-Bangriposi (89 KM) is going on full swing with an estimated cost of Rs.94.89 crore and is expected to be completed within stipulated period up to Baripada in the first phase.


    Completion of the above projects will help SER to operate seamless movement of the trains without any change of traction and will lead to the reduction of journey time of the passenger trains.
