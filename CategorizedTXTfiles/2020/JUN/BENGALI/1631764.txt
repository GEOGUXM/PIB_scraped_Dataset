    Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM) will webcast the partial solar eclipse on June 21, 2020 from 10.46 am to 2.17 pm for helping interested students, teachers as well as general people residing in the city. This initiative has been taken in view of the rapid spread of Corona pandemic which is putting a bar to the innumerable science-lovers to be present at this prestigious science institute in physique to witness the various wonders of science.


    The museum, in addition, has also arranged for an online quiz competition on the eclipse from 10 am to 10.45 am on June 21, morning. This apart, there will be an online painting competition on the subject- ‘Eclipses and Superstition’, for the students. The museum authority has informed that scanned entries may be submitted at bitmeducationsection@gmail.com between 10 am and 4.30 pm.


    The museum authority has also invited all science enthusiasts to visit www.bitm.gov.in for participation.
