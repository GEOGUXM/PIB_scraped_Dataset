    In order to clear the huge rush of migrants stranded at different places across the country due to the ongoing lockdown in the wake of rapid spread of Covid-19, Indian Railways is transporting back millions of such people and other stranded ones to their home towns from May 1, 2020 by running Shramik Special Trains. South Eastern Railway (SER) has also taken major role to provide relief to the distressed migrant workers as well as other stranded passengers. The passengers of Shramik Special Trains are provided with food and drinking water in various strategic points by Indian Railways Catering & Tourism Corporation (IRCTC).


    Eleven Shramik Special Trains were received by SER on Wednesday (May 3, 2020) for various destinations of West Bengal, out of which, one train terminated in SER jurisdiction itself which was for the State too.


    Today, one Shramik Special Train from Mumbai arrived at Howrah. The passengers were received by the civil authorities with necessary arrangements as per protocols.
