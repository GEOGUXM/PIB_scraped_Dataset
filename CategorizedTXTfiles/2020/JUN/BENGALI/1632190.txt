    As a part of ER’s endeavour to resist spread of COVID-19, an Automatic Bag Sanitiser Machine has been developed in ER’s Asansol Division.


    The automatic bag sanitizer machine developed in ER has a air blower pump with spray container and nozzle for fog type sanitizing.


    Whenever bag or other luggage is kept at lower base part, automatically it switch on the blower motor and start sanitizing the bag or other type of luggage in the form of sanitiser fog. Again as soon as the bag or luggage is removed from machine, it automatically switch off the motor, resulting in valuable energy saving also.
