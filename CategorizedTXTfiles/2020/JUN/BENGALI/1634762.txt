    South Eastern Railway (SER) has taken major steps for safety related Asset Maintenance Works during the suspension of passenger train services in the wake of outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. The maintenance works included overhauling of rail tracks, major and minor railway bridges, level crossing overhauling, renewal of sleepers, painting of rails in corrosion areas, greasing of joints, raising of lines, renewal of crossings, road safety works etc. considering the railwayâ€™s infrastructure for smooth and seamless passenger and freight train services. The rail routes of SER always have high density of freight and passenger trains which require constant monitoring and hence, maintenance of the infrastructural assets is of utmost necessity.


    SER takes all possible steps in the asset maintenance works in every area under its jurisdiction. The maintenance work of as many as 58 major bridges has been completed by now. As many as 1578 points and crossings and 767 curves have been thoroughly inspected by the railway engineers. Considering the on-going monsoon season, monitoring and maintenance of Railway Bridges has been taken special care of.


    The other works viz. level crossing gates overhauling, renewal of the rails, raising of the platforms, road safety works, guarding foot over bridges, renovations of station toilets etc. were also done during the lockdown. The Engineers, Section Engineers and Trackmen of the Railway were thoroughly engaged in monitoring and maintenance works wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing for smooth running of its Parcel Express Trains, Special Trains and for readiness to run more trains in the coming days.
