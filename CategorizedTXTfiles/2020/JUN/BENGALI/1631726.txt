    The Technology Club of Memari Crystal Model School, Bardhaman has made an Ayurvedic Disinfectant Tunnel in their workshop being the first school in West Bengal to build such tunnel using exclusively own technology.


    The concentrated sanitization mixture used as disinfectant in the tunnel contains camphor oil, menthol and thyme oil in 2:1:1 ratio (10ml/100 litre water). The tunnel can disinfect 12 people in 1 minute. Though Birla Industrial & Technological Museum (BITM), Kolkata has already installed such tunnel in their premises but this is the first initiative undertaken by any school of the state.


    While entering through the tunnel a high pressured air compressor would automatically spray Ayurvedic Disinfectant on the person. This Ayurvedic Disinfectant Tunnel can also be used to sanitize clothes, shoes, school bags along with the upper part of the body of the person. It may be mentioned that normally Sodium Hypochlorite is used as an ingredient for making disinfectant across the country but it has some adverse effect on human beings. This ayurvedic spray is human friendly and has no adverse effect.


    Keeping in mind the situation arising out of present and post COVID-19 pandemic, Birla Industrial & Technological Museum has already installed an Ayurvedic Disinfectant Tunnel for the use of the staff members and visitors coming to BITM.
