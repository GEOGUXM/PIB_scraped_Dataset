    The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has been quoted in several news outlets as saying that the number of Covid-19 cases in India could reach a peak in mid-November and that there could be a shortage of ICU beds and ventilators at that time. The news is completely wrong and baseless. PIB Fact Check has verified this news and said that it is misleading. ICMR has also said that the report is absolutely baseless.
