    The Department of Posts, WB Circle has appealed to its valued customers to take window delivery of the mails and parcels from the delivery office, wherever possible, as there is shortage of delivery staff. The Chief Postmaster General Shri Mervin Alexander has stated that while the post offices in West Bengal Circle are functional in the current pandemic situation, in the city, due to the shortage of delivery staff, the department is facing the constraint of delivering articles in proper time. Sri Mervin also hoped to resume the normal delivery at the earliest and regretted such inconvenience.


    It is a fact that despite all the odds, India Post as an essential service has risen to the occasion to deliver more than 80 lakh Aadhar enabled payments, over 100 lakh DBTs worth Rs 1000 crore, more than 5.31 crore POSB transactions worth over Rs 89,000 crore and critical goods like medicines and PPEs.
