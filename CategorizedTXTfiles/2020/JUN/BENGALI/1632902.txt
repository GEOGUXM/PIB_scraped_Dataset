    With the rapid growth of passenger and freight traffic, it has become necessary on the part of South Eastern Railway (SER) to modernise and maintain the signalling and interlocking equipment at stations on the important trunk lines in order to carry and ease the traffic movement.


    During the nationwide lockdown in the wake of outbreak and rapid spread of COVID-19 pandemic, SER has taken major initiatives in the works of Signal & Telecom asset maintenance all over its network. The maintenance of the assets was done in the area of Multiple-Aspect Signalling, Automatic Signalling, Route Relay and Panel Interlocking, Automatic Train Control, Signalling of Level Crossing, Public Address System, CCTVs at Stations etc.


    The major asset maintenance works in the field of Signal & Telecommunications include Commissioning of five Sliding Booms in level crossings for safety of the road users & two Dual LVCD in the stations for smooth train operations, Power Cable Meggering at 38 stations for uninterrupted power supply, maintenance of 990 Point Machines, replacement of 399 numbers of Cells attached with integrated power supply system, replacement of 351 all type of Relays essential for signalling system, replacement of Signalling/Power Cable for 9.407 kms. stretch to arrest any failure in future, 188 Block Instrument Maintenance related to train operations, Points and Crossing maintenance at 251 stations connected with safe train operations, 217 Level Crossing Gate maintenance, IPS battery Maintenance at 264 stations along with a number of maintenance works in SER jurisdiction during prolonged lockdowns.


    These Signalling and Interlocking works have significantly ensured the safe and expeditious running of trains throughout the system. This maintenance of Signal & Telecom equipment provided with railways is a never-ending process and SER has been doing this during the lockdown in the form of old assets replacement, modernisation and their execution.
