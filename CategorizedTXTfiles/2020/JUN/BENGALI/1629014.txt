    Indian Railways is running Shramik Special Trains since May 1, 2020 in co-ordination with State Governments to bring back the stranded migrant workers, pilgrims, tourists, students, patients etc. from different places of the country to their respective home states. South Eastern Railway (SER) is also playing a big role to provide relief to the stressed migrant workers and other stranded passengers. The passengers of Shramik Special Trains are provided with food and drinking water in various strategic points over SER jurisdiction. On arrival, the passengers are received by the civil authorities with necessary arrangements as per hygiene protocols.


    As a result of the initiative taken by the Ministry of Railways in co-ordination with respective State Governments, so far, more than 150 Shramik Special Trains have terminated at different stations of SER, like Kharagpur, Adra, Ranchi and Chakradharpur Divisions with stranded migrant workers and other passengers. These trains have arrived at Howrah, Hatia, Ranchi, Bokaro Steel City, Tatanagar, Kharagpur, Bankura, Purulia, Balasore, Hijli and Lohardaga stations in SER’s jurisdiction from different parts of the country viz. Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Kerala and the like. In addition, three Shramik Special Trains with stranded migrant workers and others have originated from SER’s jurisdiction so far. One Shramik Special left Hatia Station for Jaipur and another two Shramik Specials left Shalimar for Bikaner and Udhampur.
