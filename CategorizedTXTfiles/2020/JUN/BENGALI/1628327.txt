    South Eastern Railway (SER) has taken major initiative on an urgent basis for restoration of trees and re-greening its Headquarters Campus after the Cyclone Amphan.


    The entire campus of SER Headquarters at Garden Reach was badly damaged due to Cyclone Amphan which swept over Kolkata and suburbs on May 20, 2020. The Headquarters of SER has many century old trees and is renowned for its greenery all around. SER officials say, 237 trees were uprooted/tilted during the Cyclone Amphan.


    Sri Sanjay Kumar Mohanty, General Manager, SER along with other Senior Officers visited the ravaged SER campus on May 21, 2020 morning after the Cyclone Amphan. It was decided to replant as many trees as possible. A team of experts consisting of horticulturists were deployed for re-plantation and restoration of trees.


    Till now 102 trees are restored, out of which, 82 trees mechanically and 20 trees manually. Another 80 trees are supported by rope or wooden poles. The drive is continuing to restore as many trees as possible to bring back the greenery.
