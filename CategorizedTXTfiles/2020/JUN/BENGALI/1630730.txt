    On last Sunday (June 7, 2020), with the help of 140 tonne rail crane, two old dilapidated protection bridges of Eastern Coalfield Ltd., (viz. J K Ropeway) used for carrying sand at Baktar Nagar was dismantled in between Andal & Raniganj block section of Eastern Railway (ER). A mega block was taken to dismantle the structures with 52 mtr. Length, 3 mtr width having an approx. weight of 35 MT. Major Engineering and Signal Telecom works were carried out throughout the Khana–Sitarampur route in the shadow of afore-mentioned mega block on the same day, informed CPRO’s office of ER.


    Changing of worn out post and unit of home signals, testing of points, change of point machine and ground connection, change of battery charger transformer, telecom equipments cleaning, shifting of power pack, cable insulation, synchronization etc. included massive signal & telecom drive initiated in the shadow of mega block. So far as the Engineering Department is concerned, long pending maintenance works viz. oiling of joints, greasing of fishplates, stacking of release materials by crossing single & multiple lines, change of rail, renewal of greasing & glued

    joints, rail piling, installation of web switch, conversion of full set switch were accomplished during the mega block taken that day.
    
    The splendid use of mega block for carrying out bulk Engineering and Signal Telecom maintenance works resulted in huge saving of time, manpower and money. Had these massive maintenance works been undertaken separately, more blocks were required to be taken causing major inconvenience for passengers and freight movement throughout the route.
