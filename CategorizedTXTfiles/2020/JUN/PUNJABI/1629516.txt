    Farmers in the states of Haryana and Punjab have welcomed cabinet decisions regarding agriculture sector. To give a boost to rural India and transform the agriculture sector, the union cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on Wednesday, approved certain amendments and ordinances in relation to the agriculture sector. These decisions will liberalize regulatory environment for farmers, promote barrier-free inter-state & intra-state trade and empower them to engage with companies.


    Talking about these decisions, Jagmohan Singh Grewal, a farmer from Mohali, Punjab said that it would enable farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country ensuring them better remuneration. Another Sangrur-based farmer said it would provide more choices to them to sell their produce releasing better returns. The Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020' , approved on Wednesday, will create an ecosystem where the farmers and traders will enjoy freedom of choice of sale and purchase of agri-produce. It will also promote barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade and commerce outside the physical premises of markets notified under State Agricultural Produce Marketing legislations.

    A Farmer from Haryana said that directing selling of agricultural produce from farmers is a good step by Government and this will assure farmers that every grain of their produce is sold. Sanjeev Kumar from Haryana also said direct selling will help better price realization for farmers and will ensure prosperity for them. Subhash Chahal, another farmer from Kaithal district while expressing the same view on direct engagement, said it will increase their income as there will be no intermediaries. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020’ will empower farmers for engaging with processors, wholesalers, aggregators, wholesalers, large retailers, exporters etc. without any fear of exploitation.

    The amendment to Essential Commodities Act will remove fears of private investors of excessive regulatory interference in their business operations. The freedom to produce, hold, move, distribute and supply will lead to harnessing of economies of scale and attract private sector/foreign direct investment into agriculture sector. It will help drive up investment in cold storages and modernization of food supply chain.


    These decisions to give boost to the rural economy and agriculture sector come in light of series of announcements made last month by Finance Minister, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman under “Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan”.
