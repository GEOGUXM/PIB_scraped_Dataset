    The farmers in the region appreciated recent Union Cabinet decisions vis-à-vis reforms in agricultural marketing. The decisions will be beneficial for them as these would give them more freedom of choice to sell their agri produce, say farmers in the states of Punjab and Haryana. To facilitate ‘One India, One Agriculture market’ and direct engagement of farmers with processors, wholesalers, aggregators, large retailers, exporters on a level playing field without any fear of exploitation, the Government of India has already promulgated two ordinances.


    Veteran Farmer Mahinder Singh from Hoshiarpur district of Punjab appreciated the reforms in the agriculture sector ushered in by the Central Government which he said would enable the farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country at best prices. Rajinder Singh, a farmer from Ludhiana in Punjab said that the decision of the government to lift curbs on sale of crop produce is a welcome step and it would lead to an increase in the income of the farmers. A farmer from Haryana said he welcomes Union Cabinet decisions and such decisions are required to make farmers successful and self-reliant. He also said that he will keeping supporting such decisions in future.

    ‘The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020’ will help farmers engage in direct marketing thereby eliminating intermediaries resulting in full realization of price. Whereas 'The Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020' will create an ecosystem where the farmers and traders will enjoy freedom of choice of sale and purchase of agri-produce. While decision to amend Essential Commodities Act (ECA) remove fears of private investors of excessive regulatory interference in their business operations driving up investment in cold storages and modernization of food supply chain.
