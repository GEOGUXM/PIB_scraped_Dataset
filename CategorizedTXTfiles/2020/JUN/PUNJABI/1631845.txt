    Industrialists in the region agree with the recent projections on Indian economy by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings. They have said that it is feasible in the light of the recent reforms announced. Ajay Budhiraja founder of a MSME Education Consulting business said that growth rate predictions for India's economy by S&P Global Ratings are achievable in view of the recent reforms introduced by government & the political will to implement them. S&P Global Rating has projected that India's economy is likely to achieve a strong recovery following a contraction in this fiscal year, with real GDP growth at 8.5% in fiscal 2022. Anurag Agarwal, an industrialist from Mohali said that it is heartening to see Fitch Ratings predictions of India's GDP growth rate to be 9.5% for next year. He appreciated Government’s initiatives for supply side stimulus, but said there is a need for demand side stimulus too. The Government of India has made a series of announcements last month under “Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan” to provide stimulus to the economy.

    While the optimistic projection on India’s Economy maintains, phased operationalization of Ministry of Home affairs guidelines is leading to resumption of more activities in the region. Issued on 30th May, 2020, these guidelines allow re-opening of religious places & places of worship for public, hotels, restaurants and other hospitality services and shopping malls from 8th June. A street vendor in Malerkotla in Punjab is happy as the lifting of the lockdown restrictions enable him to sell his fruits and earn a living for himself. As precaution is the new normal, observing complete precautions for the safety of his customers, a hairdresser in Longwood in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh gets on with his work wearing a proper PPE kit.

    The current phase of re-opening, Unlock 1, has an economic focus. A strict lockdown was imposed throughout the country since March 24, 2020. All activities were prohibited except essential activities. Subsequently, in a graded manner and keeping the overarching objective of containing the spread of COVID-19 in view, the lockdown measures have been relaxed. The current guidelines, issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) came to effect from June1, 2020.
