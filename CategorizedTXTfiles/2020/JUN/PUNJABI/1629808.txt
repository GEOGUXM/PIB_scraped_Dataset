    The Union Cabinet decisions in the agriculture sector generate optimism among farmers in the agrarian states of Punjab and Haryana. The Union cabinet on Wednesday approved amendment to Essential Commodities Act (ECA) and issued two ordinances paving the way for reforms in agricultural marketing.


    Coming in the light of a series of announcements made last month by Finance Minister, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman under “Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan”, these steps bode well for farmers especially in the states of Haryana and Punjab. Surinder Singh, a farmer from Punjab said that the decision of the central government to deregulate the sale process of crops would prove to be economically beneficial for the farmers as they would be able to get better returns. Inter-state trade will help farmers to sell their crops to other states where there is demand ensuring better rates, says Sadhu Singh, another farmer from the same state.

    A similar feeling can be seen among the farmers in Haryana as Om Prakash from the state says that the move to amend the ECA and lift restrictions on sale of crop produce is a very good step and it fulfills a long pending demand of the farmers. Ram Kumar from Haryana said that all the farmers are happy with the decision of removal of restriction and selling their produce anywhere in the country.

    As farmers show optimism towards these steps, trade associations have also expressed their support. Mr. Bhavdeep Sardana, Vice Chairman, CII Punjab state appreciated the government’s initiative in ushering in major reforms in the agriculture sector which he says would go a long way in improving the economic well-being of the farmers. These steps would help the marginalized farmers to aggregate their produce and market them effectively which would lead to better realization. He further added that removal of certain commodities under essential commodities act is a bold step which will ensure bigger trade in those commodities.

    These decisions follow approval for the increase in the Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for all mandated Kharif crops for marketing season 2020-21 by Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on 1st June 2020.
