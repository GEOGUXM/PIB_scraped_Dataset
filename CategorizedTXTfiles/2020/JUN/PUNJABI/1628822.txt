    Under the new guidelines, states are also advised to encourage “Aarogya Setu” mobile app. The app informs the people of their potential risk of COVID-19 infection and the best practices to be followed to stay healthy, as well as providing them relevant and curated medical advisories. A doctor in Civil Hospital in Karnal, Haryana said it is more important for vulnerable like senior citizens, children etc. and should be downloaded by everyone.
