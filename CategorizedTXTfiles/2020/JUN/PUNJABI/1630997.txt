    Chandigarh, June 11, 2020


    Region, comprising states of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh & Chandigarh UT, is returning to normalcy with phased reopening of areas outside the containment zones under the new guidelines issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). Issued on 30th May, 2020, these guidelines allow re-opening of religious places and places of worship for public, hotels, restaurants and other hospitality services and shopping malls from 8th June. Following this, the state governments in the region have resumed these activities. The Union Ministry of Health and Family welfare has already issued Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on preventive measures to contain COVID-19 to be followed at these places. This current phase of re-opening, Unlock 1, has an economic focus.


    Happy to be back at work and assuring that he would take all the mandatory precautions, Khan Tailor in Chandigarh is grateful to the government for lifting most of the lockdown restrictions. A vegetable vendor in Malerkotla in Sangrur district said that he is happy that the lockdown has been lifted enabling him to earn his bread. Full precautions are being taken at the Bestech Square mall in SAS Nagar, Punjab as the place is completely sanitized before being thrown open to the public. The sanitation workers are disinfecting areas in the mall and cleaning the floor. As the markets have been thrown open to the public, the people are seen taking all the necessary precautions. The main market in Hamirpur in Himachal Pradesh is full of activity though people are acutely aware of the need for using face masks to keep themselves protected.
