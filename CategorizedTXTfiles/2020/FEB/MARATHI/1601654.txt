    “Unlike everyone I never used to like rain as a child, because they created a sense of fear in me; through this film I wanted to express the inner emotion I had for rain, " Director Nagaraj Manjule spoke to the press about his short film An Essay on Rain which was screened, under International Category at MIFF2020 ,with a packed audience.


    

    This is his second short film after Pistulya which was also in Marathi. "Sometimes you don't hunt for subjects; instead the subject will find you. When you see a beautiful sunset you show it to your friend nearby. Making films is also similar. I wanted to show what impressed me", he said about how he chooses a subject for his film.


    

    The film was shot in a village near Pune. “I wanted to shoot when it rains in real. Hence our crew ventured into remote areas to capture rain shots which was hectic and tough. Infact this film is the toughest one I have ever shot so far,” he added.
