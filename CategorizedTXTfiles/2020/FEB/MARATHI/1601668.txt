    The Jury Members of MIFF2020 - National & International Competition category addressed a press conference today. “There were many good films but for an International Film Festival like MIFF, many more entries are expected in both categories, “ said Shaji N. Karun, Chairperson, Jury Committee for International selection.


    Canadian film director and Chairperson of National Jury Committee, Thomas Waugh elaborated the point saying that selection of films should be done more independently and many more international entries should be included. He also said that there should be independent curator for such selection and the process should be done over a period of one year. “There are many good documentaries made in different countries but the shortage of time has curtailed the number of entries which would have reached the festival otherwise,” he added.


    Kireet Khuranna added to it saying even though the task to organize such a huge festival and also selection of movies in two months was challenging, Films Division handled it very well.
    
    Amrit Ganger said, MIFF should be seen as a workshop for young film makers and that their participation should be encouraged.


    Noted director,cinematographer and jury member mentioned that the films should have originality.


    A total of 729 National and 144 International entries were there.
