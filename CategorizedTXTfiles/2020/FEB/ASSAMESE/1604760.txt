    An exhibition on Intensified Mission Indradhanush 2.0 organised by the Regional Outreach Bureau, Guwahati under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting held at Nehrubali, Nagaon today.


    The Director General of North East Zone, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Shri L.R Vishwanath in his speech said that this ambitious scheme was launched by the Central Government to immunise children under 2 years of age and pregnant women against eight vaccine-preventable diseases.


    He said that this flagship scheme was launched to focus on full immunisation coverage of 272 districts spread over 27 states.


    The Director General thanked the District Health officials of Nagaon for their cooperation in the programme.


    A free Health check-up camp including an immunization desk was also arranged on the occasion.


    Central Government launched the Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI) 2.0 across the country on 2nd December, 2019.


    In October 2017, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the IMI. The IMI was built on Mission Indradhanush, using additional strategies to reach populations at high risk, by involving sectors other than health. It was an effort to shift routine immunization into a peopleâ€™s movement.
