      * Shri Rajesh Ranjan, Director General CISF, Shri T. Vikram, IG/South Sector, Senior Officers Of CISF, Officers Of Tamil Nadu Police, Navy, CRPF, NDRF, Officers of The State Administration, Distinguished Guests, Representatives Of Media, Staff And Faculty Of Regional Training Centre Arakkonam, Trainees present on the Parade Ground, their family members, Ladies and Gentlemen
      * A good morning to you all !

    My warm wishes to you on the occasion of Mahasivaratri!

      * It gives me immense pleasure to be here today/ amongst the CISF personnel /who have been serving the nation with dedication, devotion, determination and discipline.
      * You have been guarding, not merely airports and critical and very sensitive establishments of the country/ but the very key-nerves of the nation.
      * At the outset, I salute to your sense of devotion/ and place on record/ my deep appreciation for your commitment and dedication.
      * I congratulate all the trainee officers/ who have completed their training today successfully /and are ready to plunge into action / to serve the Mother Land our Bharath Mata
      * The precision and the passion with which you have carried out your parade today/ is ample evidence of your calibre and potential. Being the Minister of State for Home Affairs in Sri Narendra Modi Government, / I feel now doubly assured of the safety and security of our key infra-establishments .
      * I am sure/ you will sustain this enthusiasm, willpower and disciple throughout your career/ for that is what will give you/ the ultimate satisfaction and invaluable sense of gratification.
      * I also congratulate the proud parents and happy family members/ who have stood by you /in building your career for the service of this great nation.
      * Friends, you all have an opportunity to serve the nation. This is indeed a blessing /and you are all the blessed souls.
      * You all have completed your training on the auspicious Sivaratri day and I pray to Lord Rudra/Siva to bless you and your proud families. Lord Siva symbolises ferocity and may you all be blessed with that ferocity to decimate the enemy.
      * Today is the beginning of a new chapter in your life. After passing out from here/ you will be assigned with the duties of safeguarding Airports/ and other critical scientific and industrial infrastructure of the nation. Your job is so critical/ that it warrants 24/7 alertness and agility.

    I have great respect for soldiers who guard the nation staking their lives/ and your job, I consider/ is more difficult and extremely sensitive.


    A soldier has to face occasional battles/ but /for CISF personnel / every minute is a battle. A soldier very often knows his enemy/ but CISF personnel would not know from where the enemy comes.


    Therefore, you need to be on guard every minute. The nation bestows its hope on you /and I am sure, as always, you will live upto its expectations.


    I have been a witness to how the CISF personnel conduct their duties in the Airports. I often observe that they maintain their cool/ even on occasions of rude behaviour by some passengers in their eagerness not to miss a flight.

      * Friends, please remember that CISF has been entrusted with great responsibilities on its shoulders are executing them relentlessly/ would enable you to be the pride pillars of the Indian economy. The lives of the people /and key-assets of the nation are in your hands
      * The vow taken by you today is your pledge to the constitution of India /and all the values and ideals enshrined in it/ and therefore/ your primary responsibility is towards your constitution and thereby towards the people of the nation.
      * Over the years, CISF has diversified its role and has successfully met new challenges displaying high professional competence; a disciplined and highly skilled work culture and exemplary devotion to duty.
      * It has been possible only because of the hard work and dedication of its men and women. Let me congratulate you all for making CISF what it is today.

    Friends, you are all aware, security dynamics of the nation are constantly changing.Ever since Narendra Modi government has taken over in 2014, we have adopted zero tolerance towards terrorism, Naxalism and any form of violence.


    You may all have noticed / there has been significant and perceptible reduction in naxal or terror induced violence. Reduction in number of incidents does not mean/ that there are no internal or external enemies.


    They may be lying low now/ for the atmosphere is unfavourable with a tough system at the helm of affairs.


    But they may strike anytime. Enemies of the nation may come with new ways to disrupt the progress. They are clever and crafty. They may even use modern technology, as we have seen in some of the instances in the past.


    You can undo them only when you combine your alertness with acumen. So don't think after stepping out of the academy/ your study part will come to an end. In fact/ it begins now. Learn about new technologies, the clever and crafty ways with which the enemy may surprise us.

      * You are expected to make best use of modern weapons, technology and gadgets to ensure country’s “safety and security”.
      * Uniformed personnel are held in great respect and regard in our society. I call upon all of you to extend services in social sector by contributing to the spread of some flagship programmes of the union government such as Swatch Bharat, Yoga, health to every home.
      * Uniformed personnel have always been the flag bearers of social change and in this direction, I am aware, CISF has always lead from the front for which all of you are worthy of my appreciation.
      * It is said that a person can take on any adversity and emerge as a winner, if he is ever ready for a challenge. As such the guiding force that enables you to achieve these heights is rightly held high on the fort wall “sadaiv tattler”.
      * You will face many challenges in line of your duty but remember that these are the challenges that will give you strength to move forward.
      * I once again congratulate you all and wish that in the line of duty, God always be with you and shower his blessings to make you successful so that you keep the flag of this great country and CISF flying high.
      * Personally, I am very happy today to celebrate Sivaratri with you all. I will not forget your love and warmth. I thank you all and thank the Director CISF for giving me this opportunity
      * I wish you all the best both at your professional and personal fronts .
      * Thank you once again!

    Jai Hind!
