      Keeping in view the acute shortage of Anganwadi Centre (AWC) buildings, Joint Guidelines by Ministry of Rural Development, Panchayati Raj and Women & Child Development were issued for construction of 4 lakh Anganwadi buildings across the country in convergence with Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). Under convergence with MNREGS, funds for construction of 29941 AWC buildings in 2015-16 and 81447 AWC buildings in 2016-17 were released to States/UTs. State-wise details of funds released and units approved for construction of AWC buildings in convergence with MNREGS is at Annexure-I.


      However, subsequently under the revised scope of Anganwadi Services implemented from 01.12.2017, the central assistance for construction of new Anganwadi Centre building is available in rural areas in convergence with MGNREGS on reimbursable basis after completion of construction. Details of units approved, funds allocated during 2018-19 and 2019-20 to all States/UTs under the scheme including Andhra Pradesh is at Annexure-II . State Government of Andhra Pradesh have constructed 3960 AWCs during 2018-19.


      To monitor the efficient functioning ofAnganwadi Centres and the status of implementation of the scheme, Government has introduced 5-tier monitoring and review mechanism at different levels (National/State/District/Block and Anganwadi). Government has issued guidelines on 31.03.2011 for constitution of Monitoring and Review Committees at different levels to review progress in implementation of the Scheme.
