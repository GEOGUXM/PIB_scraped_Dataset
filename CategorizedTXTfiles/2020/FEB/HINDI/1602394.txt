      Posted On: 07 FEB 2020 4:40PM by PIB Delhi


    The Central Government is providing honorarium of Rs 4,500/- per month toAnganwadi Workers (AWWs), Rs 3,500/- per month toAWWs at mini-AWCs andRs 2,250/- per monthto AnganwadiHelpers (AWHs). The Government is also providing performance linked incentive of Rs 250/- per month to AWHs effective from 1 st October, 2018. AWWs are paid performance linked incentive of Rs 500/- per month for using ICDS-CAS (Common Application Software) under POSHAN Abhiyaan. In addition to this, most of the States/UTs are also providing monetary incentives to these workers out of their own resources.


    Under the Anganwadi Services Scheme, the funding pattern between Centre and States/UTs is as under:

    Presently, there is no proposal under consideration to increase the honorarium of Anganwadi Workers.


    AWWs/AWHs are honorary workers who come forward to render their services on payment of monthly honorarium. In view of the very nature of the role of Anganwadi Workers/Helpers, it is not feasible to declare them as regular/permanent employees. Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in a ruling of 07.12.2006 in Civil Appeal No. 4853-4957 of 1998 – State of Karnataka & Ors. vs. Ameerbi&Ors. has held that Anganwadi Workers/Helpers do not hold any civil post.


    Out of 16 recommendations/ observations made by the Dr. ChandreshKumari Committee, 14 recommendations have been implemented. Pursuant to the observations made by the Committee in its Sixteen Report, Ministry of Women & Child Development has furnished action taken report to the Committee.


    State/UT-wise number of Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) in the country isas under:
