    Mahila Shakti Kendra (MSK) Scheme, under Ministry of Women and Child Development, was approved in November, 2017 as a centrally sponsored scheme to empower rural women through community participation. The scheme aims to facilitate inter-sectoral convergence of schemes and programs meant for women both at the Central and State/UT level. The scheme envisages community engagement through College Student Volunteers in 115 aspirational districts as part of block level initiatives; District Level Centre for Women (DLCW) in 640 districts to facilitate women centric schemes and provide foothold for BBBP scheme; State Resource Centre for Women to support respective government in implementation of women centric schemes/programmes and also function as Project Management Unit for BBBP Scheme with separate funds allocated for State/UT level activities.


    District level Centre for Women (DLCW) has been set up in 14 districts out of 32 approved districts in Tamil Nadu namely, Salem, Chennai, Cuddalore, Virudhanagar, Perambalur, Villupuram, Namakkal, Thiruvannamalai, Trichy, Thiruvallur, Ariyalur, Thanjavur, Theni and Vellore.


    As per MSK Scheme guidelines, at the district level, District Level Task force with District Collector/District Magistrate as the Chair acts as the Selection Committee for recruitment of DLCW staff. As per the information provided by the State Government of Tamil Nadu, setting up of DLCWs was delayed in Tamil Nadu due to local body elections and the subsequent imposition of Model Code of Conduct due to Parliamentary elections.


    Central share of funds is released component wise to all States/UTs. Grant in Aid (GIA) released State/UT-wise under Mahila Shakti Kendra Scheme including Tamil Nadu isas under .
