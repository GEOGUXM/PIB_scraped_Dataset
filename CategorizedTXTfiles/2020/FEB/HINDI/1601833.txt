    Under AB-PMJAY, the State Governments have been given the flexibility to decide on the mode of implementation of the scheme. They can implement the scheme either through insurance companies, or directly through trust/society, or in a mixed mode. The central share of premium is paid based on a market determined rate in such States/ UTs, where AB-PMJAY is implemented through Insurance companies. In States/ UTs, where the scheme is implemented in Trust/ Society mode, the central share of funds are provided as per the actual expenditure. In both the cases, Central Share of premium is subject to upper ceiling of total premium per family per year.


    As on 30.01.2020, the fund released to States/UTs for implementation of AB-PMJAY is as under –

     1. Insurance mode = 258.09 Crore
     2. Mixed mode = 2052.94 Crore
     3. Trust mode = 1237.23 Crore
