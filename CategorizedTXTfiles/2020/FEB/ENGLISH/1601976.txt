    Vacancies in the Central Government are caused due to retirement, resignation, death, promotion etc. and the posts falling vacant are required to be filled as per recruitment rules by the concerned Ministries/ Departments/ Organisations. Filling up of vacant posts is a continuous process depending on the vacancies arising across Ministries/Departments during the year and action calendar of the recruiting agencies.


    During the current year 2019-20, three recruiting agencies namely, Union Public Service Commission, Staff Selection Commission & Railway Recruitment Board have made recommendations for recruitment to the following posts:-

               
UPSC   4,399   
               
               
               
SSC    13,995  
               
               
               
RRB    1,16,391
               
               
               
TOTAL  1,34,785
               
               

    Further, recruiting agencies like SSC, Railway Recruitment Board, Postal Service Board and Ministry of Defence are in process of filling up of 3,10,832 vacant posts, including 27652 vacant posts of defence civilians.


    Recruitment against vacant posts is a continuous process. By the time vacancies reported by a Department get filled up, some new vacancies arise. Where a post remains vacant for more than two years/three years (newly created post), the same becomes “deemed abolished” as per Department of Expenditure OM No. 7(1)/E-Coord-I/2007 dated 12.04.2017. Such posts are revived based on the functional justification. There is no system of abolishing posts in the Railways.


    DOPT issues instructions from time to time for timely and advance action to fill up the vacant posts. Recently, all Ministries/Departments have been requested to take time bound action to fill the existing vacancies in various Ministries/Departments and their attached/subordinate offices vide OM No. 43014/03/2019-Estt(B) dated 21.01.2020.


    To reduce the recruitment cycle, recruiting agencies have switched over to computer based on line test, interview for non-gazetted posts has been discontinued and provisional appointment is being made pending verification of antecedents of the candidates.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
