    The aim of the Government is to make Indian Railways the growth engine of the economy. The emphasis is on continued capacity enhancement through accelerated investments and execution. Five measures relating to Railways have been highlighted in Budget speech.


     1. Setting up a large solar power capacity alongside the rail tracks, on the land owned by the railways. A proposal is under consideration.

     2. Four station re-development projects and operation of 150 passenger trains would be done through PPP mode. The process of inviting private participation is underway.
     3. More Tejas type trains will connect iconic tourist destinations.
     4. High speed train between Mumbai to Ahmedabad would be actively pursued.
     5. 148 km long Bengaluru Suburban transport project at a cost of
        Rs 18600 crore, would have fares on metro model. Central Government would provide 20% of equity and facilitate external assistance up to 60% of the project cost.

    To this end, Government has increased investment and introduced modern technology while focusing on safety, speed and service to passengers. Capex of Indian Railways for 2020-21 has been pegged at an all time high of Rs 1,61,042 crore. Capex for the year 2019-20 is Rs 1,56,352 crore (RE), which is 17.2% higher than the previous year. The target of new lines, gauge conversion and doubling/tripling etc. for 2020-21 is 3750 Route Kms against 3150 Route Kms in 2019-20. Electrification of the entire Broad Gauge network is to be completed by 2023-24. In 2020-21, Electrification of 6000 Route Kms has been targeted. In the Budget Estimate (BE) 2020-21, the freight loading of Indian Railways is kept at 1265 MT which is 42 MT (i.e 3.4%) incremental over Revised Estimate (RE) 2019-20. Average freight lead has been kept at 553 km, and originating passengers kept at 8792 million.


    Railways now plan to induct latest technology for Signalling & Telecommunication system. Under modernization plan of Railway signaling system, it has been decided to implement Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) system on Indian Railways. This will increase operational efficiency. In first phase CTC will be implemented on 1830 KMs over 8 Zonal Railways on sections provided with Automatic Block Signalling system. Further, in the second phase, CTC will be implemented over balance 8 zonal Railways alongwith Automatic Block Signalling system. Government has initiated the upgradation of the decades old signalling system into an Automatic Train Protection System, which will be a mix of proven international technology as well as indigenously developed systems with an impetus to Make in India .


    Facilitating private participation in Railways to build a seamless national cold supply chain for perishables, inclusive of milk, meat and fish, the Indian Railways will set up a “Kisan Rail” – through PPP arrangements. There shall be refrigerated coaches in Express and Freight trains as well.
