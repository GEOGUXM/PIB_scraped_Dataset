    RailMadad, the grievance redressal portal of Indian Railways, has been awarded Silver under Category II of National e-Governance Awards – “Excellence in providing Citizen-centric Delivery”. This award was conferred during the 23 rd National Conference on e-Governance which was held in Mumbai on 7-8 th Feb, 2020. To recognize and promote excellence in implementation of e-Governance initiatives, Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) presents National e-Governance Awards every year. DARPG received more than 500 nominations, out which 20 projects were selected for e-Governance Awards in six categories.
