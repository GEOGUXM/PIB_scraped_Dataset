      * Creation of additional 210 Metric Ton per Day Milk Drying capacity.
      * Modernization, expansion and creation of Milk Processing capacity of 126 Lakh Litres per Day.
      * Creation of Infrastructure of 59.78 Lakh Litres per Day capacity for Value-Added Dairy products to ensure remunerative prices to milk producers.
      * Providing 28000 Milk Testing Equipment to check adulteration in milk.

    
    Implementation Strategy and targets:


    NABARD raises funds from the market, which it lends to NDDB/NCDC @ 6.0% and NDDB/NCDC, in turn, lends it to the Eligible End Borrowers at appropriate interest rate. DAHD provides interest subvention equal to the difference or upto 2.5% between the cost of raising capital by NABARD and the interest rate at which NABARD lends to NDDB/NCDC. In case there is any further increase in the cost of funds, it shall be borne by the end borrowers themselves.


    Targets
