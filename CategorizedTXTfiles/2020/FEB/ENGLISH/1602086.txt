      Posted On: 05 FEB 2020 5:24PM by PIB Delhi


    As regard SC/ST reservation, at present, there is no concept of creamy layer. Hence question of the review of creamy layer does not arise.


    As regard OBC reservation, an Expert Committee has been constituted by the Government of India under the Chairmanship of Shri B.P. Sharma (former Secretary, DOPT) on 08.03.2019 to examine the issues related to Creamy layer equivalence among the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBCs).


    The Expert Committee, after consultation with all stakeholders including the State/UT Governments, has submitted its report to the Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment on 17.09.2019. At present, the report is under consideration.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
