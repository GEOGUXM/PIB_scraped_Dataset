      Posted On: 11 FEB 2020 2:55PM by PIB Delhi


    The population of India is expected to exceed that of China around 2027as per World Population Prospects 2019 Report.


    As per Census 2011, the countryâ€™s Decadal Growth Rate was 17.7%;


    State-wise Decadal Growth Rate is placed in Annexure I.


    The details of Schemes under the National Family Planning Programme are placed at Annexure II.


    The Government conducts periodic surveys viz. the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) and the Sample Registration System (SRS) to study the impact of various awareness programmes being conducted. The key findings of the surveys are as follows:

      * The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) has declined from 2.9 in 2005 to 2.2 in 2017 (SRS).
      * The Wanted Fertility Rate has declined from 1.9 in NFHS III to 1.8 in NFHS IV.
      * The Crude Birth Rate (CBR) has declined from 23.8 to 20.2 from 2005 to 2017 (SRS).
      * The Teenage Birth Rate has halved from 16% (NFHS III) to 8% (NFHS IV).
      * 99.5 percent currently married men and women have knowledge about any modern method of contraception (NFHS IV).

    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
