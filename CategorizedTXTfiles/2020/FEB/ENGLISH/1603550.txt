    It is observed that while the services segment, constituting majorly of IT &ITeS services was driver of the export growth at 23.69 %.Therewas almost 4% growth in manufacturing segment also. This reflects overall expansion and interest in SEZs in the country.Numberof operational SEZs have grown to 241 as against 235 at the end of FY 2018-19.


    Important sectors that saw healthy growth in this financial year include Gems & Jewelry (13.3%), Trading & Logistics (35%), Leather & Footwear (15%), Non-Conventional Energy (47%), Textiles & Garments (17.6%). Petrochemicals constitute a major segment of SEZ exports, howevergrowth was muted in this segment; which may be attributed to softening of global crude prices.
