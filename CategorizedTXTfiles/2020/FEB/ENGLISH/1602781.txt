    Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G Kishan Reddy, in a written reply in Lok Sabha to a question regarding Naxal violence said that incidents of Naxal violence have continuously gone down in the period 2017-19. To combat the Left Wing Extremism (LWE) menace in a holistic manner, the Government of India has formulated a National Policy and Action Plan, which envisages a multi-pronged approach comprising security, development and ensuring rights and entitlements of local communities etc. Resolute implementation of National Policy and Action Plan has resulted in consistent decline in LWE violence and its geographical spread.
