      Decline in Tea Production in Southern States
      Posted On: 07 FEB 2020 5:00PM by PIB Delhi


    The production of tea in South Indian States (Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka) declined from 224.87 Million Kgs. (in 2018) to 219.04 Million Kgs. (in 2019), thereby exhibiting a decline of 2.59% . The tea production in Nilgris exhibited a reduction of 1.99% during 2019 as compared to 2018. The decline in tea production is attributable, inter-alia, to un-even distribution of rain and localized pest infestation.


    This information was given by the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
