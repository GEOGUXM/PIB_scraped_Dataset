    Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan today held a preparatory meeting with senior officials from the ministry and public sector undertakings. He reviewed the preparations and instructed officials to accelerate the efforts, in wake of the planned country-wide rollout of BS-VI on 1st April 2020.


    Shri Pradhan said that this bold step to leapfrog from BS-IV to BS-VI grade fuel is a testimony of Modi Government’s efforts towards achieving the commitments made at COP 21. It is also part of an overall strategy to improve ease of living for citizens. He also said that this rollout will be with the spirit of the Government to dedicate “HarKaamDeshKeNaam.”


    BS-VI, which is comparable with CNG in terms of providing clean energy, is expected to bring down sulphur level by 5 times from the BS-IV levels. This will go a long way in mitigating the problem of air pollution and improving air quality.
