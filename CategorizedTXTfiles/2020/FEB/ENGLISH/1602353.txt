    As informed by Central Pollution Control Board and as per Bio-medical Waste Management Rules, 2016, Bio-medical waste is required to be segregated in 4 color coded waste categories, and the same is treated and disposed as per the specified methods of disposal prescribed under Schedule I of the Rules.


    Bio-medical waste generated from the hospitals shall be treated and disposed by Common Bio-medical Waste Treatment and Disposal Facility. In case there is no common facility in the reach of a healthcare facility, then such healthcare facility should install captive treatment and disposal facility. There are 200 authorized Common Bio-medical Waste Treatment and Disposal Facilities (CBWTFs) in 28 States for environmentally safe disposal of biomedical waste. Remaining 7 States namely Goa, Andaman Nicobar, Arunachal Pradesh, Lakshadweep, Mizoram, Nagaland and Sikkim do not have CBWTFs. Apart from common facilities, there are 12,296 number of captive treatment and disposal facilities installed by Healthcare Facilities. Every healthcare facility, both bedded and non-bedded is required to take authorization from concerned State Pollution Control Board / Pollution Control Committee (SPCB/PCC) for management of Biomedical waste. As per annual report for the year 2018, there are 2,60,889 number of healthcare facilities generating about 608 MT per day of Bio-medical Waste, out of which 528 MT of Bio-medical Waste is treated and disposed through either CBWTF or Captive disposal facility.


    Common methods of treatment and disposal of bio-medical waste are by incineration/plasma pyrolysis/deep-burial for Yellow Category waste; autoclaving/microwaving/chemical disinfection for Red Category waste; sterilization and shredding, disinfection followed by burial in concrete pit/recycling through foundry/encapsulation for White Category sharps waste; and washing, disinfection followed by recycling for Blue Category glass waste.


    As per Annual report information received from State Pollution Control Boards / Pollution Control Committees (SPCBs/PCCs) for the year 2018, about 27427 instances of violations under Bio-medical Waste Management Rules, 2016 were reported against Healthcare Facilities (HCFs) or Common Biomedical Waste Treatment and Disposal Facilities (CBWTFs); out of which 16,960 number of HCFs/CBWTFs were given Show Cause Notices/Directions by concerned SPCB/PCCs for such violations. During the last 3 years, SPCBs/PCCs have issued about 46,442 nos of notices/directions to HCFs/CBWTFs.


    Central Pollution Control Board conducted random inspection of HCFs/CBWTFs to verify compliance and taken action under section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 against 33 nos. of HCFs/CBWTFs during the year 2019.


    Central Pollution Control Board has been following up with all SPCBs/PCCs to ensure effective management of biomedical waste in States/UTs. CPCB has also prepared following guidelines to facilitate the stakeholders to ensuring proper treatment and disposal of Bio-medical Waste in line with provisions of Bio-medical Waste Management Rules, 2016;

     1. Revised Guidelines for Common Bio-medical Waste Treatment and Disposal Facilities.
     2. Guidelines for Management of Healthcare Waste in Health Care Facilities as per Bio Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016
     3. Guidelines for Bar Code System for Effective Management of Bio-Medical Waste
     4. Guidelines for Handling of Biomedical Waste for Utilization
     5. Environmentally Sound Management of Mercury Waste Generated from Health Care Facilities.
     6. Guidelines for "Imposition of Environmental Compensation against HCFs and CBWTFs"
     7. Guidelines for Verification of Two Seconds Residence Time in Secondary Combustion Chamber of the Biomedical Waste Incinerator

    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
