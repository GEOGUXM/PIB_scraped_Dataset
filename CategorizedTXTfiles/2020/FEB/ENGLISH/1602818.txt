    Apart from deleterious impact on the academic, social, psychological, physiological and economic development of the people consuming drugs, the drug menace also imposes a high cost on their families. To further boost the public awareness of the perils of the drug abuse, mass media coverage was initiated to witness the destruction of the seized drugs substances at various places across the country.


    The efforts of the Customs Department in acting a bulwark against curbing the drug menace in general and as an alert enforcement agency against the import of banned substances in particular, were appreciated on the occasion.
