    The Railways is undertaking measures for improving speed of both passenger and freight trains. Improvement in average speed of trains is a continuous exercise for Railways. Indian Railway is constructing more than 3000 Km of Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC), which would enable freight trains to run at speed of 100 kmph. Further, the Government in August 2019, has approved two projects for raising of speed to 160 kmph on existing New Delhi-Mumbai (including Vadodara-Ahmedabad) and New Delhi- Howrah (including Kanpur-Lucknow) routes. These routes are part of Golden Quadrilateral and Diagonals of Indian Railways, which consist of 16% of Indian Railways network, yet carry 52% of total passenger traffic and 58% of total freight traffic carried by Indian Railways.


    1318 Km of Eastern DFC, 1504 Km of Western DFC and the two projects of raising of speed of New Delhi-Mumbai and New Delhi-Howrah routes shall be completed within the next five year period.


    This information was given by the Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
