The amount is proposed to carry forward to FY 2019-20. It is to mention that contribution to Prime Minister National Relief Fund or Chief Minister Flood Relief Fund is not considered as CSR expenditure. Therefore, Disaster Preparedness or Relief Work through direct implementation or implementing agency will consider as CSR expenditure.
