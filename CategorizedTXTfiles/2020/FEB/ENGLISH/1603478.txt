    The Union Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports, Shri Kiren Rijiju has said that Sports must be given a structured format to make India as a mega sporting country. He was addressing the gathering after launching the Theme Song of Khelo India University Games 2020, here today.


    Shri Kien Rijiju said that all the nations in the world which have gone on to become sporting powerhouses have invested heavily in their University structure. He further said that it is the first time that such a professionally organized championship is happening at the university level. I would like to thank Indian Oil Corporation who has come on board as the primary sponsor partner for the Khelo India University Games 2020, he added.


    The massive success of the first 3 editions of Khelo India Youth Games (KIYG), has paved the way for the Government of India to launch the first season of the Khelo India University Games (KIUG).
