    In 2016, Ministry of Culture was given the task of establishing Virtual Museums in at least 50 locations. Subsequently, Ministry of Culture has developed three Virtual Experiential Museums: - Man Mahal at Varanasi, Ajanta Caves at National Musuem, Delhi and Humayun Tomb in Delhi (last two are under development). Ministry of Culture also proposes to set up a National Virtual Experiential Site Museum at Vadnagar, Gujarat.


    Ministry of Tourism under its schemes of ‘Swadesh Darshan’ and ‘Development of Iconic sites’, has developed tourism infrastructure at various heritage destinations.


    Under both these schemes, the primary objective is to develop the identified destinations as benchmark tourist destinations in terms of comprehensive development of infrastructure & services.


    However, under both the above-mentioned schemes, interventions involving reconstruction of historic sites are not permissible.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (I/c) of Culture and Tourism, Shri Prahlad Singh Patel in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
