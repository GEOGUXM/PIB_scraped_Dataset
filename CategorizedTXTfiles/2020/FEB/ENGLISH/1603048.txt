      EBSB KALARIPPAYTTU DEMONSTRATION- GANDHINAGAR


      The players from all the participating paired States/UTs enjoyed playing these championship events with a unique concept of Joint teams of Paired States, which helped in better understanding of culture and food habits of each other. Colourful inauguration and closing ceremony were performed for each of the events in which local children performed welcome songs and folk dances in colourful folk dresses.


      Prime Minister Narendra Modi had mooted the idea of a cultural connect between different regions during the Rashtriya Ekta Divas held in 2015. The broad objectives of Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat include celebrating the Unity in Diversity of our nation and promoting the spirit of national integration through engagement between all states and union territories.


      An activity calendar for each pair is prepared through mutual consultation, paving the way for a year long process of mutual engagement. The current pairings will continue till June this year. After the creation of Union Territory of Ladakh, it has been paired along with Jammu and Kashmir with Tamil Nadu. Punjab has been paired with Andhra Pradesh, Uttarakhand with Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh with Kerala, Delhi with Sikkim, and Rajasthan with Assam.
