    Great Saint Guru Ravidas was a prophet of peace, love, truth and social reawakening. He was a champion of human values which are extremely relevant in the contemporary world. As a social reformer, he was also concerned about well-being of women, downtrodden and poor.


    In his discourses, he taught us simplicity and discretion. He lived an exemplary life full of faith, devotion and service of humanity. He believed that service of mankind is service to God.


    Let us follow the path shown by him and make it the objective of our lives to put into practice the values he preached.”
