    Indiaâ€™s crude steel production in 2018 was at 109.3 MT, an increase of 7.7 per cent from 101.5 MT in 2017.


    Steel being a deregulated sector, the Government does not set any annual targets for steel production. Decision on quantity of steel production is taken by individual companies based on commercial considerations and market requirements.


    This information was given by the Union Minister of Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan in the Rajya Sabha today in a written reply today.
