    A study team is preparing the road map for creation of an Air Defence Command.


    The purpose of the road map is to come up with proposal of integrating the Air Defence resources of the different services under a single agency, so as to ensure jointness and optimisation of resources, procedures and communication arrangements.


    Three Joint Logistic Nodes (JLNs) are being established at Mumbai, Guwahati and Port Blair for Logistics Integration between the three services.
