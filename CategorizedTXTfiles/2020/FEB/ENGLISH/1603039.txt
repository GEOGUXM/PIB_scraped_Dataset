    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, presented ‘Colour’ to the INS Shivaji in Lonavala, Maharashtra today (February 13, 2020).


    Speaking on the occasion, the President said that INS Shivaji has distinguished itself with stellar service to the nation over the years. It has a proud record of professional excellence, and has discharged its responsibilities with distinction. The nation salutes it for its dedication and devotion to duty. We are all proud of achievements of INS Shivaji and appreciate its remarkable contribution to the Indian Navy.


    The President said that a nation’s maritime interests are usually also linked to its economy and the well-being of its people.

India’s rise in the international order has been fuelled by many factors including the capabilities and valour of our armed forces.
