    As Public Health is a State subject, opening of Yoga Centres at block level in the country comes under the purview of respective State/UT Government. However, Central Government is implementing Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National AYUSH Mission (NAM) in the country under which financial assistance of Rs. 6.00 lakhs per unit (Rs. 0.6 Lakhs as one time assistance for initial furnishing and recurring assistance of Rs.5.4 Lakhs for manpower, maintenance etc.) is provided to States/UTs for setting up of Yoga Wellness Centre. State/UT Governments may avail eligible financial assistance by projecting the same through State Annual Action Plan (SAAP) as per NAM guidelines.
