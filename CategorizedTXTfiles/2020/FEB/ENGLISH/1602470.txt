      Fall in Production of Sugar
      Posted On: 07 FEB 2020 5:59PM by PIB Delhi


    In the current sugar season 2019-20, the sugar mills in the country have produced about 14.1 million tonnes of sugar till January, 2020, as against 18.6 million tonnes in the corresponding period of previous sugar season, which is down by about 24 per cent.


    The decline in sugar production is due to fall in the production of sugarcane mainly in the major sugar producing states of Maharashtra and Karnataka, due to drought in some parts and heavy rains and floods in some other parts of these states.


    With the carry over stock of about 145 Lakh MT of previous sugar season and estimated production of about 273 Lakh MT in current sugar season 2019-20, the availability of sugar is sufficient to meet the domestic consumption of about 260 Lakh MT. In view of sufficient availability of sugar in the country, the sugar prices in the domestic market are expected to remain stable.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution Shri Danve Raosaheb Dadarao in Rajya Sabha today.
