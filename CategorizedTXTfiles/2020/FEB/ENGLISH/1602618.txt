    (iv) reduction in Goods & Service Tax on ethanol meant for EBP Programme from 18% to 5%,


    (v) increased the scope of raw material by allowing production of ethanol from damaged food grains which are unfit for human consumption, fruit and vegetable wastes, etc.,


    (vi) interest subvention scheme for financial assistance for sugar industry to increase distillation capacity, and
