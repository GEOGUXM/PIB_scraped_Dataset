      Implementation of One Nation One Ration Card System
      Posted On: 04 FEB 2020 4:31PM by PIB Delhi


    Under PDS reforms, a scheme on “Integrated Management of Public Distribution System (IM-PDS)” is being implemented w.e.f. April 2018 in all States/UTs including Tamil Nadu. The main objective of the scheme is to introduce nation-wide portability of ration card holders under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA), through 'One Nation One Ration Card' system. This system enables the migratory ration card holders/beneficiaries to lift their entitled foodgrains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) of their choice in the country by using their existing/same ration card issued in their home State/UT after biometric/Aadhaar authentication on electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) devices installed at the FPSs. In this regard, Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the implementation of IM-PDS scheme have been signed with most of the States/UTs including Tamil Nadu.


    Under this initiative, there is no added burden on any State/UT, as the quota of foodgrains distributed to other States’/UTs’ beneficiaries through national portability, shall be periodically reconciled and adjusted between concerned States/UTs. Further, existing system of foodgrains distribution by States/UTs to own beneficiaries remains same/ unaltered, as this system intends to largely benefit the migratory beneficiaries under NFSA who frequently change their place of dwelling in search of employment, etc. across the country.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister Of State For Ministry Of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution Shri Danve Raosaheb Dadarao in Lok Sabha today.
