     2. To meet the domestic demand for high performance steel, the Government, is facilitating R&D in the sector through the establishment of Steel Research and Technology Mission of India (SRTMI).
     3. The Ministry is addressing the issue of quality of steel products that are produced as well as block import of sub-standard steel. It has notified Steel and Steel Products Quality Control (QC) Orders.
     4. To prevent import due to unfair trade, the government has imposed Anti-Dumping Duty on a number of steel products imports.
     5. To reduce dependence on imported steel scrap, the government has notified the Steel Scrap Recycling Policy.
     6. The Government has recently introduced Steel Imports Monitoring System (SIMS) to monitor steel imports.

    Import duties on basic raw materials used by the steel industry, such as coking coal, ferro scrap, iron ore, ferro-alloys etc. is at a lower level.
