      Posted On: 03 FEB 2020 3:47PM by PIB Delhi


    Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (2016 - 2020) is the flagship outcome-based Skill Training Scheme of the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE) which aims to train 10 million youths by 2020 pan India both in Rural and Urban areas. MSDE does not maintain any segregated data for rural and urban areas. There are three training routes under the scheme: Short term Training for fresh skilling of school / college drop outs and unemployed youth, Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) to recognize the existing skills and Special Projects to address skilling requirements of groups which are under represented or require special initiatives and efforts. RPL only provides orientation to the already skilled workforce, and does not mandate placements.


    Under PMKVY 2016-2020, Training Centres make all efforts to facilitate placements of certified candidates through multiple initiatives like Rojgar Melas and collaboration with industries and Sector Skill Council. Also, candidates can avail benefit of placement through ‘Yuva Sampark’ portal which brings both candidate and potential employer on IT platform to find potential match between two (employer and candidate).


    The details of candidates who have been benefited under PMKVY as on January 17, 2020, data reported in Systematic Data Management System reports is at (Annexure -I)


    Directorate General of Training (DGT) under MSDE is entrusted with the responsibility of long term vocational training in the Country. One of the flagship schemes is ‘Craftsmen Training Scheme’ being implemented through network of 15,042 Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) (Govt. 2738 + Private 12,304 ITIs) located all over the country with an objective to provide skilled work force to the industry in 138 trades with duration of 6 months , 1 year and 2 year. Initiatives for improving quality of ITIs include, formulation of new affiliation norms, grading to evaluate their performance, ISO 29990 certification to raise the overall quality and standards, regular inspection of ITIs, regular up-gradation of training content of ITI curriculum as per industrial requirement etc. The details of the candidates who have been benefited under Craftsmen Training Scheme are at Annexure-II.


    Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), a placement linked skill development program for rural poor youth under National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) all over the country. Every candidate undergoing training under DDU-GKY is given mandatory basic training in Information Technology for 80 Hours. During the year 2019-20 (upto October 31st, 2019) 1,27,918 candidates have been provided training.
