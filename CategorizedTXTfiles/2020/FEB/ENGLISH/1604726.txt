Minister of State for Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Shri Babul Supriyo, inaugurated this first of its kind restaurant in a programme held at Asansol station on 26 th February, 2020. Shri Babul Supriyo also inaugurated two new air-conditioned Retiring Rooms and Electronic Reservation Chart Display System (through MPLAD fund) and a Battery operated Car at Asansol station.

The two new air-conditioned Retiring Rooms equipped with the state-of-the-art furniture and other equipment will provide much comfort to the passengers. The battery operated car will be very helpful for the Divyangjan and senior citizen passengers for their comfortable movement at the station area.
