    Fixation of rates for transportation of goods by rail is done based on certain cardinal principles, which include cost of service, value of service, competition from alternate mode of transports, socio-economic condition etc.


    Evaluation of various alternatives relating to rationalization of the fare and freight structures is an on-going process. At present, there is no such proposal. However, with effect from 01.01.2020, the passenger fares have been rationalized. Salient features of this rationalization are as under:-


      * Suburban and Season ticket no increase.

      * Ordinary (Non-AC) non-suburban increase @1 paisa per km.
      * Non-AC Classes of Mail/Express trains increase @2 paise per km.
      * AC classes increase @4 paise per km.

    Estimated annual additional earning of ₹ 2312.36 cr is likely to be generated with the rationalisation of passenger fare w.e.f. 01.01.2020. However, in respect of freight segment, Indian Railway took the following initiatives:-

      * Busy Season Charge, which is levied @ 15% from 1st Oct to 30th June, has been deferred till further advice (Except for iron ore and POL). Coal & coke and container traffic are already exempted.
      * Withdrawal of 5% supplementary charge from Mini Rake and Two Point Rake combination to make the rail rates competitive.
      * Distance for Mini Rake operation has been relaxed upto 1000 km for Intra Zonal traffic. Mini rakes are also booked under lower train load rates.
      * Round-trip haulage charge for container traffic (for 0-50 km) minimum distance slab has been introduced which is around 35% cheaper per TEU/round trip.

    This information was given by the Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
