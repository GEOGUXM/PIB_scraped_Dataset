    NTEP has policy of provision of free drugs to all TB patients in public as well as private sector. However, approximately 8% of TB patients notified from private sector availed free anti-TB drugs from the Government.


    Mechanism to provide free anti-TB drugs for TB patients include – referral of TB patients to public sector health facility or by dispensing anti-TB drugs at private clinics and pharmacies. Decision on either option of provision of drugs depends on the patients and providers’ interaction and convenience


    For achieving the target, the programme has actively pursued to advocate with private clinics to prescribe free drugs, the supply chain system is being strengthened with support of the field level staff in the States/ UTs and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) at many places and inventory management system - NIKSHAY Aushadhi is deployed.
