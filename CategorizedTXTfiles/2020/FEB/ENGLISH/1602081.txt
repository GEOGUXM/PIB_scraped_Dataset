      Reservation for Economically Weaker Section
      Posted On: 05 FEB 2020 5:23PM by PIB Delhi


    10% reservation under Economically Weaker Section ( EWS) category is applicable to those persons who are not covered under the existing scheme of reservations for the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes. No relaxation in age, number of attempts, fees etc. is available to such candidates as on date.


    The Constitution (One Hundred and Third Amendment) Act 2019 passed by the Parliament of India enables the State (i.e both the Central and State Governments) to provide reservation to the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) of the society. Whether or not to provide reservation to the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) of the society for appointment in State Government jobs and for admission to State Government educational institutions, as per provisions of the newly inserted Articles 15(6) and 16(6) of the constitution, is to be decided by the concerned State Government.


    The services under the State come under the List II of the Seventh Schedule i.e. State List of the Constitution. The information on the state-wise provisions for reservation is not maintained by the Central Government.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
