    At present, there is no proposal to withdraw the concessions given to Indian senior citizens and other categories of passengers. However, in view of increase in revenue foregone year after year due to concessions being given to different categories of passengers, the following action have already been taken:-

     1. Senior Citizens of foreign nationals and Non-resident Indians have been excluded from the senior citizen category for the purpose of concession in passenger fare.
     2. No concession has been given in the newly introduced trains like Humsafar, Antyodaya, Gatimaan, Vande Bharat etc.
     3. With effect from 22.07.2017, senior citizen passengers now can opt to give up 50% of the concession in addition to the existing option of giving up 100% concession.
     4. No new concession has been given during the last 5 years.

    This information was given by the Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
