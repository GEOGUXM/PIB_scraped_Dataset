    Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, chaired a meeting of the CSIR society in New Delhi.


    Prime Minister was given an overview of the work done by CSIR. He appreciated the tasks undertaken and also gave his suggestions to chart out a future road map.


    Prime Minister stressed on the importance of developing virtual labs so that science can further be taken to all segments of the students in each and every corner of the country. He spoke about the need to attract young students toward science and further strengthen scientific acumen in the next generation. He also suggested measures to enhance collaboration in R&D projects amongst Indians working in different parts of the world.


    Asking the scientists to work on the aspirational needs of India, he said that there is a need for CSIR to focus on real-time social issues that India is facing such as malnutrition - through value addition in agriculture products - and water conservation.


    Prime Minister listed 5G, AI and affordable and long lasting batteries for renewable energy storage as some of the emerging challenges which the scientists need to focus on. He highlighted the need to combine traditional knowledge and modern science to develop world class products. He also spoke about the importance of commercialisation of innovations.
