    Human Resource Development Ministry Secretary,Mr. Amit Khare, said that he had held detailed discussions with the Vice-Chancellor –VC of Delhi University regarding the problems of Ad-hoc teachers and has asked the VC to take steps for filling the vacant faculty positions and also for promotion of teachers.


    He was speaking at the inauguration of the New Wing of Shivaji College, Delhi. During his speech, Amit Khare said that teachers are the backbone of the education system and while working for quality education, we should also focus on resolving the challenges being faced by the teaching community.


    During the inaugural function, Shri Khare paid tributes to ChatrapatiShivajiMaharaj and said that it is both pertinent and meaningful that the new block is named after MatashreeJijabai, Shivaji’s mother who played a definitive role in his upbringing.


    This new block has been constructed under the leadership of the principal, Dr. Shashi Nijhawan. The building has state of the art infrastructure, including laboratories, seminar halls, auditoriums, classrooms and many other facilities for students and faculty.


    Mr. Khare congratulated Dr.Nijhawan and the faculty for this meaningful addition to the college and said that it has added both quantitatively and qualitatively to the college infrastructure and to the pedagogic and mentoring process. He also said that naming the Academic Block in the name of Mata Jijabai also reflects on the women empowerment.


    Shivaji College is now the second institution of the University of Delhi to have a Finance Lab, a great advantage for the student to gain hands- on knowledge of different processes.
