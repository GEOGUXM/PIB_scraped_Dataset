    The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act) is the primary law for children in country. The Act provides a security net of service delivery structures including measures for institutional and non-institutional care to ensure comprehensive wellbeing of children in distress situations. As per the JJ Act, destitute children are considered as “Children in need of care and protection (CNCP). The primary responsibility of execution of the Act lies with the States/UTs.


    The Government of India has implemented the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 which is a comprehensive law that provides protection to children from the offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography. The Act provides mandatory reporting, child friendly provisions of recording of statement and evidence and speedy trial of the cases. Recently, the POCSO Act has been amended in order to make it more effective in dealing with cases of child sex abuse in the country. It addresses the need for stringent measures to deter the rising trend of child sex abuse in the country on one hand and the menace of relatively new kind of crimes on the other hand.


    The Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing a centrally sponsored Child Protection Services (CPS) Scheme (erstwhile Integrated Child Protection Scheme) for supporting the children in difficult circumstances.


    The primary responsibility of implementation of the scheme lies with the State Governments/UT Administrations. Under the scheme institutional care is provided through Child Care Institutes (CCIs), as a rehabilitative measure. The programmes and activities in Homes inter-alia include age-appropriate education, access to vocational training, recreation, health care, counselling etc. Under the non-institutional care component, support is extended for adoption, foster care and sponsorship. Further CPS also provides for “After care” services after the age of 18 years to help sustain them during the transition from institutional to independent life. The details of CCIs under CPS scheme as informed by the States/UTs during 2019-20 is at Annexure-I . Details of the funds released to the States/UTs under the said schemes during the last three years the current year, is at Annexure-II. Further, under Section 41 of the Act, registration of institutions including Homes for children in conflict with law has been made mandatory with penalty in case of non-compliance. The State Governments/UT Administrations, as per Section 54 of the JJ Act, are required to conduct regular inspection and monitor the CCIs to ensure that the institutions are run as per the provisions of the Act and the Model Rules, 2016 framed there-under.
