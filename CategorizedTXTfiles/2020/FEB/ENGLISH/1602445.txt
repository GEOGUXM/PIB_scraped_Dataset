    The Government amended the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy on Pharmaceutical sector in June 2016 by allowing 100% FDI for Greenfield Pharmaceutical projects and upto 74% FDI for Brownfield pharmaceutical projects through automatic route and beyond that through government’s approval.


    FDI is largely a matter of private business decisions and FDI inflows depend on a host of factors such as availability of natural resource, market size, infrastructure, political and general investment climate as well as macro-economic stability and investment decision of foreign investors.
