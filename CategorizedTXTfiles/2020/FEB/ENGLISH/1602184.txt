      Posted On: 06 FEB 2020 12:49PM by PIB Delhi


    District Youth Convention Programme is one of the core programs organized by Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan (NYKS). It is a one day programme in which 100 youth leaders from Youth Clubs participate. Issues of social and national importance are highlighted. Resource Persons provide orientation to youth leaders on addressing local and contemporary issues. Youth leaders also share experience/best practices. Youth Leaders in turn disseminate the acquired inputs among members of their respective youth clubs.


    Rs. 30,000/- per convention per district per year is allocated to each of the district Nehru Yuva Kendras for conduct of District Youth Convention Programme. Details of number of Youth Convention Programmes organized in States/UTs/Districts, during the last three years and current year (upto December, 2019) are at Annexure . This is an ongoing programme. Experience sharing amongst youth leaders has been included in this program.
