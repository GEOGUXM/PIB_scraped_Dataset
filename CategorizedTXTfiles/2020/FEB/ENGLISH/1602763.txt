    Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Nityanand Rai, in a written reply in Lok Sabha to a question regarding detection, arrest and deportation of illegal infiltrators on Indo-Bangladesh border said that the Government has adopted a multi-pronged approach which inter-alia includes round the clock surveillance and patrolling on the borders and establishment of observation post; construction of border fencing & floodlighting; introduction of modern and Hi-Tech surveillance equipments; upgradation of intelligence setup and enhanced coordination with the State Governments and concerned intelligence agencies.


    Technological solutions are being used for vulnerable areas where physical fencing is not feasible, on a pilot basis to begin with, on Indo-Pakistan Border and Indo-Bangladesh Border. The technological solutions are based on integration of sensors and surveillance equipments like radars, day and night vision cameras etc in a network architecture with command and control system.
