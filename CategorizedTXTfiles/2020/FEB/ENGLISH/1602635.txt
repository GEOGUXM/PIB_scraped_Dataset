      Proposals for Construction of Dams
      Posted On: 10 FEB 2020 4:17PM by PIB Delhi


    Twenty seven project proposals involving construction of new dams in different States have been received in Central Water Commission (CWC) since April, 2016. Out of these, 7 proposals have been accepted by Advisory Committee of DoWR, RD & GR and 5 proposals have been returned to the State Governments due to the deficiencies. Details of these projects are at Annexure-I . Acceptance of remaining proposals by the Advisory Committee depends upon satisfactory compliances by the concerned State Governments on the observations of CWC.


    As intimated by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, 11 projects have been granted Environmental Clearance (EC) for the construction of dams from 01.01.2017 to 31.12.2019. Environmental Clearance has been given after duly appraising the individual EIA & EMP reports, consideration of Public Hearing and Rehabilitation & Resettlement issues and including merits and development of the area with respect to the projects. Thereafter, when EAC recommended the grant of Environmental Clearance to these projects, approval from the Competent Authority has been taken for grant of Environmental Clearance. The list of 11 projects which have been granted Environmental Clearance is at Annexure-II.


    This information was given by the Union Minister of State for Jal Shakti & Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Rattan Lal Kataria in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
