      Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


      Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:


      1.1 Crude oil production by ONGC during January, 2020 was 1788.92 TMT which is 1.24 higher when compared with January, 2019 but 11.06% lower than the target for the month. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-January, 2019-20 was 17175.88 TMT which is 5.48% and 2.82% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      Ø Non realization of production from WO-16 cluster due to unavailability of MOPU.


      Ø Less production from Mumbai High, Heera, Neelam & B173A, B-127 Cluster fields due to increase in water cut.


      1.2 Crude oil production by OIL during January, 2020 was 257.55 TMT which is 1.08 higher when compared with January, 2019 but 12.64% lower than the target for the month. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-January, 2019-20 was 2612.29 TMT which is 8.47% and 5.74% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      Ø Less than planned contribution from workover and drilling wells.


      Ø Less than planned contribution from Old well- Rise in water cut in wells & Decline in total liquid production of wells as a consequential effect of the wells shut-in during bandh.


      1.3 Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during January, 2020 was 650.30 TMT which is lower by 16.12% than the monthly target and 21.26% lower than January, 2019. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-January, 2019-20 was 7284.17 TMT which is 8.83% and 12.65% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      Ø RJ-ON-90/1-Mangala (CEIL): Delay in making 45 FM-1/4 infill wells on line. Lag in liquidating the inventory of planned work overs and production optimization jobs. ESP failure in FM-3 well M-357, M-359 and M-387.


      Ø Operational issues in Bhagyam, Aishwarya and ABH fields. (CEIL)

      Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production


      2.1 Natural gas production by ONGC during January, 2020 was 2050.75 MMSCM which is 10.59% lower than target and 5.49 % lower when compared with January 2019. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC during April-January, 2019-20 was 19969.65 MMSCM which is 6.27% and 2.99% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively.


      Ø Less Gas production from Vasistha/S1 wells in EOA and from DDW#5 in HPHT Asset.


      Ø Non-realization of gas production planned from WO16 cluster due to unavailability of MOPU.


      Ø Less than planned gas production from Bassein field and Daman Tapti Block due to higher than envisaged decline.


      Ø Less gas off take by consumers.


      2.2 Natural gas production by OIL during January, 2020 was 208.48 MMSCM which is 21.20% lower than monthly target and 6.21% lower than January, 2019. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-January, 2019-20 was 2255.85 MMSCM which is 19.39% and 1.19% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Major reason for shortfall in production is less gas withdrawal by major customers owing to shutdown of their plants and bandh.


      2.3 Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during January, 2020 was 347.44 MMSCM which is 23.62% lower than monthly target and 22.69% higher than January, 2019. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-January, 2019 was 4201.73 MMSCM which is 7.50% and 9.10% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Major reason for shortfall in production is less offtake by consumers and zone pressure depletions in some wells, water ingress issue and tubing damage in RJ-ON/6 (FEL).


      Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)


      Refinery production during January, 2020 was 21679.19 TMT which is 2.86% lower than the target for the month and 1.21% lower when compared with January, 2019. Cumulative production during April-January, 2019-20 was 212064.08 TMT which is marginally higher by 0.54% than the target for the period but 1.19% lower than production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III . Company-wise production for the month of January, 2020 and cumulatively for the period April-January, 2019-20 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

      Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production


      3.1 CPSE Refineries’ production during January, 2020 was 12393.11 TMT which is 8.93% lower than the target for the month and 5.72% lower when compared with January, 2019. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-January, 2019-20 was 120285.43 TMT which is 1.12% and 4.75% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


      1. IOCL-Guwahati, Mathura and Bongaigaon: Deferment of shutdown.


      3 IOCL- Barauni: High DHT feed stock on account of lower SKO upliftment and Naphtha containment.


      4 IOCL- Gujarat: High VR and DHDT feed stock ; Lower Low NG & SG crude supply


      5 IOCL- Haldia: Extension of CDU and HGU-2 revamp shutdown.


      6 IOCL- Panipat: Marginally lower than plan due to high intermediate stocks.


      7 HPCL-Mumbai: Lower due to Lube refinery Vacuum distillation unit shutdown.


      8 NRL- Numaligarh: Lower due to refinery shutdown.


      9 MRPL-Mangalore: Lower due to reduction in throughput on account of economics.


      3.2 Production in JV refineries during January, 2020 was 1807.39 TMT which is 13.82% higher when compared with the production of January, 2019 and 7.62% higher than the target for the month. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-January, 2019-20 was 16776.48 TMT which is 6.99% and 13.75 higher than the target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year.


      3.3 Production in private refineries during January, 2020 was 7478.69 TMT which is 5.03% higher than the target as well as corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-January, 2019-20 was 75002.17 TMT which is 1.91% higher than the target as well as corresponding period of last year.


      3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of January, 2020 and cumulatively for the period April-January, 2019-20 vis-à-vis April-January, 2018-19 are given at Annexures - IV and V respectively.
