    Based on threat assessment and security imperatives, Government constantly reviews the national security scenarios and takes steps to induct appropriate defence equipment to meet the security challenges and operational requirements. This is a continuous process undertaken through procurement from various indigenous as well as foreign sources. Highest priority is accorded to optimally equip the Armed Forces and keep them in a state of readiness.
