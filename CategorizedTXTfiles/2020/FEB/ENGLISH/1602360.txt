      Immunisation Coverage
      Posted On: 07 FEB 2020 12:54PM by PIB Delhi


    The immunization coverage in the country is at 92.2% (as per HMIS for April 2019 to Dec 2019). However there are still pockets of low coverage. The reasons for low immunization coverage identified are: (i) lack of awareness of benefit of Immunization, (ii) apprehensions of Adverse Effect Following Immunization (AEFI), (iii) travelling of children, (iv) refusal for vaccination and (v) operational gaps. To mitigate the identified reasons of low immunization coverage, strategic interventions like advocacy, social mobilization, community engagement, inter personal communication at family level and media engagement are undertaken.


    Hence, special vaccination drives like Mission Indradhanush, Intensified Mission Indradhanush, Gram Swaraj Abhiyaan (GSA), Extended GSA have been carried out to reach the left out and drop out children from vaccination.


    The State/UT-wise percentage of immunization coverage is placed given below:
