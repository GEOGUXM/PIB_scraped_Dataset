      Posted On: 10 FEB 2020 3:40PM by PIB Delhi


    Government of India (Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas) makes allocation of Public Distribution System (PDS) Kerosene for cooking and lighting purpose on quarterly basis to States/UTs. PDS Kerosene allocation of States/UTs has been/is being rationalized taking into account various factors including increase in domestic LPG/PNG connections, electricity coverage, non-lifting of PDS Kerosene quota by the concerned States/UTs etc. Some States have been voluntarily surrendering PDS Kerosene in view of increased penetration of domestic LPG/PNG connections and Rural electrification. On account of voluntary surrender of PDS Kerosene the States/UTs have been claiming cash incentive under DBT Kerosene Scheme. The Government continues to modulate the retail selling price of PDS Kerosene and its consumers get the product at subsidized price.


    The allocation of subsidized kerosene to the State of Tamil Nadu and Kerala during the year 2019-20 is as under:
