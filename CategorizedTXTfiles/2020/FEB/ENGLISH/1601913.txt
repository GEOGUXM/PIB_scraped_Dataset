    As per 19th Livestock Census 2012, there are 190.90 million numbers of cattle in the country owned by 65 million numbers of households. In a cooperative system, farmers owning milch cattle organise dairy cooperative societies (DCS) at village level where they pour milk. The milk so collected from a cluster of such DCS are stored and cooled in BMCs located at one of these DCS. DAHD provides assistance for BMCs to dairy cooperatives for installation at village level dairy cooperative societies to cool and preserve milk. In Rajasthan, as on December 2019, there are 2686 number of BMCs with installed capacity of 4410 Thousand Litre and 15017 numbers of registered dairy cooperative societies covering 8.20 lakh farmers.
