    Only three grades namely 14,18 and 22 carats for gold jewellery and artefacts, as prescribed in Indian Standard IS: 1417: 2016 can be hallmarked.

The average number of articles hallmarked per day per centre in the year is nearly 225 only. A typical centre can hallmark 500 pieces per shift (or about 1500 pieces per day) with one set of machines. Thus, the average utilization of the capacity of the A&H centres is less than 50 % and therefore, the average utilization of the capacity of the A&H centres is less than 50% and as on date there is no capacity constraint.

Many of these awareness programmes are conducted in association with Consumer Organizations.
