      JNPT, a Major Contributor to India’s Growth Story
      Posted On: 26 MAY 2020 7:03PM by PIB Mumbai


      Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), India’s premier container port has been continuously evolving and upgrading to improve operational efficiency parameters. The port’s continuous growth and expansion has helped JNPT to perform its duties of a strategic contributor to nation building.


      In the current scenario too, overcoming the impact of COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown challenges, the port remained operational as part of essential services and played a crucial role in keeping the global supply chain active by ensuring the availability of essential goods to sustain the national and international needs. The lockdown has underlined the indispensable role of the shipping sector in nation’s economy.


      During the period of lockdown from 22nd March 2020 to 24th May 2020, JNPT handled 610,405 TEUs and 913,233 MT of liquid and bulk cargo.


      Besides handling the regular operations, JNPT has also extended support to the EXIM clients and stakeholders in these challenging times. When the DPD customers were unable to take their deliveries owing to the acute shortage of Trucks, JNPT extended timely support to them by providing the ‘Extended Gate’ facility at ICD Mulund and ICD Tarapur; and shifting their containers there by rail without any additional shifting charges. From 13th April till date 25th May 2020, total 77 trains have facilitated the movement of an additional 5,538 TEUs of DPD containers by rail.


      JNPT also supported export clients based out in Hajira in the critical time when the exports were shut in the ports in their vicinity. Since April 2020 onwards, JNPT started rail movement of EXIM containers between JN Port and Dahej/Hazira, wherein 3909 TEUs of EXIM containers were moved by rail and thereafter from May 6, 2020 JN Port's own container terminal facilitated the commencement of moving empty containers by rail through CONCOR to ICD Dahej for Reliance Industries. These timely measures helped the exporters and strengthened JNPT’s hinterland connectivity.


      JNPT has always risen to the occasion, says Shri Sanjay Sethi, IAS, Chairman, JNPT. “India’s No. 1 Container Port has done it on a number of occasions for the last 31 years and it has always continued its support to nation’s economy by delivering its duties of an important part of the supply chain. By being fully operational during this lockdown when numerous industries have come to a complete standstill, JNPT continued its delivery of vital goods such as medical supplies, fuel and food in these difficult times. This time around, though, the personal risks for the workforce were significantly higher, still the support and commitment of employees of JNPT and stakeholders at a time of unprecedented crisis, is a tale of valour and hard work.


      The port has completed 31 years of operation and with some major projects and strategic initiatives underway; JNPT is expected to drive the next phase of transformation at the port, benchmarking its services against the best ports in the world to constantly evolve meeting the demands of the global market.
