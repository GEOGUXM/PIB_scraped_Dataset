    Mumbai: May 8, 2020


    There is a claim made in a viral video that passengers onboard the Air India flight from Chicago to Delhi were arguing as they had been charged thrice the fare. It is also claimed that these passengers were made to sit ignoring social distancing norms.


    The Ministry of Civil Aviation has said that this video is from an airline of a neighbouring country and not that of Air India as has been claimed.


    The fares to be charged under the ‘Vande Bharat Mission’ and the first week schedule of Air India rescue flights from South East Asia, West Asia, UK and USA have already been announced and the government will not be overcharging anyone.


    PIB Fact Check Unit undertakes verification of authenticity of news reports by referring them to concerned Ministries or Departments. It is an institutional arrangement made by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting for fighting the menace of fake news.
