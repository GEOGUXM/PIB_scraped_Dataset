      Taxpayers, beware of fake messages about fast track GST refund
      Posted On: 04 MAY 2020 5:51PM by PIB Mumbai


    The income-tax department and the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) have warned taxpayers not to succumb to the temptation of getting faster refunds by clicking on any fake links.


    It has been ascertained that the message reading “Dear Taxpayers, Due to Covid-19 outbreak, Central Government has started online processing of GST Refund. Click below to claim your refund http://Onlinefilingindia.in .”


    Tax payers are advised not click on the link as these are phishing messages not sent by CBIC or Infosys arm handling GST. The correct website to visit is www.gst.gov.in


    The income-tax department has also tweeted similarly, suggesting that they are not sending any mails for tax refunds and seeking personal information from taxpayers including their KYC details on mail.
