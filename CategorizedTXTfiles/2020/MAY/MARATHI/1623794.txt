    Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) has tied up with two NGOs to distribute food packets to migrant workers in Mumbai, Thane and Palghar. Through these NGOs - Dahisar (East) based Rajshree Sahu Manav Vikas Bahuudeshie Samajik Seva Sanstha and Adarsh Seksanik Evam Samajik Sanstha at Palghar, 2500 food packets have been distributed following the guidelines given by Ministry of Home Affairs.


    
    

    In the state of Maharashtra, KVIC has played a positive role in the country’s fight against COVID-19 by making over 10,850 face masks. 18 khadi institutes located in 18 districts of the state made these masks using cotton cloth and an agency under SFURTI scheme has handed over the masks to the District Collectors.


    The khadi institutions in the state also came forward to take care of artisans and their families. While one such institution has distributed grocery items (like wheat, rice, pulses, oil etc.) to 55 artisans, a SFURTI agency also has provided 300 raw food packets to the artisans. An amount of Rs 1000/- has been deposited in the bank accounts of 601 artisans. Three khadi institutions together contributed the total fund of 6 lakh and 1 thousand rupees for this purpose.


    Mumbai based women’s cooperative firm Shri Mahila Griha Udyog Lijjat Papad Ltd. has deposited a non-refundable amount totalling to Rs 18 crore 56 lakh and 66 thousand in the bank accounts of 24,231 artisans. The firm has also contributed Rs 50 lakh in PM Cares Fund and Rs 25 lakh in Chief Minister’s Relief Fund.
