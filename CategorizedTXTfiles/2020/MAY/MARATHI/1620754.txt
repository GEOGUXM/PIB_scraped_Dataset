    NAGPUR 03 May 2020


    Today was the last day of deployment of NCC volunteer cadets of Nagpur Group. Approximately 400 Boys and Girls have discharged their assigned duties at various PDS centers in Nagpur City and Rural areas. It was indeed a superlative experience for all participants to be part of the COVID-19 challenge. Group Captain M Kalim congratulated all Cadets, Associate NCC Officers, Permanent Instructors and Nodal Officers for the selfless service rendered to assist the Civil Administration. The support rendered by the District Distribution Officers, Zonal Supervisors and the District Collector and Magistrate of Nagpur has been exemplary. Above all, the NCC Group and its brave Cadets have realised its potential to support, assist and stand alongside Civil Administration in time of crisis or disaster. We have faith that together, we shall emerge victorious.
