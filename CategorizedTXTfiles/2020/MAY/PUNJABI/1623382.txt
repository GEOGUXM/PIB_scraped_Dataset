    The “Shramik Special” trains continue to provide relief to the stranded workers in the region. The states of Haryana and Punjab have been seeing the movement of these workers since these trains have started. Every necessary support has been provided by the railway authorities while facilitating their movement from the stations in these states.


    A joyful adieu is a common sight as these trains leave for their destinations. This was visible when a “Shramik Special” train, with 1334 migrant workers onboard, departed from Mohali in Punjab for Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh (UP). The same was observed when a train carrying migrants from Patiala in Punjab headed towards Supaul district in Bihar. The thermal scanning of the passengers and maintenance of social distancing among them are also being ensured by the railway authorities. Each migrant worker on Monday boarding a Shramik Special at the Chandigarh Railway Station, for Gorakhpur in UP, was provided a food packet and water bottles.

    Till 12th May, 2020 (09:30hrs), 542 “Shramik Special” trains have transported 6.48 lakh workers across the country. To facilitate the faster movement of the stranded workers, Government of India, in a recent letter to the state/UT Governments, has requested them to cooperate with Indian Railways to run more ‘Shramik Special’ trains.


    In addition to ‘Special Shramik’ trains, Ministry of Railways (MoR) in consultation with Ministry of Health & Family welfare (MoHFW) and Ministry of Home Affairs(MHA) has also decided that train services on Indian Railways shall be partially restored w.e.f. from 12th May 2020 in a graded manner. Accordingly, fifteen pairs of special trains have been announced by the Ministry of Railways.
