    Activities under MGNREGA ( Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) have begun in the regionafter the Government of India has announced certain relaxations in the COVID-19 related lockdown. MGNREGAprovides at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.


    Workers in the region, engaged under MGNREGA, are observing all the COVID-19 related precautions. Meena Devi, from Hamirpur district in Himachal Pradesh said due to lockdown allthe labourers were inside their homes. Now being engaged under MNREGAhelps her to earn livelihood adding that she and all her co-workers are practicing physical distancing as well as washing their hands regularly while working. Similarly, employment provided under MNREGA in village Sangla in Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh comes as big relief for the people.A similar case can be observed in Narnaul, Haryana where workers are also followingprecautions.
