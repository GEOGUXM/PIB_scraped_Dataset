    Economic packages announced under “Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan” has generated positivity among the stakeholders in the region. Covering different sectors and sections, the Finance Minister, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman announced five tranches of economic packages under the “Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan”. These announcements came after Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi on 12th May, 2020, gave a clarion call for “Aatma Nirbhar Bharat” to push the country towards self-reliance.


    As proposed in the recent announcements, a special scheme will be launched within a month to facilitate easy access to credit to Street vendors, who are amongst the most adversely impacted by the present situation for enabling them to restart their businesses. Under this scheme, bank credit facility for initial working capital up to Rs. 10,000 for each enterprise will be extended. This scheme will cover urban as well as rural vendors doing business in the adjoining urban areas. Use of digital payments and timely repayments will be incentivized through monetary rewards. It is expected that 50 lakh street vendors will be benefitted under this scheme and credit of Rs. 5,000 crore would flow to them. Kamlesh Kumar, a milk and curd vendor in Ludhiana expressed his keenness to take benefits announced for street vendors.

    To further enhance the ease of doing business, minimum threshold to initiate insolvency proceedings has been raised to Rs. 1 crore (from Rs. 1 lakh, which largely insulates MSMEs). According to Dr. S K Chaddha, an international strategic advisor, this is a big relief to trade industry and SMEs (small and medium enterprise) and it will save SME sector from unwanted litigations.
