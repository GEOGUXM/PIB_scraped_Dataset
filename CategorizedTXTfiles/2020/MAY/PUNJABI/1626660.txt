    To mitigate sufferings due to lockdown in the light of COVID-19, a large number of unemployed labourers have been given work under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in the region. With further relaxations in activities after the recent order of the Ministry of Home Affairs on 17th May 2020, works under the scheme will ensure the employment needs of labourers till the situation stabilizes. In Una, Himachal Pradesh, these works have come as a reprieve for labourers as they start working for ground water harvesting tank for community irrigation purposes.
