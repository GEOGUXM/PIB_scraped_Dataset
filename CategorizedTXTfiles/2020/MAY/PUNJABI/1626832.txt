    States of Punjab and Haryana contribute a major share in the procurement of wheat. As on 24.05.2020, Out of total of 341.56 Lakh Metric Tonnes (LMT) wheat procured by the government agencies, 125.84 LMT and 70.65 LMT were procured from Punjab and Haryana respectively. It is 0.12 LMT for Chandigarh and 0.03 LMT for Himachal Pradesh.


    To ensure that agricultural operations keep going, relaxations were provided for agricultural activities during the lockdown. Number of purchase centers were increased substantially to reduce the farmer footfalls in individual purchase centers to make procurement done in a safe manner during the pandemic. New centers were set up using every facility available at gram panchayat level and the numbers were increased sharply in the major procuring states like Punjab where it went up from 1836 to 3681 and 599 to 1800 in Haryana. Using technology, farmers were provided specific dates and slots to bring their produce which helped in avoiding overcrowding.


    Commission agent, Nachater Singh from Punjab said that the lifting of wheat by the government agencies has been very smooth and the entire payment for the same has been received from the government which has been further passed onto the farmers.
