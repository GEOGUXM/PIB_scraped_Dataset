    Government of India has asked states/UTs to cooperate with the railways in running more “Shramik Special” trains. This has been requested in a letter, by Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), to all state/UT Governments. This will facilitate movement of stranded migrant workers at a faster rate, states the letter. It has come after the cabinet secretary’s video conference on 10th May 2020 to review assistance provided by all States/ UTs Governments to the movement of migrant workers in buses and ‘Shramik’ special trains


    Since the Indian Railways started running “Shramik Special” trains across the country, the states of Haryana and Punjab in the region have been seeing the movement of stranded workers to their native states. Till 10th May, 2020, 40 such trains have departed from Ferozpur division and 11 from Ambala division. As these trains leave for its destination, a sense of relief and happiness is visible on faces of the migrant workers. This expression of joy was noticed today at Chandigarh station as the jubilant migrant workers left for Kishanganj. The railway authorities also ensure that the passengers are being thermally scanned before boarding the trains and social distancing is observed among them during travel.
