    Government provides free ration to non-ration card holders. Under Aatma Nirbhar Bharat package, Government of India has decided that food grains will be provided free of cost at the rate of 5 Kg per month for two months i.e. May and June 2020, to about 8 Crore migrant labour who are not covered under National Food Security Act (NFSA) or State scheme PDS cards. The total estimated cost of about Rs. 3500 Crore for implementation of this scheme will be fully borne by Government of India.


    A depot holder in Haryana, Santosh Kumar said that ration is being given to those who do not have ration cards. Further, he said that after the survey all the beneficiaries have been given tokens for distribution of ration to them. Gurjan from Haryana who does not have a ration card while thanking the government confirmed receiving ration. Mahender Kumar from Panchkula in Haryana said presently he does not have a ration card. He said that because of the lockdown they have been provided ration by the government. Ashok Kumar also from Panchkula said as he does not have a ration card, he received a token after the survey which helped him getting ration.

    In a recent video conference with media on 29th May, Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri Ram Vilas Paswan said that the identification of migrants/stranded migrants under Aatma Nirbhar Bharat scheme may be done by the State/UT Governments through own mechanisms and, Aadhar of persons, if available may also be leveraged to ascertain that person is not covered under NFSA or State PDS scheme. States/UTs may provide the benefit of this scheme to any poor/needy migrant/stranded migrant who does not have access to food and is not covered under NFSA/State PDS schemes.
