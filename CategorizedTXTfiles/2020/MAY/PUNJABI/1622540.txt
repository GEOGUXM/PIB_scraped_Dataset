    Thousands of migrant workers will get to reach their homes as they are being moved out of the states of Punjab and Haryana on “Shramik Special Trains”. The staff & officials are happy to help these stranded workers ensuring that each and every passenger is thermal scanned and social distancing is practiced among them. While eagerly waiting to board the train a sense of discipline can be observed in the passengers as can been seen at Bhiwani Station where passengers wearing masks wait for their turn to board the train to Katihar patiently while maintaining appropriate distance from each other.
