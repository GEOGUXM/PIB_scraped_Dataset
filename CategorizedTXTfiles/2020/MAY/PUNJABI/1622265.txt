    As “Shramik trains” facilitate the movement of migrant labourers in the region to reach their native places, Indian Railways has ensured that these migrant labourers don’t face any issue while complying with all the COVID-19 related precautions. The railway authorities have ensured that the travelling migrant workers and their families maintain adequate physical distancing norms, provided food packets for the journey and are being medically screened.

    A sense of happiness can be seen in these migrant labourers as they leave for their homes. A young child while sitting in a train said the Government has done good to send this train and he is happy to go his village in Hardoi in Uttar Pradesh. Another migrant worker said that he was waiting for this opportunity to leave for his home since lockdown was announced in the light of COVID-19.

    These trains are departing on regular basis from different stations in the states of Punjab and Haryana. A Shramik Train departed from Jalandhar on Thursday for Azamgarh in UP carrying 1300 migrant workers. Another 1200 migrant workers left the Patiala Railway Station in Punjab on Wednesday for their native place in Azamgarh in UP. The migrant workers while waiting for their turn to board the train to Katihar in Bihar maintained appropriate distancing from each other at Hisar station.

    These “Shramik Special” trains are being run by Indian Railways since 1st May as per the guidelines issued by Ministry of Home Affairs to move migrant workers, pilgrims, tourists, students and other persons stranded at different places due to lock down. These special trains will be run from point to point on the request of both the concerned State Governments as per the standard protocols for sending and receiving such stranded persons. The Railways and State Governments are required to appoint senior officials as Nodal Officers for coordination and smooth operation of these “Shramik Specials”.
