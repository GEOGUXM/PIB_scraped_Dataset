    A Special emphasis was given on reforms in agriculture marketing, management of marketable surplus, access of farmers to institutional credit and freeing agriculture sector of various restrictions with appropriate backing of statute. These were deliberated in a meeting held on 2 May, 2020 by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. The focus was on making strategic interventions in the existing marketing eco-system and bringing appropriate reforms in the context of rapid agricultural development. Farmers interests have always been one of concerns of the Union Government. The relaxations provided to farmers time to time after the announcement of lockdown in the light of COVID-19 and the consolidated revised guidelines which were issued on 15 April 2020 show this intent.
    As a part of the relief package under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, Paramjit Singh a farmer from Hoshiarpur district of Punjab said that he has received Rs 2000 in his bank account under the PM-KISAN and expressed his gratitude to the Government of India for the help. While from Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh, Ratan Chand confirmed receiving this amount.

    The retailers of fertilizers, pesticides and seeds have been allowed to remain open during the period of lockdown. While thanking the Government, Kripal Singh, a farmer from Punjab, said it has come as a big relief to the farmers and rates are reasonable. Another farmer, Sukhwinder Singh said that he is facing no problem in getting seeds and it was desirable in view of the upcoming sowing season.

    As harvesting season is on in the states of Punjab and Haryana, smooth functioning of machines is required to ensure timely delivery of the produce to the mandis by the farmers. Shops of agricultural machinery and its spare parts (including supply chain), repairs shops of combine & threshers units, welding shops etc have kept open.
