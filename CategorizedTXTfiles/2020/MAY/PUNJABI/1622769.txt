    As economic activities continue in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, no stone is left unturned in ensuring necessary precautions are being complied with. Managements of some industries, functional at this time under the relaxations, are taking all the COVID-19 related precautions as can be seen in a tyre manufacturing unit in Ludhiana. The employees are wearing masks and gloves while working on the machines maintaining appropriate distance. For employees to have enough awareness on COVID-19, posters also have been put inside the premises. Thermal scanning of the employees, disinfecting of buses, awareness materials can also be seen in another Ludhiana based yarns and garment manufacturing unit.

    Both the shop keepers as well as shoppers are happy as markets in Lower Bazaar of Shimla in Himachal Pradesh open up. As some shops have started to reopen, shopkeepers in Haryana have welcomed the much needed relief. Kundan, a shopkeeper from the state said that reopening of shops owing to the relaxations in Lockdown has come as a relief for everyone. Umesh Sikri of Kaithal is happy that some of the shops are going to reopen, however he is slightly wary as well, fearing that it might escalate the spread of the pandemic. He wished that people keep practicing social distancing.

    The activities under MGNREGA have also started securing the livelihood of people in rural areas. As these activities go on, the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package (PMGKP) came as a needed relief to the poor in the region. As part of the PMGKP, the Government has been providing free food grains and cash payment to women and poor senior citizens and farmers.
