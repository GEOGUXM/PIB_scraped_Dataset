Lakhs of starving people could manage their existence as ER shouldered the social responsibility of feeding the needy people during the lockdown period. Cooked food and other food items are distributed every day by Railway Protection force (RPF) and other staff among the needy people at different places over ER network. In Sealdah division alone, more than 1 lakh people were provided with food.
