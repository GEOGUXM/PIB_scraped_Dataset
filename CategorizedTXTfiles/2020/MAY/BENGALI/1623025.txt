    Though normal passenger train services are suspended at present due to nationwide lockdown, Goods Trains, Parcel Express trains, Shramik Special trains, Inspection Cars and some Special Trains are running through the Railway track continuously in Eastern Railway (ER) network.


    
    However, it is seen that some migrant workers and local inhabitants are trespassing through the Railway track.


    The Eastern Railway after noticing this has issued a strong advisory stating that it is really a punishable offence to walk or cross the railway track. The ER has also made it clear to them through this advisory that walking or crossing the railway track is too dangerous. Migrant workers and other people are hence requested to stay away from the railway track and not to use the same for walking.


    All the field staff of ER has been sensitised to maintain safety aspects and to resist trespassing the railway track also. Train drivers have also been instructed to maintain sharp look out for the trespassers, blow horn on observing any trespassing and take other necessary actions.
