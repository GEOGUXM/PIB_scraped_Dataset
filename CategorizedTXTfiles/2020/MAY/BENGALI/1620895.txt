    India Post has initiated a new delivery system called â€œPension on Wheels", to provide help to the elderly and the needy in this prevailing lockdown situation. The regular facility of disbursing pension and providing all other services is also available from the Post Office counters. The doorstep delivery of pension to those who are above 80 years of age or are sick will also continue. This was informed by Shri Niraj Kumar Post Master General of Kolkata Region.


    He said that as now social distancing is the need of the hour hence movements are restricted. In this situation providing essential services to the door steps of the citizens is utmost necessary. In order to help the elderly, especially those who are sick or bed-ridden, India Post is committed to arrange for home delivery of their pension.


    Those who receive pension through Post Office need intimate the nearest Post Office or office of the Postal Superintendent. The Postal Mail Van will come to nearby location where they can go and collect money.


    Even those who do not have Post Office accounts, who are in need of cash, they can, with the help of AADHAAR Enabled Payment System [AEPS], ask for cash which will be provided through Postal Van.
