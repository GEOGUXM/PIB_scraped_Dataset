    The ideology of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission of serving god in man has again been reflected when hundreds of monks known as Maharaj, out of sheer reverence to the common people, and their followers extended their services to aid families affected by the Super Cyclonic Storm Amphan which wreaked havoc on 20 May 2020.Ramakrishna Mission is trying to deliver their humane service to at least forty five thousand cyclone affected people in different districts.


    Tuhin Maharaj, looking after the relief operations undertaken in the cyclone ravaged areas, informed the Press Information Bureau that they are trying their best to reach to the cyclone affected people through their established network. Fifteen branches of the mission are taking part in the relief activities in the South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas, East Medinipur, Howrah and Kolkata districts. Where ever it is possible Mission is providing cooked food and where cooked food cannot be delivered they are distributing dry rations.


    Apart from providing foods to the needy people tarpaulins, medicines and temporary shelters are also being provided by them.


    Right from 1897, when Ramakrishna Mission was founded, it is conducting extensive relief operations for the victims of natural disasters such as cyclone, flood, earthquake and fire almost every year and man-made calamities such as riots.
