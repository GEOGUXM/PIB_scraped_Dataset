    In view of nationwide lockdown due to outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, uninterrupted supply of essential commodities across the country is a challenge for the Railways. South Eastern Railway (SER), as per the guidelines given by the Ministry of Railways, has already intensified its entire network for unabated movement of goods trains.


    SER, during the phase-wise lockdown, has already unloaded 2,26,829 tonnes of food grains, salt and fertilizers by hauling 99 rakes at different stations and sidings of its jurisdiction for serving the people of West Bengal, Odisha and Jharkhand. Out of this, 1,44,709 tonnes of rice by 66 rakes, 58,358 tonnes of wheat by 24 rakes, 13,250 tonnes of fertilizers by five rakes and 10,512 tonnes of salt by four rakes had been ferried and unloaded at different locations of SER viz. Midnapur, Kalaikunda, Kharagpur, Balasore, Rupsa, Bankura, Purulia, Adra, Bokaro Steel City, Chandil, Namkon, Tatisilwai etc. from April 1, to April 30, 2020.


    In addition, 465 trips of Parcel Express trains were run by this railway carrying essential commodities viz., fruits, vegetables, fishes, eggs, ginger, garlic, groceries, medicines, medical equipment including PPE Kits, masks, sanitizers etc. to different places in the country from April 2 to April 30, 2020.


    With the overwhelming responses and active participation of a dedicated workforce of frontline warriors of S. E. Railway viz., Loco Pilots, Guards, Trackmen, Station Masters, Parcel and Goods shed staff working at stations and divisional headquarters who are rendering their yeomanâ€™s services to the nation despite nationwide lockdown, this kind of task has been materialized. SER is committed to serve during any eventuality.
