    A news story published by the India Today stated that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is likely to speak on lockdown 5.0 after current lockdown ends on May 31 in this month’s Mann ki Baat programme. This is fake news.


    The spokesperson of the Ministry of Home Affairs has made it clear in a tweet that “All claims made therein are mere speculations by the reporter. To attribute them to MHA is incorrect and being irresponsible”.
