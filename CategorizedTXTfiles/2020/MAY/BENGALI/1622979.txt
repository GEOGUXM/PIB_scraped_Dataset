    Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW), which is running a 90 beds isolation ward with all facilities including oxygen availability in K G Hospital, has tested their new innovative remote controlled medical trolley to serve isolated patients in the hospital. The purpose of innovating such device is to create a space between the medical personnel, the frontline warriors, and the Covid-19 infected patients, to avoid infection and maintaining social distancing considering its transmissible nature.


    The trolley manufactured by the Electrical Department of the CLW under the able guidance of its General Manger Shri Praveen Kumar Mishra is equipped with sophisticated remote controlled devise and having facility of two way communication with remote camera. The medics attending the patients especially the staff nurses and attending doctors could monitor with this device sitting in their own place. It has a portable app ‘I Ball Guard’ application which allows the relatives of the patients to virtually meet their kin from a distance of 30 metres through mobiles. The trolley/cart can carry weight around 20 kgs of medicines, food, bed sheet etc thus maintaining social distancing between patients and medics.


    CLW has also started a well-equipped 150 beds quarantine facility at its Technical Training Center Hostel for the emergent patients. This center will facilitate the local residents to get a treatment in case of corona virus infection.
