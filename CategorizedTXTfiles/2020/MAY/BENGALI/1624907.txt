    In the second phase of the Vande Bharat Mission, the first flight for evacuating stranded Indian citizens at Bangladesh evacuated 169 passengers to Kolkata today. Ever since the lockdown was announced due to the outbreak of Corona pandemic, these citizens remain stranded at Bangladesh since there was a disruption of travel services between the two countries. The flight arrived at Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport, Kolkata at 12.18 pm (noon) local time.


    Among the 169 passengers, there were 73 students, 16 elderly persons, 45 stranded tourists, 16 cases of medical emergencies and a pregnant lady. The passengers were stuck up at Dhaka and in 18 districts of Bangladesh. After the medical check up all of them were quarantined.


    In the first phase of evacuation six flights of Air India and one flight of Biman Bangladesh evacuated over 950 stranded Indian nationals from Bangladesh. In the first phase that began on May 8, 2020, the flights were operated to Srinagar, Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai.
