    CSIR-CMERI, Durgapur, has developed the Contactless Soap cum Water Dispensing Unit to tackle the challenges posed by COVID-19. The Contactless design is based upon usage of Proximity Sensors which activates itself on proximity of objects. Important features of this unit are: Dispensing of both Liquid Soaps and Water from the same outlet and Time gap of 20 seconds between dispensing of Soap and Water. Water usage Tank Capacity is 250ml (extendable to 1 litre)


    In this regard, Prof. (Dr.) Harish Hirani, Director, CSIR-CMERI, Durgapur, stated that, “owing to multiple contacts throughout the day, our hands are the most vulnerable and potent carriers of any germs and especially COVID 19. Even while washing hands one should follow the WHO guidelines for rubbing and proper washing of hands to ensure comprehensive disinfection of hands. The 20 second timer is a game-changer, as it ensures that the user is compelled to rub his/her hands for the requisite time span as per Standard Hygiene guidelines. Our Technology is evolved based upon intensive research and ergonomic demands”


    CSIR-CMERI has also developed contiguous products such as Soaps and Hand Sanitizers. Both the products have been developed with strict adherence to WHO guidelines for Soaps and Sanitizers. One unit Portable Touch free Soap-cum-Water Dispensing System & 50 bottles of hand sanitizers was handed over to the Chief Terminal Manager, IOCL, Rajbandh, Paschim Buedwan, West Bengal.
