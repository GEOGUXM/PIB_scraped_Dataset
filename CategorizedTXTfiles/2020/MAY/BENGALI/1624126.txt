The viewers, after logging on to www.bitm.gov.in on May 18, 2020 at 7 am in the morning, will be guided through various experiments they can experience on their breakfast table and in the kitchen. They can interact with the presenter over mobile also. The number is, 9433244145.


    The second event for students, up to class XII, is ‘Exhibit Hunt’ competition from 8:00 am onwards. The participants will have to visit www.bitm.gov.in for viewing six videos of exhibits and answer few relevant questions. Digital certificates will be awarded to those who answer correctly.


    The objective of International Museum Day (IMD) is to raise awareness about the fact that, “Museums are an important means of cultural exchange, enrichment of cultures and development of mutual understanding, cooperation and peace among peoples.” Organised on May 18 each year or around this date, the events and activities planned to celebrate International Museum Day can last a day, a weekend or an entire week. IMD was celebrated for the first time 40 years ago. All around the world, more and more museums participate in International Museum Day. Last year, more than 37,000 museums participated in the event in about 158 countries and territories.
