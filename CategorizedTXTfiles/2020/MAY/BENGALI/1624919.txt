    Howrah Bridge, one of the busiest cantilever bridges in the world has been adorned by a dynamic architectural illumination with synchronised light and sound show with pre-programmed digital light control algorithms utilising advanced technologies and the latest energy-efficient LED lights. The initiative has been taken to pay tribute to all the COVID warriors who are combating with this deadly menace to save the country as well as its people.


    The brilliant son-at-lumiere transforms to an arrangement that illustrates the Pacha Bhuta (the five elements) which is the source of creation. And here, the light signifies the miracle of life in the time of darkness, which India is now experiencing with the entire world in the wake of outbreak of the Corona pandemic. India is showing the path in controlling Corona-a kind of light amidst sea of darkness. The entire nation has stood up to win the battle.


    According to Shri Vinit kumar, Chairman, Kolkata Port Trust, Rabindra Setu stands illuminated today in association with ‘Signify’, the new company name of Philips Lighting to pay tribute to all the COVID warriors who are constantly fighting against the disease to keep the citizens of the country safe from it. The Kolkata Port Trust-the custodian of the bridge is spreading this message through the medium of light.
