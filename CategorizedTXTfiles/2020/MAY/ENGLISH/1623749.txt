Raising of investment limit in this sector to Rs 100 crore will give great boost to the industry, which will now get easy finance from banks. The sector was demanding this revision for long, he said. The Fund of Funds, which has a corpus of Rs 10 thousand crore, will benefit over 25 lakh MSMEs under stress. Similarly, easing of global tendering norm is a remarkable step, he said.
