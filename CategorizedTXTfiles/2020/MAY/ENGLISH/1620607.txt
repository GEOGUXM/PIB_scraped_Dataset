    Through a graded, pre-emptive and pro-active approach, Government of India is taking several steps along with the States/UTs for prevention, containment and management of COVID-19. These are being regularly reviewed and monitored at the highest level.


    The Union Minister for Health & Family Welfare, Dr. Harsh Vardhan today visited Lady Hardinge Medical College to review status of COVID-19 management. During the visit the Union Minister visited the Director’s office, emergency, OPD, sampling center, COVID block- critical areas on ground and first floor, Red zone area and changing facility for doctors & health workers.


    Dr Harsh Vardhan was satisfied to notice that the doctors and health staff manning the facility were provided special bathing, changing and spray facility for disinfecting themselves at Oncology building, the specialized COVID-19 facility. He lauded the hospital administration’s efforts of regularly talking to its front line health personnel twice a day to deal with the situation effectively.


    Dr Harsh Vardhan urged the people of India to observe the extended period of lockdown 3.0 (till May 17, 2020) in letter and spirit and treat it as an effective intervention to cut down the chain of transmission of COVID-19. He urged the countrymen not to ostracize the doctors treating COVID-19 patients and to not stigmatize the patients who have won the battle against COVID-19.


    So far, a total of 10,632 people have been cured. In the last 24 hours, 682 patients were found cured. This takes our total recovery rate to 26.59%. The total number of confirmed cases is now 39,980. Since yesterday, an increase of 2644 has been noted in the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in India.
