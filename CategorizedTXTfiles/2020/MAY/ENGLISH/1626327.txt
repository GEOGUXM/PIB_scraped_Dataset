    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall have been given below:


    1.1 Crude oil production by ONGC in nomination block during April, 2020 was 1681.77 TMT which is 0.65% lower than the monthly target and 0.53% lower when compared with actual production in April, 2019. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

          + Closure of wells in Western Offshore due to less offtake by M/s GAIL due to Covid-19 Lockdown.
          + Restriction of movements for field operations in Onshore fields due to Covid-19 lockdown.

    1.2 Crude oil production by OIL in the nomination block during April, 2020 was 248.25 TMT which is 0.9% lower than monthly target and 6.39% lower when compared with actual production in April, 2019. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


          + Less than planned contribution from workover wells and drilling wells.

          + Rise in water cut and decline in liquid production from existing wells.
          + Loss of production due to nationwide lockdown for COVID-19 Pandemic.

    1.3 Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs in the PSC regime during April, 2020 was 615.80 TMT which is 3.73% lower than the monthly target and 19.25% lower when compared with actual production in April, 2019. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


          + RJ-ON-90/1- Mangala: Delay in hook-up of new wells, ESP failure, delay in workover wells revival and new injector due to COVID 19 impact. (CEIL)

          + RJ-ON-90/1- Bhagyam: Artificial lifts (PCP) malfunction & delayed start-up of full field polymer injection. (CEIL)
          + RJ-ON-90/1- Aishwarya: Delay in Lower Fatehgarh polymer FDP completion. ESP, Jet Pump failure in few wells. (CEIL)
          + RJ-ON-90/1- ABH: Delay in setting up permanent processing facility and COVID 19 also caused delay in hook-up of Pad-8 and Pad-3 planned in March end. (CEIL)
          + RJ-ON-90/1- Satellite Fields: Failure or flow cease in few wells. (CEIL)
          + AAP-ON-94/1: Low consumer demand- Covid -19 lockdown. (HOEC)
          + CB-ONN-2003/1: Less offtake due to COVID-19 lockdown. (SUN)

      * Loss of potential in Deohal area due to presence of CO 2 in production stream.

      * Less gas off take by consumers due to Covid-19 lockdown.

    2.3 Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs in PSC regime during April, 2020 was 233.59 MMSCM which is 1.03% lower than the monthly target and 40.67% lower when compared with actual production in April, 2019. The shortfall in gas production is primarily due to less gas off take by consumers due to Covid-19 lockdown.

    Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production


    3.1 CPSE Refineries’ production during April, 2020 was 7103.76 TMT which is 28.91% lower than the target for the month and 36.93% lower than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:

             1. IOCL, Guwahati: BS VI shutdown deferment.
             2. IOCL-Barauni, Gujarat, Haldia, Matura, Panipat and Paradip: Lower due to low demand due to COVID-19 lockdown.
             3. IOCL-Bongaigaon: Deferment of plan shutdown.
             4. BPCL, Mumbai & Kochi: Lower due to low demand and COVID-19 lockdown.
             5. HPCL, Mumbai & Visakh: Lower due to impact of COVID-19 lockdown.
             6. CPCL, Manali: Lower due to low demand due to COVID-19 lockdown.

    3.2 Production in JV refineries during April, 2020 were 925.13 TMT which is 22.71% lower than the target for the month and 46.26% lower than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production mainly include low demand due to COVID-19 lockdown.


    3.3 Production in private refineries during April, 2020 was 6716.28 TMT which is lower than the target for the month and when compared with April, 2019 by 12.98% and 12.98 % respectively.


    3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of April, 2020 vis-à-vis April, 2019 are given at Annexures-IV and V respectively.
