    Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), on 11.05.2020, wrote to all States/UTs to facilitate faster movement of stranded migrant workers to their native places, through buses and 'Shramik' special trains being run by the Government specifically for this purpose.


    The communication highlighted the situation wherein migrant workers are walking on the roads and on railway tracks. All States/UTs were advised that in case they are found in such condition, they should be appropriately counselled, taken to nearby shelters and provided with food, water, etc. till they are facilitated to board the 'Shramik' special trains or buses to their native places.


    However, instances of migrant workers walking on roads, railway tracks and travelling in trucks are still being reported from different parts of the country. In view of this, MHA has again written to all States/UTs to ensure that these migrant workers do not have to walk back home.


    The communication states that Ministry of Railways is running more than 100 'Shramik' special trains per day and is ready to arrange additional trains, as per requirement. People need to be made aware about these arrangements and counselled by State/UT governments to not travel on foot, when they can travel in buses/trains being specially run by the government to facilitate their journey.
