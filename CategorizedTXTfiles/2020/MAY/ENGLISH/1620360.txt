      Posted On: 02 MAY 2020 3:20PM by PIB Delhi


    After a comprehensive review of the Lockdown measures to contain the COVID-19 situation in the country, Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), issued an Order yesterday, to further extend the Lockdown for a further period of two weeks w.e.f. May 4, 2020.


    In order to remove confusion regarding movement of persons and vehicles in orange zones ( please refer the concerned paragraph on permitted activities in Orange Zones given in https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1620095 ) , this clarification has been issued, as below:


    In the Orange Zones, in addition to the activities prohibited throughout the country, inter-district and intra-district plying of buses remains prohibited.


    Two other activities have been allowed with restrictions:

      * Taxis and cab aggregators are permitted, with one driver and two passengers only.
      * Inter-district movement of individuals and vehicles is allowed, only for permitted activities, with maximum two passengers, besides the driver, in four wheeler vehicles.

    All other activities are allowed in the Orange Zones, without any restrictions.


    However, States/UTs based on their assessment and priorities, may choose to permit a lesser number of activities.
