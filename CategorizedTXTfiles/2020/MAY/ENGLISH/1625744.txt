    Through a graded, pre-emptive and pro-active approach, Government of India is taking several steps along with the States/UTs for prevention, containment and management of COVID-19. These are being regularly reviewed and monitored at the highest level.


    A total of 45,299 patients are cured of COVID-19. A total of 3,002 COVID-19 patients are reported cured since last 24 hours. The recovery rate is improving continuously and is 40.32% presently.


    India currently has 63,624 active cases. These are all under active medical supervision. Of the active cases, only approx. 2.94% of the cases are in ICU.


    The case mortality rate in India is 3.06%, which is much lesser in comparison to the global case mortality rate of 6.65%. This brings into focus our efforts towards timely case identification and proper clinical management of the cases.


    An analysis of the deaths indicates 64% deaths in males & 36% in females. In terms of age distribution, it is observed that 0.5% deaths are reported in less than 15 years age group, 2.5% in 15-30 years age group, 11.4% in 30-45 years age group, 35.1% in 45-60 years age group and 50.5% in people above 60 years. Further, 73% of the death cases had underlying co-morbidities. Elderly people (above 60 years of age) and people having co-morbidities are identified as high risk groups for COVID-19.


    It is advised that community awareness on COVID appropriate behaviour is an important intervention for prevention for spread of this disease. There is need to focus on personal hygiene, hand hygiene, and respiratory etiquettes and environmental sanitation. Face covers and masks should be used in public places and physical distancing should be followed. Large gatherings should be avoided. Individuals in high risk groups should stay at home except for essential and health purposes.
