    It has been decided that the travel restrictions imposed by Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) would continue to remain in place till prohibition on international air travel of passengers to/from India is lifted by the Government of India. Thus, all incoming passenger traffic into India through any of the 107 immigration check posts would remain suspended till prohibition on international air travel of passengers to or from India is lifted.


    However, no such travel restrictions would apply to any aircraft, ship, train or any other vehicle deployed for bringing back Indian nationals stranded abroad. Similarly, no such travel restrictions would apply to persons allowed to travel from India to other countries, as permitted by MHA.


    Secondly, these travel restrictions also do not apply to any movement of cargo or goods and supplies in any vehicle, aircraft, ship, train etc. and to their crew, sailor, driver, helper cleaner etc. However, they would be subject to thorough medical screening for COVID-19, as per the extant guidelines of Ministry of Health & Family Welfare.
