    Annual Rate of Inflation(y-o-y in %) based on WPI (2011-12)


    The price indices of Primary Articles have been computed based on mandi prices of agricultural items reported from Directorate of Economics & Statistics, M/o Agriculture; ex-mine prices of minerals reported from Indian Bureau of Mines; prices of crude petroleum & natural gas reported from Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and selected PSUs. Price indices of Fuel & Power major group have been computed based on the price data reported from Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, selected PSUs, Office of the Coal Controller and Central Electricity Authority. Price indices of these major groups (Primary Articles and Fuel & Power) were released for April 2020 with standard procedures. No changes in estimation procedures were done.


    In view of the preventive measures and announcement of nation-wide lockdown by the Government to contain spread of COVID-19 pandemic, the price collection of Manufactured Products through personal visits of price collectors was suspended with effect from 19 th March, 2020. The data (ex-factory prices) was collected through electronic means of communications from selected factories and institutional sources. The Price Movement of these Sub-groups/Groups of WPI was worked out by taking the prices of only those items for which at least 25% of price quotations were reported from the selected manufacturing units. Out of the 22 NIC two-digit groups for Manufactured products, based up the above criterion, indices were compiled only for 5 manufacturing groups i.e, manufacture of food products, manufacture of beverages, manufacture of chemicals and chemical products, manufacture of pharmaceuticals, medicinal chemical and botanical products, and manufacture of Basic Metals.

    Note:


    1- Index for Mf/o Food Products is computed excluding sub-groups viz. ‘Processing and preserving of meat’ and ‘Manufacture of processed ready to eat food’. The weights of these subgroups are distributed among other subgroups on pro rata basis.


    2- Index for Mf/o Chemicals and Chemical Products is compiled excluding the subgroups manufacture of man-made fibres’ and ‘manufacture of paints, varnishes and similar coatings, printing ink and mastics’. The weights of these subgroups are distributed among other subgroups on pro rata basis


    3. Index for Mf/o Basic Metals is computed excluding subgroup Forgings of steel. The weights of this subgroup is distributed among other subgroups on pro rata basis.
