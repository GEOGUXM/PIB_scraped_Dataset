    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, in his message on the eve of Buddha Purnima has said: -


    “On the auspicious occasion of Buddha Purnima, I extend my greetings and best wishes to all my fellow citizens and followers of Lord Buddha all over the world.


    The message of Lord Buddha inspires us to serve humanity with love, truth, compassion and by way of non-violence. His life and ideals reinforce our belief in the eternal values like equality, harmony and justice.


    At a time, when we are facing an unprecedented crisis in the form of COVID-19, we should come forward to help those in need and thereby follow the path shown by Lord Buddha. May this pious festival inspire us to follow the teachings of Lord Buddha and strengthen the spirit of harmony amongst us”.
