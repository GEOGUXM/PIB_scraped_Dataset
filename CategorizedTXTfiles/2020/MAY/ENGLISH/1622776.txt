    Indian Navy as part of Operation Samudra Setu under the Vande Bharat Mission has deployed INS Magar for second phase of repatriation of Indian citizens from Maldives. In the first phase, INS Jalashwa had evacuated a total of 698 Indian nationals stranded in the Maldives on 10 May 20.


    Even as heavy rains at Male made conditions difficult, the ship made arrangements to ensure safety of people. A total of 202 personnel have embarked the ship, which includes 24 women, two expectant mothers and two children. One of the men, who hails from Tamil Nadu, has a fractured leg.


    In line with the procedure followed on 08 May, the evacuees were screened medically, their baggage disinfected and were allotted IDs as per various zones earmarked on board the ship.
