    BSCL has effectively leveraged the power of Radio and FM Channel to reach out to the population and ensure that the right messages are disseminated. The CEO of BSCL has been leading this effort and speaking to the citizens through FM Channel regarding how to fight with COVID 19. In addition, continuous outreach using voice message through FM Channel, e-Rikshaw and social media campaign through, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, have helped city administration keep things in control and avoid panic among citizens.


    “ Lockdown Ke Panney ” is another such innovative IEC initiative taken by the BSCL and its dynamic leadership.

BSCL supported with creation and running of 4 food distribution centers across identified area in Municipal Corporation Bhagalpur. Further, to support the homeless population in the city, the Municipal Corporation Bhagalpur established 10 shelters , and provided food and lodging to the homeless population free of cost.
