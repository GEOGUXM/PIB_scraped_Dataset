    National School of Drama of Ministry of Culture has planned daily webinars for a week from 10th May 2020 onwards by theatre veterans in the time of national lockdown due to COVID19. Interested people can join these webinars on NSD’s Youtube channel and Facebook page. The one hour webinar every day will start at 4 pm and people will get extra 30 minutes for question answer. The webinars will not only focus on theatre history and criticism but also on hands-on training through the digital medium.


    A carefully collated series of lectures, lec-dem, master class, interaction with legendary personalities from the field of theatre and other arts and in depth conversation with maestros of Indian theatre will be included. It will not only satiate the hunger for learning of millions at this moment of limited and mediated interaction but also will be a resource material for research and learning.

    The webinar also will be live at NSD's official Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/nsdnewdelhi/


    National School of Drama has planned this initiative to reach out to people in every nook & corner of the country who are bound by the peripheries of their domestic arena and are not in physical contact with the regular theatre practice. This course not only aims at theatre practitioner but for all the people who need human and artistic interaction for widening their horizon of experience. In other words: FOR ALL.


    Speaking on the plan to initiate the webinar, Director In charge of National School of Drama Prof. Suresh Sharma Said, “Due to this ongoing pandemic we feel that the artists are feeling very abandoned as they are not getting the chance to perform. Since we all know the act of theatre is all about working together in a group, but due to ongoing situation this has become impossible. National School of Drama has initiated an online platform where the people who are sitting at home can connect with us and utilize their time to grab the knowledge. This not only will help to enhance their skills but will also be helpful to release some mental tension created by this pandemic.”


    Along with trying out new avenues, there were also concerns about the well being of our artist community. The transformation from being in a buzzing environment to being confined to homes for and uncertain amount of time raised worries among the students and other theatre enthusiasts. The online training program will help to combat the situation.
