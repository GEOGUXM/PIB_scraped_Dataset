    According to the latestrelease (at 1640 Hrs. IST) by the National Weather Forecasting Centre/Cyclone Warning Divisionof the India Meteorological Department:


    The Super Cyclonic Storm ‘AMPHAN’ (pronounced as UM-PUN ) over Northwest Bay of Bengal moved north-northeastwards with a speed of 20 kmph during past 06 hours and lay centred at 1430 hrs IST of today, the 20 th May, 2020 as an Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm over Northwest Bay of Bengal near latitude 21.4°N and longitude 88.1°E, about 190 km east-northeast of Paradip (Odisha), 65 km east-southeast of Digha (West Bengal), 35 km nearly south of Sagar Islands and 225 km south-southwest of Khepupara (Bangladesh).

    
                Landfall process has commenced and the forward sector of the wall cloud region is entering into land in West Bengal. During next 2-3 hours it is very likely cross West Bengal – Bangladesh coasts between Digha (West Bengal) and Hatiya Islands (Bangladesh) close to Sundarbans with maximum sustained wind speed of 155-165 kmph gusting to 185 kmph. After landfall,the system is likely to move north-northeastwards close to Kolkata.

    Kolkata (Alipur) reported 105 kmph winds at 1430 hrs IST of today, the 20 th May 2020.


    The system is now being continuously tracked by the Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) at Kolkata (West Bengal).


    Forecast track and intensity are given in the following table:
