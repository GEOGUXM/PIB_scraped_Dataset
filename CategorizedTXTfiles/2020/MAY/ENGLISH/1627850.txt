    According to the National Weather Forecasting Centre/Cyclone Warning Divisionof the India Meteorological Department:


    (1) The depression over south coastal Oman and adjoining Yemenremained practically stationary during past 06 hours and lay centred at 0830 hrs IST of today, the 30 th May, 2020 near latitude 17.3°N and longitude 54.2°E, about 30 km north-northeast of Salalah (Oman) and 240 km east-northeast of Al Ghaydah (Yemen). It is very likely to intensify further into a deep depression during next 12 hours. It is very likely to move slowly west-northwestwards during next 12 hours and west-southwestwards thereafter.


    Forecast track and intensity are given in the following table:

    (2) Another low pressure area is very likely to form over southeast & adjoining eastcentralArabian Seaduring next 48 hours. It is very likely to move north-northwestwards and concentrate into a depression over eastcentral and adjoining southeast Arabian Sea during subsequent 48 hours.


    Warnings:


    (i) Rainfall:

      * No adverse weather is likely over the Indian land areas, with the first system, as it is located over south coastal Oman and is expected to move over Oman and Yemen during next 48 hours and dissipate there.

    (ii) Wind warning


    Squally wind speed reaching 45-55 kmph gusting to 65 kmph very likely to prevail over westcentral Arabian Sea along & off South Oman – Yemen coasts during next 48 hours.


    (iii) Sea condition


    The sea condition is very likely to be rough to very rough over westcentral Arabian Sea along & off South Oman – Yemen coasts during next 48 hours.


    (iv) Fishermen Warning

      * The fishermen are advised not to venture into over westcentral Arabian Sea along & off South Oman – Yemen coasts during next 48 hours.
      * In view of the likely development of the second low pressure system over southeast & adjoining east-central Arabian Sea, Fishermen are advised not to venture into southeast and adjoining east-central Arabian Sea from 31 st May, until further advisories.
