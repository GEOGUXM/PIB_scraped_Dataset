    In order to ensure faster resolution of the complaints/issues of the drivers / transporters on passage of goods carriers including empty trucks for inter state movement across the country during Locddown, Union Government has decided to utilise the Control Room of Ministry of Home Affairs where officers of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) are also being deputed for this purpose.


    The Control Room Number for the Lockdown of the MHA i.e. 1930 is being made availble for the benefit of Drivers / Transporters to lodge any complaint pertaining to the Lockdown. In addition NHAI helpline number 1033 is also available for National Highway related grievances. MORTH, NHAI, Transport Departments of the States / UTs, Transport Associations will take necessary steps to provide information to the Drivers / Transporters. The officials deputed from MORTH in the MHA control room will assist in complaint/ grievance resolution relating to the Transport sector / Drivers. The MoRTH officials would also compile the daily report on such complaints received


    It may stated that movement during the lockdown is governed by the orders and guidelines of the MHA.


    It provides for redressal of complaints by drivers and transporters on passage of goods carriers incuding empty trucks and inter state movement of the driver / cleaner from their residence to and fro to the truck parking area.


    This mechanism is expected to greatly address the issues of hurdles in the movement of goods across States/UTs during the lockdown announced to curb COVID-19 pandemic in India.
