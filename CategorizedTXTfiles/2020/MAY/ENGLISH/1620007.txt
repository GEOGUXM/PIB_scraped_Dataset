    The 12th session of Ministry of Tourism’s Dekho ApnaDesh on 30th April 2020, titled, ‘Celebrating the Incredible Indian Women in Responsible Tourism’ presented some powerful and personal stories of a few incredible women in India, who offer an alternative imagination of travel.


    The webinar explained how individuals can create change in their life and the communities they live in through tourism. While travelling , using local resources , staying in home stays, supporting undocumented new lesser know enterprises eating at a small family owned restaurant, all make a huge difference to the locals and thus helps in growing the areas which benefit from tourism.


    The team of presenters from Outlook Responsible Tourism Initiative, a part of the Outlook Publishing Group, Soity Banerjee, Radhika P Nair, and SonaliChatterjee


    made a case when in the post-Covid world, the role of these women in tourism will be crucial, especially when homestays and remote destinations will start drawing more travellers.
