    3. Therefore, TDS on the amount paid or credited during the period from 14 th May, 2020 to 31 st March, 2021 shall be deducted at the reduced rates specified in the table in para 1 above. Similarly, the tax on the amount received or debited during the period from 14 th May, 2020 to 31 st March, 2021 shall be collected at the reduced rates specified in the table in para 2 above.


    4. It is further stated that there shall be no reduction in rates of TDS or TCS, where the tax is required to be deducted or collected at higher rate due to non-furnishing of PAN/Aadhaar . For example, if the tax is required to be deducted at 20% under section 206AA of the Income-tax Act due to non-furnishing of PAN/Aadhaar, it shall be deducted at the rate of 20% and not at the rate of 15%.


    5. Legislative amendments in this regard shall be proposed in due course.
