      Fact Check team of PIB Guwahati busts fake news

    A tweet has been circulated in the Social Media today by a web portal named Guwahati plus that the Ministry of Home Affairs has declared Guwahati as a Red Zone. It further stated in the tweet that the State government has not issued an official statement yet.


    Likewise one local news channel, News Live also broadcast the news that 7 districts of Assam are declared Red Zone including Kamrup Metro, Cachar and Bongaigaon. As a matter of fact Ministry of Home Affairs does not declare a district or state as Red Zone. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare decides the list of Red Zone, Orange Zone and Green Zone districts and share the information with State/UTs on a weekly basis or earlier as required. State/UTs on review may consider inclusion of additional districts as Red Zone and Orange Zone districts depending on the extent of spread of COVID-19 infection. Currently the list issued on 30.04.2020 by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has named only 3 districts namely Dhubri, Morigaon and Goalpara under Orange Zone and none under Red Zone.


    All concerned are requested to refrain from spreading such false information.
