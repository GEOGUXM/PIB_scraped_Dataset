      Posted On: 17 SEP 2020 2:54PM by PIB Chennai


    Chennai Port reviewed the issues related to movement of export containers to Chennai Port Trust along with Terminal operators on 14.09.2020.


    It was observed that the container movement to the port was not uniform on all days. It was seen that on certain days, there is huge rush of export trailers to the port and on certain other days, the movement was in trickles only.


    In order to address the above, it has been decided to allow 7 days carrying, time instead of the present five days by the two terminal operators viz., DP World and PSA Singapore on a trial basis from 16.09.2020 to 15.10.2020.


    The above measure is expected to facilitate more time for exporters who can move the trailers in advance to avoid the peak hours rush.


    Chairman, Chennai Port requested the other stakeholders, viz., vessel operators, custom brokers and exporters community to work round the clock like the Port, custom and Terminal operators so that congestion during peak hours can be avoided, according to a press release issued by the Secretary , Chennai Port Trust.
