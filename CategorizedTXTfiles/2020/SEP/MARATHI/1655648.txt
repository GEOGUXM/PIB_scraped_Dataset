    Even though India became Independent on August 15, 1947, the people of old Hyderabad state, now divided into Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana , had to wait for another 13 months and two days to get freedom from the Nizam's rule. Finally, it was on September 17, 1948 that Marathwada was integrated with India following the success of ‘Operation Polo’.


    A number of people had sacrificed their lives in the struggle for freedom and many leaders from Marathwada were in the forefront of the struggle. Swami Ramanand Teerth, Govindbhai Shroff, Vijayendra Kabra, P H Patwardhan were prominent among the leaders.


    The Marathwada Freedom Fighters’ Memorial is in Parbhani.
