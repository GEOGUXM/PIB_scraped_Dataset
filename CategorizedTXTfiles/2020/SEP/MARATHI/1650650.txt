    The Government has announced a new comprehensive Civil Services reforms programme aimed at better services delivery to the public.


    The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi today approved the new National Architecture for Civil Services Capacity Building called “Mission Karmayogi” that aims to transform the capacity building apparatus at individual, institutional and process levels at Government of India.


    The fundamental focus of the reform is the creation of a ‘citizen centric civil service’ capable of creating and delivering services conducive to economic growth and public welfare. Accordingly, Mission Karmayogi shifts the focus from “Rule based training to Role based training”. Greater thrust has been laid on behavioural change.


    The National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building has been so designed that it remains entrenched i n Indian Culture and sensibilities while drawing learning resources from the best institutions and practices from across the world. The Programme will be delivered by setting up an Integrated Government Online Training- iGOT Karmayogi Platform .


    A Public Human Resources Council under the chairmanship of Prime Minister, with Union Ministers, Chief Ministers, eminent HR practitioners, national and international experts would oversee the entire capacity building exercise.
    An expert body called Capacity Building Commission will be set up to harmonize training standards, create shared faculty and resources, and have supervisory role over all Central Training Institutions.


    A Special Purpose Vehicle, SPV will be set up as Section 8 – Not for Profit Company which will own and manage the iGOT-Karmayogi platform. The SPV will own all Intellectual Property Rights on behalf of the Government of India.


    An appropriate monitoring and evaluation framework will also be put in place for performance evaluation of all users of the iGOT-Karmayogi platform so as to generate a dashboard view of Key Performance Indicators.


    The iGOT model was tried successfully during Covid situation for training health professionals. More than 12.73 lakh health workers completed 17.66 lakh courses of varied durations within a span of 3 months.


    iGOT-Karmayogi platform is expected to evolve into a vibrant and world-class market place for content where carefully curated and vetted digital e-learning material will be made available. Besides capacity building, service matters like confirmation after probation period, deployment, work assignment and notification of vacancies etc. would eventually be integrated with the proposed competency framework.


    To cover around 46 lakh Central employees, a sum of Rs.510.86 crore will be spent over a period of 5 years from 2020-21 to 2024-25. Mission Karmayogi aims to prepare the Indian Civil Servant for the future by making him more creative, constructive and citizen friendly.

The Programme will be delivered by setting up an Integrated Government Online Training-iGOT Karmayogi Platform. The core guiding principles of the Programme will be

     2. To emphasize on 'on-site learning' to complement the ‘off-site’ learning,
     3. To create an ecosystem of shared training infrastructure including that of learning materials, institutions and personnel,
     4. To calibrate all Civil Service positions to a Framework of Roles, Activities and Competencies (FRACs) approach and to create and deliver learning content relevant to the identified FRACs in every Government entity,
     5. To make available to all civil servants, an opportunity to continuously build and strengthen their Behavioral, Functional and Domain Competencies in their self-driven and mandated learning paths.
     6. To enable all the Central Ministries and Departments and their Organizations to directly invest their resources towards co-creation and sharing the collaborative and common ecosystem of learning through an annual financial subscription for every employee,
     7. To encourage and partner with the best-in-class learning content creators including public training institutions, universities, start-tips and individual experts,
     8. To undertake data analytics in respect of data emit provided by iGOT-
        Karmayogi pertaining to various aspects of capacity building, content
        creation, user feedback and mapping of competencies and identify
        areas for policy reforms.

    Objectives


    It is also proposed to set up a Capacity Building Commission, with a view to ensure a uniform approach in managing and regulating the capacity building ecosystem on collaborative and co-sharing basis.


    The role of Commission will be as under-

      * To assist the PM Public Human Resources Council in approving the Annual Capacity Building Plans.
      * To exercise functional supervision over all Central Training Institutions dealing with civil services capacity building.
      * To create shared learning resources, including internal and external faculty and resource centers.
      * To coordinate and supervise the implementation of the Capacity Building Plans with the stakeholder Departments.

      * To set norms for common mid-career training programs across all civil services.
      * To suggest policy interventions required in the areas of HR Management and Capacity Building to the Government.

    iGOT-Karmayogi platform brings the scale and state-of-the-art infrastructure to augment the capacities of over two crore officials in India. The platform is expected to evolve into a vibrant and world-class market place for content where carefully curated and vetted digital e-learning material will be made available. Besides capacity building, service matters like confirmation after probation period, deployment, work assignment and notification of vacancies etc. would eventually be integrated with the proposed competency framework.


    Mission Karmayogi aims to prepare the Indian Civil Servant for the future by making him more creative, constructive, imaginative, innovative, proactive, professional, progressive, energetic, enabling, transparent and technology-enabled. Empowered with specific role-competencies, the civil servant will be able to ensure efficient service delivery of the highest quality standards.

The expenditure is partly funded by multilateral assistance to the tune of USD 50 million. A wholly owned Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for NPCSCB will be set up under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013. The SPV will be a "not-for-profit" company and will own and manage iGOT-Karmayogi platform. The SPV will create and operationalize the content, market place and manage key business services of iGOT-Karmayogi platform, relating to content validation, independent proctored assessments and telemetry data availability. The SPV will own all Intellectual Property Rights on behalf of the Government of India. An appropriate monitoring and evaluation framework will also be put in place for performance evaluation of all users of the iGOT-Karmayogi platform so as to generate a dashboard view of Key Performance Indicators.


    Background

A transformational change in Civil Service Capacity is proposed to be affected by organically linking the transformation of work culture, strengthening public institutions and adopting modern technology to build civil service capacity with the overall aim of ensuring efficient delivery of services to citizens.


    A Public Human Resources Council comprising of select Union Ministers, Chief Ministers, eminent public HR practitioners, thinkers, global thought leaders and Public Service functionaries under the Chairmanship of Hon'ble Prime Minister will serve as the apex body for providing strategic direction to the task of Civil Services Reform and capacity building.
