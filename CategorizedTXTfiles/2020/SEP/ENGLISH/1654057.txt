      Promoting research under New Education Policy
      Posted On: 14 SEP 2020 4:41PM by PIB Delhi


    The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes to catalyse quality academic research in all fields.


    Most of the research area in various schemes are decided by panel of expert academicians and researchers, and all researchers at various institutes carry out research in their own area of interests. Though the Government wants research to benefit the nation as a whole by promoting research in local problems as well as emerging technologies, there has not been any restrictions on the areas of research to be carried out in the nation.


    The Para 10.11 of NEP 2020, talks a great deal about Institutional autonomy. It specifically states, “All HEIs will gradually move towards full autonomy - academic and administrative - in order to enable this vibrant culture.” It also mentions stage-wise mechanism for granting graded autonomy to colleges, through a transparent system of graded accreditation, will be established.


    According to the NEP 2020, faculty will have the autonomy to innovate on matters of curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment within a broad framework of higher education qualifications that ensures consistency across institutions and programmes and across the ODL, online, and traditional ‘in-class’ modes.


    The information was given by the Union Minister for Human Resource Development, Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ in a written reply in the LokSabha today.
