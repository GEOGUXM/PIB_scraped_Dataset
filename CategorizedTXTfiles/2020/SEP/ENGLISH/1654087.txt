      Posted On: 14 SEP 2020 5:29PM by PIB Delhi


    The National Statistical Office (NSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation is releasing Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Base 2012=100 for Rural (R), Urban (U) and Combined (C) for the month of August 2020 (Provisional) in this press note. The corresponding Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) for all India Rural, Urban and Combined are also being released.


    2. The Price data are collected from representative and selected 1114 urban markets and 1181 villages covering all States/UTs through personal visits by field staff of Field Operations Division of NSO, MoSPI on a weekly roster. During the month of August, 2020, NSO collected prices from 96.1% villages and 96.4% urban markets while the market-wise numbers of prices reported therein were 78.6% for rural and 84.4% for urban as compared to 87.9% for rural and 93.9% for urban in February 2020. It may be seen that as various pandemic related restrictions were gradually lifted and non-essential activities started resuming operations, availability of price data has also improved. CPIs for Sub-Groups, Groups, General CPI (R, U & C), CFPI (R, U & C) at All India level and State-wise General CPI (R, U & C) are being released for all State/UTs.
