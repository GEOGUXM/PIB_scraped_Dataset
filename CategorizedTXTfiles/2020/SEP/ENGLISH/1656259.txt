      Posted On: 18 SEP 2020 5:29PM by PIB Delhi


    Government proposes to replace Level crossings (LC) in the country with Road Over Bridges (ROB) on cost sharing basis with State Govt, if Train Vehicle Unit (TVU) of LC is more than one lakh. Road under bridges (RUB) are provided to replace the level crossing, wherever technically feasible.


    Total 2834 LCs were replaced by ROB/RUBs between 01.04.2015 till 31.03.2020.


    Total expenditure of ₹ 15628 Cr. has been made towards replacement of LCs by ROB/RUBs from 01.04.2015 till 31.03.2020.


    During the current year, an allocation of ₹ 3575 Cr. has been made for ROB/RUBs. Total 7785 LCs are sanctioned for replacement by ROB/RUB, which are in various stages of progress.


    Railways, in a mission mode, eliminated all Unmanned Level Crossings (UMLCs) on Broad Gauge (BG) by 31.01.2019. UMLC on Meter Gauge (MG) and Narrow Gauge (NG) routes, wherever found feasible, will be eliminated along with Gauge conversion projects.


    This information was given by the Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
