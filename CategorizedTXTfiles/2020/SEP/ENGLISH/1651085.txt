    Advisory issued on safety precautions for rural Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) service providers


    In compliance of the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s Order for ensuring safe drinking water during lock down period due to CoVID-19 pandemic, Department of Drinking Water & Sanitation had issued an advisory to all States/ UTs on April 13, 2020.With the lockdown eased out and socio-economic activities resumed, especially with the commencement of post-monsoon working season, the water supply infrastructure activities have to be implemented on a bigger scale and with speed to achieve the goal of providing tap water connections to all rural households. Hence, it is imperative for WASH service providers at the forefront to follow all the necessary precautions to avoid contraction and spread of the virus.Current evidence indicates that the CoVid-19 virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets or contact, and transmission occurs when contaminated hands touch the mucosa of the mouth, nose, or eyes; the virus can also be transferred from one surface to another by contaminated hands , which facilitates indirect contact transmission. To ensure hand hygiene is practiced through hand wash at regular intervals, there is an urgent need to make tap water available inside every rural household premises. For this purpose, adequate fund has been made available under JalJeevan Mission. The mission presents an excellent opportunity to mitigate the ongoing pandemic situation not just by ensuring water supply but also by generating employment to labour who have migrated back home.
