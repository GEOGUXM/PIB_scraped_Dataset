      Posted On: 15 SEP 2020 6:55PM by PIB Delhi


    National Centre for Seismology (NCS) maintains a National SeismologicalNetwork (NSN) to detect and locate earthquakes in and around the country. A total of 413earthquakes have been recorded by NSN during 01st March, 2020 to 08th September, 2020.

    At present, there is no proven scientific technique available, anywhere in the world, to predicttheoccurrenceoftheearthquakeswithreasonabledegreeofaccuracywithrespect to location, time of occurrence and magnitude. The current scientific knowledge about earthquake processes, which is a very complex phenomena, is not matured to the level of prediction.
