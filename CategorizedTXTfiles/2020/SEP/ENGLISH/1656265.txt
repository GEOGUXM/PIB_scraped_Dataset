    As per guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, these special train coaches are to be used by the State Governments only after they have exhausted their own medical facilities. As on date, 813 coaches have been provided by IR as requisitioned by the State Governments (De1hi-503, Uttar Pradesh-270 and Bihar-40).


    For conversion of these coaches into Covid Care Coaches, minor modifications like removal of middle berth and conversion of one toilet into shower room was carried out with provision of medical facilities and other items. The average cost of carrying out modifications and provision of medical facilities including oxygen cylinders and other items is approximately ₹60,000/- per coach. Average expenditure of approximately ₹7,000/- has been incurred per patient in the covid care coaches.


    This information was given by the Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
