    *ESY – Ethanol Supply Year (1 st Dec to 30 th Nov)


    Based on the offers received so far from ethanol manufacturers, the amount of ethanol contracted by OMCs for supply during the current ESY is 192.87 crore litre.


    National Biofuel Policy -2018 envisages an indicative target of 20% blending of ethanol in petrol to be achieved by 2030. The ethanol blending depends on the availability of ethanol which further depends on availability of raw material for ethanol production viz, sugarcane, damaged food-grains unfit for human consumption, etc. and supply demand scenario in other ethanol consuming sectors like potable alcohol, pharma, chemical, petrochemicals, etc


    Department of Food and Public Distribution (DFPD) has informed that ethanol produced either from molasses or sugarcane is same and equally beneficial.


    The names of major mills which are producing ethanol directly from sugarcane juice/sugar/sugar syrup are annexed .


    The important measures taken to increase the production of ethanol for blending include:

     1. Encouraging production of ethanol from sugarcane juice and sugar/sugar syrup.
     2. Fixing remunerative ex-mill price of ethanol from various feed stocks.

    (iii) Extending interest subvention to distilleries.


    (iv) Amendment to Industries (Development & Regulation) Act, 1951, for free movement of denatured ethanol for Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme.


    (v) Reduction in Goods & Service Tax on ethanol meant for EBP Programme from 18% to 5%.


    (vi) Extension of EBP Programme to whole of India except island UTs of Andaman Nicobar and Lakshadweep with effect from 01.04.2019.


    (vii) Enhancing ethanol storage at Oil Marketing Companies locations,


    (viii) Formulating an “Ethanol Procurement Policy on a longtermbasis under Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme”.


    This information was given by the Union Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas Shri Dharmendra Pradhan in the Lok Sabha today in a written reply.
