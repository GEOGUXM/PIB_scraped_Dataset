      Posted On: 18 SEP 2020 5:53PM by PIB Delhi


    A total of approx. 8 LMT foodgrains (Rice and Wheat) were allocated to States/UTs. Also, Under ANB whole Chana was provided @ 1kg per household per month for two months i.e. May-June 2020, free of cost to migrant labourers who were not covered under NFSA, 2013 or were without ration card in the States/UTs in which they were stranded. Such beneficiaries were estimated as 10% of total beneficiaries under NFSA.


    Under the ANB, against adjusted total allocation of 27,001.19 MT whole Chana for two months (May-June, 2020), 16,600.81 MT has been distributed by States/UTs to the stranded migrant workers. A statement providing details of State-wise allocation, lifting and distribution of foodgrains and chana whole under the package, is enclosed at Annexure-I and Annexure-II respectively.
