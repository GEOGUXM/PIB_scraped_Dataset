      Prices of Petrol/Diesel
      Posted On: 19 SEP 2020 3:52PM by PIB Delhi


    Prices of petrol and diesel have been made market-determined with effect from 26.06.2010 and 19.10.2014 respectively. Since then, the Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) take appropriate decision on pricing of petrol and diesel, in line with international product prices and other market conditions. The OMCs have not only increased but also decreased the prices of petrol and diesel, in line with changes in international prices and rupee dollar exchange rate.


    The prices of petrol and diesel in the country are benchmarked to their international product prices. Generally, the prices of petroleum products in the country are higher/lower than other countries due to various factors, including prevailing tax regime and subsidy compensations by the respective Governments, the details of which are not maintained by the Government.
