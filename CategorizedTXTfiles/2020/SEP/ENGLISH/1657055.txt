    The utilization of immunization services slowed down at the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, but coverage has improved subsequently because of series of measures been taken.


    To restore universal immunization, following steps were taken by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW) during COVID-19 pandemic:

      * States/ UTs have been provided with a series of guidelines for delivering immunization services as well as Reproductive, Maternal, New born, Child, Adolescent Health Plus Nutrition (RMNCAH+N) services in the midst of COVID 19 pandemic. The same have also been reiterated in video conferences with the states/ UTs. Guidelines are also uploaded on Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW) website for wider dissemination.
  * Regular reviews are being held with the States/ UTs to discuss challenges being faced during the pandemic and the necessary measures taken to ensure immunization services.               
  * Appropriate communication material has been developed and shared with the States and UTs for addressing vaccine hesitancy and strengthening routine immunization during COVID-19 pandemic.
  * Supply chain of vaccines and other logistics has been ensured during COVID-19 pandemic.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                              

    As per Health Management Information System (HMIS) 37,49,939 children were fully immunized in rural areas from April- June 2020 whereas 46,75,437 children have been fully immunized in rural areas during same period last year.


    After each immunization session, due list of beneficiaries is prepared to track and trace individuals who have missed their regular vaccine including individual, who have missed vaccination due to COVID-19 pandemic


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
