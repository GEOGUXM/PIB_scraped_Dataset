    Union Education Minister Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ virtually confers SecondUtkrishtSansthanVishwakarma Award in 14 categories to the Institutions under AICTE on Vishwakarma Divas Celebration. The Utkrisht SansthanVishwakarma Award is being organized by All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) since 2019, which aims to motivate, recognize and honor the AICTE approved institutions to raise their performance in the specific domain leading to significant contribution for the growth and development of the society.


    India is facing an extraordinary challenge to protect citizens from the rapidly spreading COVID-19 pandemic all around the globe, ShriPokhriyal said. Since the technical education community in the country is well-capable of serving the community by utilizing its vast knowledge and ample resources. Therefore, in order to motivate and honor technical institutions, AICTE under its UtkrishtSansthanVishwakarma Award (USVA) 2020 has proposed the theme of the year as “INDIA FIGHTS CORONA”, he added.

He further informed that more than 900 institutions were registered for the award this year. 535 applications were considered for the first round of evaluation. These applications were scrutinized by a Committee of experts nominated for the purpose of evaluation, who shortlisted 103 institutions under 14 categories for the next round of evaluation conducted at Regional Offices. Out of 103 institutions, 34 were selected for the awards.


    The Minister congratulated the 34 institutions awarded with the Vishwakarma Award, who provided their services and support to the society and government in this difficult time.
