    The year-wise data of crime against women as per National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) during the years 2016 to 2018 is at Annexure-I .


    The Government attaches high priority to ensuring safety and security of women and has undertaken various legislative and schematic interventions in this regard. These include legislations such as ‘The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018’, ‘The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013’, ‘The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013’, ‘The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2006’, ‘The Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986’, ‘The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961’, ‘The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956’ etc. and schemes such as those of One Stop Centres, Universalisation of Women Helpline, Mahila Police Volunteers, Swadhar, Ujjawala etc.


    The data of suicides committed by women on account of dowry related issues during 2017-2019 as per NCRB report is at Annexure-II .


    ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibilities to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens rest primarily with the respective State Governments.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister of Women and Child Development, Smt. Smriti Zubin Irani in Lok Sabha today.
