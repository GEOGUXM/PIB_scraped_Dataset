    The Government is working with commitment to ensure Development with Dignity, Empowerment without Discrimination, which has ensured prosperity in life of weaker and other needy sections of the society including Minorities. This approach of the Government has led to Minorities being equal partners with other communities, in the educational & socio-economic development of the country. No such report received in the Ministry to suggest that certain groups are making organised efforts to spread distrust and misconceptions among minorities.

    Most of the socio economic and educational empowerment schemes and programmes of the Central Government are meant for the socio economically poor and deprived sections of the society, including the six notified minorities, who are getting benefitted. However, data regarding number of persons of minority communities brought above poverty line in the country is not maintained in the Ministry.
