    The key overall thrust of the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020, as laid down in the fundamental principles that will guide both the education system at large, as well as the individual institutions within it, is emphasis on conceptual understanding, rather than rote learning and learning for exams. The focus is on children learning how to learn. It aims at not only cognitive development, but also building character and creating holistic and well-rounded individuals equipped with the key 21st century skills.


    NEP emphasizes to bring Out of School Children back to schools and to prevent children from dropping out by providing effective and sufficient infrastructure in the schools, regular trained teachers at each stage, safe and practical conveyances and/or hostels, alternative and innovative education centres and by achieving universal participation in school by carefully tracking students as well as their learning levels. Further, under Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Samagra Shiksha, financial assistance is provided to the States and UTs for various activities to reduce number of dropouts, which include opening/strengthening of new schools upto senior secondary level, construction of school buildings & additional classrooms, setting up, up-gradation and running of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas, setting up of residential schools/hostels, free uniforms, free text books, transport allowance and undertaking enrolment drives, residential as well as non residential trainings for mainstreaming of Out of School Children, Seasonal Hostels/ residential camps etc. Financial assistance is also provided for Inclusive Education of children with special needs. Also, Mid-Day-Meal is provided to students at the elementary level of education.


    This information was given by the Union Minister for Human Resource Development, Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
