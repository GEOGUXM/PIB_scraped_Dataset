    The number of medical colleges have increased by around 45% over the last six years. Number of medical colleges in 2014 was 381. The number of MBBS seats have also increased by 48% over the last six years from 54,348 in 2014 to 80,312 in 2020. The Government is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme to establish new medical colleges attached with District/Referral hospitals in underserved areas of the Country. 157 new medical colleges have been approved under the scheme of which 43 have already become functional.


    As on date, in the case of government medical colleges, the respective State governments are responsible for fixation of fee and in the case of private unaided medical colleges, the fee structure is decided by a Committee set up by the respective State Government under the Chairmanship of a retired High Court Judge in pursuance of the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. It is for the Committee to decide whether the fee proposed by an Institute is justified and the fee fixed by the Committee is binding on the Institute.


    Further, clause (i) of Sub-section (1) of Section 10 of National Medical Commission Act, 2019 provides for framing of guidelines for determination of fees and all other charges in respect of fifty percent of seats in private medical institutions and deemed to be universities which are governed under the provisions of the Act.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
