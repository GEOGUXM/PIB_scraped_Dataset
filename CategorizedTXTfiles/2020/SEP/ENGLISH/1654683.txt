    Inclusion of new works under the Scheme is a regular exercise to expand the ambit of work offered under the Scheme. In this direction, recently on 2.7.2020, the permissible works under the Scheme has been enhanced to 262 numbers by adding unskilled wage component of 230 persondays for construction of Community Sanitary Complexes in convergence with Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen).


    The Ministry also issues convergence guidelines with other Ministries/ Departments from time to time to enhance the creation of durable asset by creating more opportunities in rural areas. Following guidelines have been issued recently:


     1. A DO Letter dated 24.04.2020 jointly signed by Secretary, DoRD, Secretary, DoWR, RD&GR, Secretary, DoLR and Secretary, DoDWS has been sent to Chief Secretaries of all States/UTs to emphasize personal efforts for significant positive impact in the area of water conservation and water management in the country. The activities include augmentation of existing water sources(s), ground water recharge, rainwater harvesting and grey water management and recharge. Rejuvenation of traditional water bodies, small rivers are encouraged. These activities would ensure water source sustainability in rural areas and would strengthen ongoing Jal Jeevan Mission being implemented by MoJS.

     2. Guidelines dated 04.05.2020 for promoting Nutri-Garden for individual beneficiaries and community in convergence with State Schemes and NRLM
     3. Joint Guidelines dated 10.06.2020 for construction of Gram Panchayat Bhawan in convergence with MoPR and FC Funds for FY 2020-21.
     4. Joint Guidelines dated 26.06.2020 for convergence with Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DAHD) to promote fodder farms
