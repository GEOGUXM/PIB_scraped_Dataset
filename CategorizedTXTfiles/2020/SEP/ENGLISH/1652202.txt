      Situation Update : Situation in Eastern Ladakh
      Posted On: 08 SEP 2020 10:49AM by PIB Delhi


    India, while is committed to disengagement and de-escalating the situation on the LAC, China continues to undertake provocative activities to escalate.


    At no stage has the Indian Army transgressed across the LAC or resorted to use of any aggressive means, including firing.


    It is the PLA that has been blatantly violating agreements and carrying out aggressive manoeuvres, while engagement at military, diplomatic and political level is in progress. In the instant case on 07 September 2020, it was the PLA troops who were attempting to close-in with one of our forward positions along the LAC and when dissuaded by own troops, PLA troops fired a few rounds in the air in an attempt to intimidate own troops. However, despite the grave provocation, own troops exercised great restraint and behaved in a mature and responsible manner.


    The Indian Army is committed to maintaining peace and tranquility, however is also determined to protect national integrity and sovereignty at all costs. The statement by the Western Theatre Command is an attempt to mislead their domestic and international audience.
