      Posted On: 15 SEP 2020 3:01PM by PIB Delhi


    Health is a State subject. Such data is not maintained at Central level by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. However, database of those seeking relief under the “Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Insurance Package” is maintained at national level.


    Ministry of Health and Family Welfare provided guideline on Infection Prevention and Control practices to the State Governments. Training was conducted for all the States in the month of March 2020. A training plan was also conveyed to States to complete training up to district level by 20 th March 2020.


    Training on Infection Prevention and Control was also made available for all category of healthcare workers on the iGoT platform.


    States were asked to constitute Infection Prevention and Control committees. Hospitals were also to identify a nodal officer who will monitor the healthcare workers and review their exposure status. High risk exposures are placed under quarantine for 7 days. Based on their exposure/clinical profile such doctors, nursing officers and other health workers, a decision shall be taken by the Nodal Officer/Head of the Department (or his appointed Sub-committee) for further period of one week. An advisory for managing health care workers working in COVID and Non-COVID areas of the hospital was issued by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on 18 th June, 2020.


    Guidelines on rational use of PPEs for hospital and community settings (including front line workers) were issued on 24.03.2020. These guidelines followed a risk based approach and recommended type of PPE that needs to be used in high and low risk areas.


    The healthcare workers were provided with hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis and prevention of infection.


    N-95 masks and triple / double ply masks were brought under price control.


    Export of PPEs, N 95 masks, triple/ double ply medical masks, goggles and visors were banned till such time we were self-reliant.


    The package of Rs 15000 crores (USD 2 Billion) under “India COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness Package” was been approved by the Cabinet on 22 nd April, 2020. The funds and commodities are allocated to the states under various components including Emergency COVID-19 response. The States were supported with 9.81 Crore tablets of Hydroxychloroquine and 28,476 ventilators supplied to States/UTs.


    Initial part of the Pandemic, there were concerns on non-availability of protective gears. However, with Government of India stepping in to enhance capacity and allocating PPE to States as per need, this concern was addressed. States/UTs were provided with 3.05 crore N-95 masks and 1.2 Crore PPE kits.
