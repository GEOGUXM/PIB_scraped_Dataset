    Further, as part of ‘AtmaNirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’, various other incentives/reliefs have been provided for the Real Estate Sector such as; special refinancing facility of ₹ 10,000 crore at Reserve Bank of India’s Policy Repo Rate to National Housing Bank for supporting Housing Finance Companies (HFCs ); ₹ 45,000 crore Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme for Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and ₹ 30,000 crore Special Liquidity Scheme for Microfinance Institutions, NBFC & HFCs; extension of Credit Link Subsidy Scheme under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana- Urban till 31 st March 2021; Scheme for Affordable Rental Housing Complexes for migrant labours and urban poor.
