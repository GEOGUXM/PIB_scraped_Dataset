      Posted On: 04 SEP 2020 4:43PM by PIB Delhi


    Central Water Commission is monitoring live storage status of 123 reservoirs of the country on weekly basis. Out of these reservoirs, 43 reservoirs have hydropower benefit with installed capacity of more than 60 MW. The total live storage capacity of these 123 reservoirs is 171.091 BCM which is about 66.36% of the live storage capacity of 257.812 BCM which is estimated to have been created in the country.


    As per reservoir storage data, live storage available in these reservoirs is 139.158 BCM, which is 81% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. However, last year the live storage available in these reservoirs for the corresponding period was 134.425 BCM and the average of last 10 years live storage was 116.268 BCM. Thus, the live storage available in 123 reservoirs 104% of the live storage of corresponding period of last year and 120% of storage of average of last ten years. The overall storage position is better than the corresponding period of last year in the country as a whole and is better than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.


    The Northern region includes States of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan. There are 8 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 19.17 BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 14.52 BCM which is 76% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 91% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 81% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is less than the corresponding period of last year and is also less than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.


    The Eastern region includes States of Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Tripura and Nagaland. There are 18 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 19.43 BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 14.28 BCM which is 73% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 70% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 62% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is better than the corresponding period of last year and is also better than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.


    The Western region includes States of Gujarat and Maharashtra. There are 42 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 35.24 BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 30.60 BCM which is 87% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 79% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 65% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is better than the storage of last year and is also better than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.


    The Central region includes States of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. There are 19 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 44.45BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 38.12 BCM which is 86% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 79% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 71% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is better than the storage of last year and is also better than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.


    The Southern region includes States of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, AP&TG (2combined projects in both states), Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. There are 36reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 52.81 BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 41.64 BCM which is 79% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 77% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 64% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is better than the corresponding period of last year and is also better than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.
