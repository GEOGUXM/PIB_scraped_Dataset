    After a gap of about 6 months due to the Corona pandemic, “Hunar Haat” will restart from 09 th October 2020 with the theme of “Local to Global” and focus on indigenous exquisite Indian toys.


    Union Minister for Minority Affairs Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi today said here that every corner of the country has a traditional and ancestral legacy of indigenous toys. This legacy, which was on the verge of extinction, has got a boon after Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi pitched for “Swadeshi Toys”. The Indian toy industry has got tremendous boost after the call for “Vocal for Local Toys”.


    Shri Naqvi said that every corner of the country is endowed with diversity of indigenous toys made with wood, brass, bamboo, glass, cloth, paper, clay etc. “Hunar Haat” will be an enormous platform providing market and opportunities to master artisans who prepare these indigenous exquisite toys.

Shri Naqvi said that “Hunar Haat”, which will restart from 09 th October 2020, will be organised with the theme of “Local to Global”. The next “Hunar Haat” will be organised at Prayagraj from 9 to 18 October, 2020. More than 30 per cent stalls will be for artisans who prepare indigenous toys, they will also be extended help through various institutions for attractive packaging of “Swadeshi Toys”.


    Shri Naqvi said that “Hunar Haat”, which has provided employment and employment opportunities to more than 5 lakh Indian artisans, craftsmen, culinary experts and other people associated with them in the last 5 years, have become popular among the people. “Hunar Haat”, which provides market and opportunity to master artisans and craftsmen from remote areas of the country, has become a credible brand of rare exquisite indigenous handmade products.


    The Minority Affairs Ministry has organised more than 2 dozen “Hunar Haat” so far across the country where lakhs of artisans, craftsmen have been provided employment and employment opportunities through these “Hunar Haat”. In the coming days, “Hunar Haat” will be organized at Jaipur (23 Oct -1 November 2020), Chandigarh (7- 15 November 2020), Indore (21 to 29 November 2020), Mumbai (22 to 31 December 2020), Hyderabad (8 to 17 January 2021), Lucknow (23 to 31 January 2021), India Gate, New Delhi (13 to 21 February 2021), Ranchi (20 to 28 February 2021), Kota (5 to 14 March 2021), Surat/Ahmedabad (20 to 27 March 2021) etc.


    Shri Naqvi said that this time, people will also be able to buy “Hunar Haat” products digital and online also. Union Minority Affairs Ministry is registering these artisans and their indigenous products on “GeM” (Government e Marketplace). Several export promotion councils have shown interest to provide international markets at large scale for handmade indigenous products of these artisans and craftsmen.


    Shri Naqvi said that lakhs of master artisans and craftsmen from across the country are happy and excited that “Hunar Haat” is going to be organised again.
