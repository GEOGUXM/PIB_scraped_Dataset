      Posted On: 18 SEP 2020 5:13PM by PIB Delhi


    The existing Order under Jute Packaging Materials ( JPM) Act, 1987 dated 20 th December, 2019 stipulates that 100% of Foodgrains and 20% sugar are required to be packed compulsorily in jute bags. This Order is valid upto 30 th September, 2020. As per stipulation of the Order, different state foodgrains procuring agencies including Food Corporation of India (FCI) purchase jute bags to the tune of around 30.0 lakh bales for packing foodgrains. The total purchase currently constitutes about 76.0% of the total production of jute goods and 96% of the total production of sacking by the jute mills.


    The shortfall in supply was met by granting relaxation for use of H igh-density polyethylene or polypropylene ( HDPE/PP) bags as per provisions of JPM Act , 1987. The Government also permitted D/o Food and Public Distribution to use used jute bags during Covid-19 situation. In RMS 2020-21, relaxation to the tune of total 7.01 lakh bales were given for use of HDPE/PP bags.


    Government is implementing a credit linked Scheme called Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (ATUFS) for technology upgradation of the textile industry with one time capital subsidy for eligible machinery. Segments which have higher employment and export potential such as Garmenting and Technical Textiles are eligible for capital subsidy at the rate of 15% subject to cap of Rs.30 crore. Segments such as weaving for brand new Shuttle-less Looms (including weaving preparatory and knitting), Processing, Jute, Silk and Handlooms get subsidy at the rate of 10% subject to a cap of Rs. 20 crore.. Year-wise subsidy released to the textile units in weaving and knitting Segment is provided in the table below:
