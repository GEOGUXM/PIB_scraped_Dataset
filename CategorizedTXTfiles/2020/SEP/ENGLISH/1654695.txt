      Construction of Panchayat Buildings
      Posted On: 15 SEP 2020 8:03PM by PIB Delhi


    Panchayat being a State subject, providing Panchayat Building in Gram Panchayats (GPs) is primarily the responsibility of State Governments. The States are expected to mobilise funds for construction of Panchayat Buildings from various sources. However, to supplement efforts of states, the Ministry under its different scheme/s has been providing financial assistance to States/UTs for construction of Panchayat Bhawans. Under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) scheme of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA), being implemented w.e.f 2018-19 also has a provision to provide funds to States/UTs for construction of GP building on limited scale at the rate of Rs. 20 lakhs per GP building and construction of approx 4500 GP buildings have been approved under the scheme. Details of GP Buildings constructed under the various schemes are maintained at State/ UT level. As per information available, out of 256765 GPs/ Rural Local Bodies (RLBs) across States/ UTs, 197108 GPs have Panchayat Buildings and 59657 GPs are without Panchayat Buildings. State-wise detail is at Annexure.


    Keeping in view felt need of Gram Panchayat Buildings and also taking into consideration limited resources under RGSA, the States have been advised to ensure that the construction of GP buildings are taken up on priority by converging funds / resources under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), unspent funds of 14th Finance Commission , funds from 15th Finance Commission and also those from State schemes etc., so as to saturate the gap by the end of year 2022.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister of Rural Development & Panchayati Raj Shri Narendra Singh Tomar in Lok Sabha today.
