    These projects are at various stages of implementation, and the target date for completion at the time of inception of these projects is usually 2-3 years from the date of sanction of the project.


    Under the schemes of this Ministry, projects are usually sanctioned based on proposals prioritised by the State Governments. There is presently no project sanctioned, or pending for sanction, for RCC Bridge over river Jaljali connecting Nagarbera of Kamrup district and riverine areas of Alopati char of Barpeta district in this Ministry.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge), Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in Lok Sabha today.
