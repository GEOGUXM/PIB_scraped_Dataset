      * The need for a National Mission on Foundational Literacy and Numeracy- also established from the results of various national surveys such as the National Achievement Survey (NAS): Low learning levels; increased dropout rate; and inappropriate language and mathematical skills.
      * Universal objectives of FLN - Making learners competent in doing meaningful reading and writing by the time they enter grade 3; Developing the basic understanding and competencies related to numeracy and its related concepts among young learners till grade 2; and Developing skills among the learners to amalgamate their outside school experiences in their classroom learning to attain foundational literacy and numeracy in a better way.
      * Elements of the 3-month play-based ‘School Preparation Module’, for Preparatory Class i.e., ‘Balvatika” would include: activities and workbooks around- Sounds, Words,Alphabets, Colors, Shapes and Numbers; and involve collaborations with peers and parents.
      * Effective implementation of Foundational Literacy and Numeracy, integration of literacy and numeracy is crucial, with Mathematical terminology as a part of daily language and Use of language in understanding mathematical ideas.
      * Importance of adopting an ELPS approaches was emphasized, wherein: E is for Experience with physical objects, L is spoken Language that describes the experience, P is pictures that represent the experience and S is written symbols that generalize the experience.

      * Reading skills which were very spontaneous and natural for those who are given opportunities to read. Three important indicators associated with Reading under Foundational Literacy are: Shapes of letters and sounds associated with them (Graphonics); sentence structure (Syntax); and meaning of words (Semantics).
      * Writing with coherence of thought which is important for Foundational Literacy and under this it has been well established that 85% of the time is spent on thinking what to write.
      * Formation of a National Book Promotion Policy to ensure the availability, accessibility, quality and readership of books. This would entail significant expansion of public and school libraries and establishment of digital libraries.
