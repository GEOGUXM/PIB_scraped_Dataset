    Presently, CHILDLINE services are available in 594 Districts. As on 01.01.2018, CHILDLINE services were available in 413 Districts. As on 15.09.2020, the coverage has been enhanced to 594 Districts. Average wait time/duration for the Child Helpline depends on the traffic of calls at a particular time. The mandate for the Childline team is to reach the incident spot within 60 minutes of receiving a case complaint. However, the actual response time depends also on factors such as geographical location (hilly area, metro city), availability of transport, etc. Further, a Committee under the Chairpersonship of Minister of State for Women and Child Development, has been constituted to look into re-organizing the functionality of Childline.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister of Women and Child Development Smt. Smriti Zubin Irani in Rajya Sabha today.
