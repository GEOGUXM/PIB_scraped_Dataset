    Government supports Research Institutes, Central & State Agriculture Universities for competitive R&D and demonstration activities in Agriculture Biotechnology including organic farming. The Biotech-Krishi Innovation Science Application Network (Biotech-KISAN) programme also focuses on taking innovative technologies to the farmers. The activity has been supported across the country including Aspirational Districts. During the last three years, approximately Rs. 310 crores has been invested for supporting the use of Biotechnology in agriculture including organic farming through these programmes.


    Twenty States and two Union Territories have prepared their own Biotechnology policy. (Details are provided in Annexure I.)


    Government through Department of Biotechnology (DBT) has implemented integrated Human Resource Development Program in Biotechnology to provide Biotechnology trained personnel in various fields including agriculture. Some of the major programmes include Postgraduate Teaching Program, DBT-Junior Research Fellowship Program, DBT- Research Associate ship and DBT-Biotechnology industry Training Program (Apprenticeship) Program for skilled and trained manpower etc. These programmes are supported across the country.
