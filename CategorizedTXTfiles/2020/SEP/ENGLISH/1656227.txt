    Speaking about the latest index, Shri Santosh Gangwar, Minister of State (I/C) for Labour and Employment said, “The continued softening of inflation in succession for seven months may be mainly attributed to the relief measures announced by the Govt. to help poor people including labourers during the COVID-19 pandemic.” He added that “The increase in the index will have a positive impact on the wages of millions of workers working in the unorganized sector in rural areas.”


    Shri DPS Negi, Director General of Labour Bureau while releasing the index said “Labour Bureau has been able to bring out the monthly indices as per the pre-defined schedule consistently even during the tough time of COVID-19.”
