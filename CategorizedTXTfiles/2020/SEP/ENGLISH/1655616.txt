      Increase in Salaries of Anganwadi Workers
      Posted On: 17 SEP 2020 3:56PM by PIB Delhi


    Government has advised public including women to take all precautions for prevention from COVID19, while pursuing professions. Measures such as work from home, on line teaching, tele medicine consultations etc have been encouraged. Anganwadi Workers, ANMs and ASHAs have been engaged in facilitating essential services during COVID19 pendemic.


    With effect from 1st October, 2018, the Government has enhanced honorarium to Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) from ₹ 3,000/- to ₹ 4,500/- per month; AWWs at mini-AWCs from ₹ 2,250/- to ₹ 3,500/- per month; Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) from ₹ 1,500/- to ₹ 2,250/- per month; and introduced performance linked incentive of ₹ 250/- per month to AWHs. Further, the AWWs are allowed performance linked incentive of ₹ 500/- per month for using ICDS-CAS under POSHAN Abhiyaan.


    In addition to the honoraria paid by the Government of India, the States/UTs are also giving monetary incentives to these workers out of their own resources.


    The incentives to ASHAs finalized at the national level are regularly reviewed and activities for which ASHAs would get incentives are expanded from time to time. These incentives provided to ASHAs are in addition to expenditure incurred by States/UTs. In FY 2018-19 the Union Cabinet approved the revised amount of routine recurrent incentive for ASHAs under NHM from Rs.1000/month to Rs. 2000/month. An additional incentive of Rs 1000 per month is also paid, in view of their significant contribution towards the Covid-19 pandemic related work. Besides the above, States/UTs have been asked to ensure provision of safety tools like masks and sanitizers for ASHAs and under the recently launched Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package, Insurance Scheme has been introduced for all health workers, including ASHAs. This insurance scheme provides an insurance cover of Rs. 50 Lakhs in case of loss of life due to COVID 19 pandemic or else due to accident on account of COVID19 related duty.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister of Women and Child Development Smt. Smriti Zubin Irani in Rajya Sabha today.
