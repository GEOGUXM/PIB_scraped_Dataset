    The Government regularly reviews the country’s import policy, based on emerging trade and economic factors. Decisions to regulate imports are taken based on the assessment in national and public interest. At present, approximately 550 tariff lines are under the ‘Restricted’ / ‘Prohibited’ category for imports under the Foreign Trade Policy, imports of which are restricted from all countries including China.


    To support and expand domestic capacities, Government has also implemented policies to promote the domestic manufacturing through ease of doing business and production linked incentives (PLSs), including in the field of mobile phones and electronics components and bulk drugs and medical devices, in line with the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat.


    The full impact of the promotional measures on the industry will be discernible as the global economy recovers.


    This information was given by the Union Minister of Commerce and Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
