      Modernisation of Major Ports
      Posted On: 14 SEP 2020 5:19PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government of India has taken concerted efforts in the direction of expansion and modernization of major ports of the country. Infrastructure development and capacity augmentation of major ports is an ongoing process. It involves construction of new berths and terminals, mechanization of existing berths and terminals, capital dredging for deepening of drafts for attracting large vessels in port channels, development of road and rail connectivity etc. As a result, the cargo handling capacity of the major ports has gone upto 1534.91 Million Tonnes Per Annum(MTPA) as on 31 st March 2020. Accordingly, Vishakhapatnam Port Trust has developed plans with investments from private sector in addition to the investments from internal resources in the major thrust areas of â€œdeepening of channels and berths. The current capacity of Vishakhapatnam Port Trust(VPT) is 126.89 million tonnes. With the completion of ongoing capacity addition projects, the capacity is projected to be 141.64 million tonnes by FY 2023. A list of projects for modernization and mechanization accomplished by Port of Visakhapatnam are at Annexure.
