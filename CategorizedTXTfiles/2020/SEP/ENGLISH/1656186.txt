      Posted On: 18 SEP 2020 4:19PM by PIB Delhi


    There have been reports in the media regarding planned surgeries being cancelled/affected due to Covid-19 pandemic. However, Public Health & Hospitals being State subjects, such information is not maintained centrally.


    As far as three Central Government Hospitals in Delhi viz. Safdarjung, Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) and Lady Hardinge Medical College (LHMC) & Associated Hospitals, are concerned, elective operation theatres were closed w.e.f. 18.03.2020 and elective surgeries resumed w.e.f. 01.09.2020 in Safdarjung Hospital. However, during the period of March, 2020 to 10.09.2020, a total number of 3356 numbers of emergency surgeries were done in Safdarjung Hospital.


    In Dr. RML Hospital, planned surgeries were curtailed during COVID-19 for initial period of two months. As the norms of lockdown were relaxed, planned surgeries were resumed in a sequential manner. However, during the entire COVID period, emergency surgeries were never stopped and round the clock emergency surgeries were performed as and when required. No planned surgeries were cancelled or delayed in LHMC & Associated Hospitals. All emergency surgeries are being operated with proper screening of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, separate operations theatres were earmarked for surgery of suspected and confirmed cases.


    As far as All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi is concerned, some of the elective surgeries were postponed due to COVID-19. However, all emergency surgeries were undertaken regularly without any delay. Approximately 5958 surgeries of non COVID patients have been performed during the period from 25.03.2020 to 31.08.2020.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
