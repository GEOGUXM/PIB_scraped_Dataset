    Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd -RCF a PSU under the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers has started its Methanol Plant at Trombay Unit, Mumbai from 8th September 2020. This is a step towards Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan


    RCF has the capacity to produce 242 MT of Methanol per day. Till now, RCF has been importing Methanol for its internal consumption and also for trading purposes. With Methanol production of its own, RCF shall no longer be dependent on imports for its own requirement and will also be in a position to satisfy the needs of other Methanol dependent industries.


    With this, RCF has entered the selct list of Methanol producers in the country, providing alternate to import and thus contributing towards Government's ambitious 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' Abhiyaan.


    Methanol is widely being used in the production of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, dyestuff etc. With very limited domestic production, the requirement was being met till now with imports.


    In the endeavor to support self-sufficiency in fertilizers, RCF has ramped up the production of its popular complex fertilizer, SUPHALA 15:15:15 by enhancing its production from 1500 MT per day to 2200 MT per day. As a result, the production of SUPHALA increased by 17.3% in the month of August 2020 as compared to August 2019.


    During the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic period, despite facing multiple hurdles in the day-to-day operations including production and supply chain management, RCF has been able to achieve an increase of 10.81% in its fertilizer sales in the month of August 2020 as compared to August 2019.
