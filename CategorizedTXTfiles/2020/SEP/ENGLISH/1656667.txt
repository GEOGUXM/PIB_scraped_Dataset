      Posted On: 19 SEP 2020 5:01PM by PIB Delhi


    There have been no attacks by Pakistani forces on Indian positions along the Line of Control and International Border with Pakistan. However, Pakistan troops have been resorting to persistent ceasefire violations along the Line of Control. There have been 2453 incidents of Ceasefire Violations along Line of Control in Jammu region in this year (from 01 March to 07 September, 2020). In addition, 192 incidents of cross-border firing have occurred along Indo-Pak International Border in Jammu region in this year (01 March to 31 August, 2020).


    There have been 10 fatal casualties of Army personnel occurred along Line of Control/International Border in cross border firing by Pakistani forces in the last six months. The details of casualties of Pakistan side cannot be ascertained accurately.


    Appropriate retaliation to the ceasefire violations, as required, has been carried out by Indian Army/BSF. In addition, all the cases of ceasefire violations are taken up with Pakistan authorities through the established mechanisms of hotlines, flag meetings, Directorate General of Military Operations talks as well as diplomatic channels between the two countries. BSF too holds talks at various levels with its counterpart viz. Pakistan Rangers.


    Diplomatically, India has repeatedly emphasized, including at the highest level, the need for Pakistan to uphold the sanctity of the Line of Control (LC) and the International Border in Jammu & Kashmir as its obligations emanating from the Shimla Agreement and the Lahore Declaration.


    This information was given by Raksha Rajya Mantri Shri Shripad Naik in a written reply toDr. Fauzia Khan in Rajya Sabha today.
