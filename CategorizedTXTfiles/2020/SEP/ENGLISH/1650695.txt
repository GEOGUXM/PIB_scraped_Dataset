      Posted On: 02 SEP 2020 6:13PM by PIB Delhi


    One of the primary objectives of the Ministry of Jal Shakti is to make waterconservation a people’s movement and strengthen the water consciousness in the country. For furthering this objective, the Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Ministry of Jal Shakti has launched the ‘Water Heroes – Share Your Stories’ Contest from September 1, 2020 with an aim to reach out to people on the important subject of water conservation and management.


    Through this Water Heroes Contest, we hope to encourage and collect best practices in water conservation from across India. We also hope to disseminate such efforts across India to encourage more transformational efforts in this area. Every month (from September, 2020 onwards) entries would be invited for consideration of awards. Every month a maximum of 10 entries can be considered for the awards. All selected entries will be awarded a cash prize of Rs. 10,000 each and a certificate.


    To take part in the contest, the participants will have to post their success stories on water conservation through a specially made video of 1-5 minutes (along with a write-up of up to 300 words and some photographs/pictures) depicting the efforts and significant contributions to conserve and manage water resources.


    The participants can share their videos (with the link of their YouTube video) on the MyGov portal (www.mygov.in). In addition to the MyGov portal, the entries can also be submitted at waterheroes.cgwb@gmail.com. The participants are also advised to mention only the YouTube links of their videos in the comments section and not upload the entire video-there. This series of Contest will end on 31 st August 2021.
