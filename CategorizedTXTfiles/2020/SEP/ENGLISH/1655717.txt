    In order to make the shipping industry more attractive and competitive, the Government has taken various measures in recent years. These are reduction in GST from 18% to 5% on bunker fuel used in Indian flag vessels; providing cargo support to Indian shipping industry through Right of First Refusal (RoFR); allowing shipping enterprises based in India to acquire ships abroad and flag them in the country of their convenience; bringing parity in the tax regime of Indian seafarers employed on Indian flag ships vis-à-vis those on foreign flag ships; removal of licensing requirement for chartering of foreign registered ships for encouraging coastal movement of agriculture and other commodities, fertilizers, EXIM laden Transshipment Containers and Empty containers, etc.


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Shipping (I/C) Shri Mansukh Mandaviya in the Lok Sabha today in a written reply.
