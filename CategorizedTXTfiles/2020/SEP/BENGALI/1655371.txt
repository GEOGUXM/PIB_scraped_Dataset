    Swachhta Pledge was administered to all the Railway Officers and Staff as well as the Safaiwalas at their respective offices by maintaining health precautions and social distancing. The staff and officers of SER, passengers and other rail users were encouraged to desist from open defecation as well as the use of plastic bags in areas approaching stations, trains, on tracks, in yards or at home etc.


    A review of Swachhta Pakhwara activities for the remaining period has also been taken. This is not only the involvement of employees and their family members but also an effort to bring about behavioural and attitudinal change of passengers as well as rail users through innovative activities so that the ultimate goal of Swachh Rail-Swachh Bharat vision could be achieved and sustained.
