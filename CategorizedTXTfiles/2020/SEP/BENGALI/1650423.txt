    South Eastern Railway (SER) has taken several initiatives to enhance the railway safety in train operations and other related activities. The improvement in rail safety is a continuous process and SER has taken constant endeavour to improve this. Inspections by officers and safety inspectors have been undertaken at regular intervals on all railway infrastructure with a view to identify weak areas in asset maintenance, safety procedure and systematic defects and to provide ways and means to prevent accidents.


    Besides, periodical safety drives have been launched from time to time to raise safety consciousness amongst staff and to streamline safety aspects including maintenance of assets. Apart from this, safety measures have been undertaken as under:


    (i) Railway tracks replaced through track renewal works which is an ongoing process (ii) Digital machines are being used for testing which are reliable. This digital technology is extensively used in the railway to detect flaws in rails and welded fractures in advance and take remedial steps to avoid accidents (iii) Electronic Interlocking System with Centralised Operation of Points and Signals are being provided to eliminate human errors and to replace old Mechanical System. (iv) Train protection and warning system is a proven technology which has become quite common in the railways (iv) Proliferation of LHB Coaches that have better features. Important mail/express trains of SER are being run with LHB Coaches (v) All unmanned level crossings have been eliminated in SER.


    Moreover, Safety Seminars and discussions are organised on a regular basis for awareness of field officers, supervisors and safety related staff.
