    Skill Acquisition and Knowledge Awareness for Livelihood Promotion (SANKALP) is an outcome based Centrally Sponsored Scheme aimed at implementing the mandate of the National Skill Development Mission (NSDM). SANKALP aims to address the ongoing challenges such as bringing about convergence; infusing quality in skill development programs and making them market relevant and accessible in the context of short-term training.


    SANKALP has three key result areas namely (i) Institutional Strengthening at Central, State and District level; (ii) Quality Assurance of skill development programmes; and (iii) Inclusion of marginalized population in skill development programmes. Unlike other skill development schemes, SANKALP is not a training scheme; it focuses upon interventions in line with the Result Areas as stated above.


    (d) and (e) During the last three years, an amount of Rs 275.02 crore has been sanctioned to 30 States/ UTs, including Gujarat, Bihar and West Bengal, under the SANKALP Scheme. Out of these, Rs 263.32 crore have been released to 28 States/ UTs, as the State Incentive Grants while Rs 11.70 crore have been released to strengthen the skill ecosystem of 117 Aspirational Districts of the 28 States.


    In the eastern region, Bihar has been allocated Rs. 24,76,77,600, as the State Incentive Grant followed by West Bengal. For West Bengal, the amount is Rs 20,70,60,000. As a measure of such livelihood promotion, funds for aspirational districts of West Bengal have been provided Rs. 50,00,000, whereas, for Bihar, the amount is Rs. 1,30,00,000.


    The details of the funds sanctioned to States/ UTs are at Annexure-1.
