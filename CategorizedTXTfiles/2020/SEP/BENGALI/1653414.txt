    The freight loading performance of South Eastern Railway (SER) has increased by 8.72% in August 2020 than the same period, previous year. In the Q-1 of the financial year 2020-21, the freight loading was less by 23.8.8% over Q-1 of financial year 2019-20. However in July 2020, the loading bounced back and became the same as of July 2019. This was stated by General Manager, SER Shri Sanjay Kumar Mohanty in a Press Conference through Web PC today, where representatives of different print and electronic media joined. Shri Mohanty hoped that SER will not only surpass the loading performance of the last fiscal, it will also go beyond the ambitious target set by the Railway Board.


    Shri Mohanty stated that the freight trains have increased their speed also as the average speed of such trains have been raised more than double as compared to the last year. The average speed in August 2020-21 was 44.44 kmph compared to that of 2019-20 when it was 21kmph only.


    It is to be mentioned that, though the regular passenger train services remained suspended during the nationwide lockdown, freight train services continued along with the Parcel Express Trains to maintain the uninterrupted supply of essential commodities to the different corners of the country.
