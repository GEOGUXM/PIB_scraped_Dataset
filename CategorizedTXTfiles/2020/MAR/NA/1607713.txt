    Modernisation of Ordnance Factories has been carried out in the last decade by procurement of state-of-the-art machines, as per the Comprehensive Modernization Plan for the XI th and XII th five-year Plan prepared by OFB, leading to induction of new and modern technologies available globally. To keep pace with the contemporary manufacturing technologies, OFB now prepares an annual investment plan towards modernization of its existing Plant and Machineries and other infrastructure.


    The main technologies which have been upgraded/inducted in the last decade in OFB are cited below:-

      * CNC 5 Axis Machines
      * Laser and Water Jet Cutting Machines
      * Hull Machining Centre
      * Robotic Welding
      * Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS)
      * Cold Swaging
      * Radial Forging Plant
      * Electro-Slag Refining (ESR)
      * Natural Gas (NG) Furnaces
      * Co-ordinate Measuring Machine (CMM)
      * Digitally Controlled Strength Testing Machine
      * HMX Plant
      * Auto-frettage Plant
      * Universal Tensile Testing Machine
      * EDM Wire Cut Machine
      * Heavy Duty Extrusion Press

    OFB has been making sincere endeavour to train and re-skill its employees to meet the requirement of changing environment. The employees of various Ordnance Factories are imparted training on the operation and maintenance of the machines with contemporary indigenous technology being procured against modernization plan of OFB. In addition, OFB has planned for training its suitably qualified Industrial Employees in new digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, internet of things, data analysis and additive manufacturing, which collectively comprise what is referred to as Industry 4.0. OFB is also developing an internal repository of trainers among suitably qualified staff and officers with the help of premier institutions to impart training to Industrial Employees on these technologies. OFB has recently signed an MoU with Directorate General of Training, Ministry of Skill Development And Entrepreneurship , New Delhi on 11.2.2020 for carrying out re-skilling in the selected trades to the level prescribed under National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF).


    The Government has taken a number of steps to strengthen the functioning of OFB, such as:

      * OFB has been delegated with the enhanced financial powers for Revenue and Capital procurement in September, 2016.
      * OFB has been granted Approval-in-Principle by the Government for Capital procurement of Plant and Machinery for up-gradation and modernisation with estimated cost of about Rs. 1727 Crores since September, 2016.
      * To streamline the purchase process of OFB, Procurement Manual - 2018 (Stores Procurement) has been approved and has come into effect from September, 2018.
      * Towards ease of doing business, revised Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for vendor registration by OFB has been formulated in January, 2019, thereby making vendor registration process in OFB simplified and more business friendly.
      * OFB has been geared up to focus on the export market and adequate thrust has been given to export of Arms and Ammunition by way of re-structuring export governance in OFB. To provide flexibility to OFB to bid in export enquiry in a time bound manner, powers have been delegated to Member/OFB (in March, 2019) to bid in export enquiry provided the bidding cost covers the cost of production.
