    The Abhiyaan aims to reduce malnutrition in the country in a phased manner, through a life cycle approach, by adopting a synergised and result oriented approach. There is no separate target for different cities and metros.


    The results of the POSHAN Abhiyaan can be known after the programme has completed its approved period. However, in the meantime, as per the report of Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) conducted by UNICEF, prevalence of stunting and underweight among children is 34.7%and 33.4% respectively, which is an improvement and reduction from the levels reported in National Family Health Survey-4, which were 38.4% and 35.7% respectively.
