      Audit findings


      Taxes on Sales, Trade, etc.


    Audit on “ Assessment of dealers - Builders/Developers under VAT Act ” revealed the following:

      * Cross verification of data in respect of 99 Builders and Developers (B&Ds) obtained from the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai with the Goods and Services Tax Department revealed that 53 B&Ds were not registered with the Department. No surveys had been carried out to identify un-registered B&Ds who had crossed the threshold limit for registration.
      * In one case the deduction on account of cost of land for levy of tax was allowed twice one in 2008-09 ( Rs 15.09 crore) and another in 2009-10 ( Rs 6.77 crore). This had resulted in short raising of demand of Rs 2.99 crore.
      * The Department allowed standard deduction of Rs 15.16 crore on account of labour and service charges instead of Rs 13.43 crore in four cases. This resulted in grant of excess allowance of standard deduction of Rs 1.73 crore involving short levy of tax of Rs 15.47 lakh.
      * Interest for delayed payment of taxes along with returns amounting Rs 4.08 crore was not levied in 17 cases. Further, interest on dues of tax arising after assessment was recovered short by Rs 1.64 crore in 12 cases.

    Audit on “Preparedness for transition to Goods and Services Tax” revealed the following:

      * The Department had made adequate arrangements for training its staff in order to make them familiar with the provisions of Goods and Services Tax Act and the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN). Further, GST campaigns were organised by the Department for making the taxpayers familiar with GST Laws and payment of taxes under the new regime. The Department had also undertaken a review of its organisational structure and cadre of its officers in light of the requirements of GST. Thus, it could be seen that the Department had made good efforts in capacity building both at Departmental and taxpayers level.
      * Out of 107 Application Programme Interface (API) shared for development by GSTN with the State, 65 APIs have been developed and rolled out. The remaining APIs were under different stages of development.
      * The refund module on GSTN was not fully functional and the refund process involved manual intervention. Out of 217 refund cases test checked by audit, in 23 cases final refunds were given within the prescribed period of 60 days, while in the remaining 194 cases the final refunds were granted beyond the prescribed period of 60 days. Refund application numbering 2,069 were pending finalisation as on October 2018.
      * The disposal of assessment cases (15,830) was only five per cent of the total cases (2,98,144) selected for assessment during 2018-19 and 2,82,314 assessment cases were pending for finalisation as on September 2018.
      * An amount of Rs 1,07,576.01 crore pertaining to demands under pre-GST Acts was pending for recovery. Out of this, Rs 8,953.15 crore (eight per cent ) was free from any disputes and was available for recovery, Rs 2,100.99 crore (two per cent ) was pending recovery under Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966, Rs 47,357.61 crore (44 per cent was locked up in appeals with Departmental authorities and Rs 4,058.72 crore (3.77 per cent ) pertained to dealers who were untraceable.

    In the case of one dealer the assessing officer had given credit of a payment received from the dealer amounting to Rs 1.10 crore twice, once as tax and once as interest, which resulted in less raising of demand to that extent.


    Penalty for late filing of Audit Report in form 704 amounting to ` 3.32 crore was not levied in 14 cases.


      Stamp Duty and Registration Fee


    As per recitals of ten documents, consideration of the property (revenue sharing) worked out to Rs 113.97 crore, on which stamp duty of Rs 5.42 crore was leviable against which the department levied Rs 2.59 crore. This resulted in short levy of stamp duty of Rs 2.83 crore.


    The renewal clause extending the lease period was not considered for working out the market value for levy of stamp duty in three lease deeds. This resulted in short levy of stamp duty of Rs 5.20 crore.


      Land Revenue


    In eight cases the unearned income in respect of sale of class-II land was recoverable Rs 21.72 crore against which Rs 7.47 crore was recovered. This resulted in short recovery of Rs 14.25 crore.


    Application of incorrect market value resulted in short levy occupancy price of Rs 1.62 crore.


      Taxes on Vehicles


    Audit on “ Verification of loading restrictions of vehicles at Border Check Posts ” revealed the following:

      * There was huge difference ( 2,68,633) in the number of vehicles (carrying goods beyond the permissible gross laden weight) between the figures furnished by the Department and those furnished by the MBCPNL (through the Transport Commissioner). This resulted in non-recovery of compounding fees/fines of minimum of Rs 81 crore from overloaded vehicles carrying goods beyond permissible limit.
      * There were delays ranging from seven to 19 months in issue of service fee notification, as a result of which the BCPs remained idle till the date of notification.

    Tax amounting to Rs 96.46 lakh was not recovered from the owners of 159 vehicles for the periods ranging from three to 72 months.


      Other Tax and Non-Tax Receipts
