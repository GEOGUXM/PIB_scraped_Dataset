      Additional Travel Advisory (II) for COVID-19 for Indians intending to travel abroad
      Posted On: 11 MAR 2020 10:24AM by PIB Guwahati


    More than 100 countries across the world now have reported cases of COVID19. People traveling to these countries or people who have travelled abroad might come in contact with people affected with COVID-19 during their stay or even while in transit at the airports. Within these countries, few countries have reported very large number of cases and deaths putting passengers from these countries particularly at higher risk of infection.


    In view of the above, Indian citizens are advised:


    i. To avoid non- essential travel abroad.


    ii. They are further strongly advised to refrain from travelling to China, Italy, Iran, Republic of Korea, Japan, France, Spain and Germany.
