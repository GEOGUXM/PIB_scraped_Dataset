    The Animal Welfare Board of India has instructed all State Animal Welfare Boards including West Bengal to evacuate all stranded animals of pet shops through Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCAs). In the wake of lockdown promulgated to snap the strength of Corona virus, such animals kept in pet shops are likely to suffer and die without food, water, temperature control and the like.


    The SPCAs are headed by District Magistrates. Where there is no SPCA available, the District administration should ensure to check and evacuate all animals, if any from all such shops to avoid pain and sufferings to those animals. Necessary directions in this regard is sought after by the Board for all district authorities to check the pets shop in all the localities for searching of animals, if any and evacuate them.
