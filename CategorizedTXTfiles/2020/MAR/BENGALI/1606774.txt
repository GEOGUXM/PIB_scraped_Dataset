    Kolkata, March 17, 2020.


    The Ordnance Factories are observing their 219th foundation day on the March 18 2020. Shri Hari Mohan, Director General of Ordnance Factories and Chairman of Ordnance Factory Board said due to Covid-19 disease all types of programme are cancelled. Today in a press conference held here, he said from the beginning the OFB has evolved into one of the largest defence manufacturing conglomerates in the world with more than 90% of indigenous content and a strong technological and R&D infrastructure.


    The highlight of the previous year, the handing over of "Dhanush" 155 x 42 artillery gun system to the Army, was followed this year by the dedication of the up-gunned version of the 1950s vintage Russian 130mm to 150X45 calibre known as "Sharang" at the recently concluded DEFEXPO at Lucknow. In addition, a number of products such as electronic fuzes, 40mm under Barrel Grenade Launcher Ammunition, the 5.56 X 30 mm Joint Venture Protection Carbine (JVPC) alpha version, the 7.62 X 51 mm belt fed light machine gun (LMG). The OFB is currently developing many critical weapon systems which entail mastery over cutting edge technologies.


    In the field of artillery, the twin successes of "Dhanush" and "Sharang" have been followed by the development of the 155 X 52 mounted gun system (MGS) which is undergoing internal validation trials. Another significant achievement is the successful trial of 155 X 52 barrels.


    Another significant achievement is the development of the Commander Thermal Imaging (Tl) sights for T-72 and T-90 tanks, thereby enhancing the night fighting capability of these tanks.


    A majority of the R&D work being carried out by the Ordnance Factories is in collaboration with the DRDO and premium institutes such as the IITs. OFB has entered into an agreement with IIT Madras to develop Center of Excellence for ammunition at IIT Chennai which will power the development of futuristic ammunition such as precision guided ammunition. OFB has also entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the CSIR for advanced research.
