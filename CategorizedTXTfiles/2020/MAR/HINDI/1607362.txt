The claim benefits are provided by LIC directly into the bank account of beneficiaries through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT).


    The Ministry of Textiles also regularly organizes awareness programmes and camps through its Weaversâ€™ Service Centres to facilitate enrolment of handloom weavers/workers under Government Flagship Insurance Schemes.
