    As per Swachhata Status Report 2016, published by National Sample Survey Office, 93.9% of the rural households having toilet had access to water for use in toilets. Under SBM(G), the incentive for individual household toilet was increased from Rs.10,000 to Rs.12,000 to provide for water availability including storage for hand-washing and cleaning. Under SBM (G), rural pans are used which uses only 1-2 liters of water for flushing. The Government has also launched Jal Jeevan Mission recently which aims at providing Functional Household Tap Connection to every rural household.
