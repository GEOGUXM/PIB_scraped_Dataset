    Ahmedabad, Sunday, 01 Mar 2020

    A team of 49 Sanginis led by Mrs. Nirmala Ghotia, President, Air Force Wives Welfare Association (Regional), South Western Air Command participated in PINKATHON 2020 held at River Front, Ahmedabad. These women of steel represented true 'Shakti (power)' of Indian Air Force and their 'Never Quit' attitude. I never quit, I never give up, I push myself and turn my pain into lifetime gain, a sangini (airwarrior's wife) said. Under the supervision, guidance and motivation from President AFWWA (R), Vayusanginis participated in all categories, including President herself leading from the front. HQ SWAC makes continuous efforts to keep the Air Warriors and their families fit by organising various events under Fit India Movement. Constant practice led to this huge participation with smiling faces, truly keeping them in pink of their health. These cheerful sanginis say, 'stay healthy, stay pink'.
