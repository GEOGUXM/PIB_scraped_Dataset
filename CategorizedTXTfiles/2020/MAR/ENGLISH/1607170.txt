      Posted On: 19 MAR 2020 5:20PM by PIB Delhi


    Law and Order being a State subject, initiatives/actions on closing down unused bore-wells in the Country is primarily States’ responsibility.


    Further, Hon’ble Supreme Court has laid down stringent safety guidelines for suitable preventive actions to avoid unattended bore-wells vide their Orders dated 11 Feb 2010 and 06 Aug 2010.


    In addition, Ministry has also advised the States/UTs for strict implementation of laid down safety guidelines as issued by Hon’ble Supreme Court.


    Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has been constituted under Section 3(3) of the ‘Environment (Protection) Act, 1986’ for the purpose of regulation and control of ground water development and management in the Country. CGWA grants ‘No Objection Certificates’ (NOC) for ground water abstraction in 23 States/UTs through guidelines which are modified from time to time.


    Further, 20,078 applications (from 23 States/UTs being regulated by CGWA) have been received by CGWA for grant of ‘No Objection Certificate’ (NOC) to abstract ground water during the period 15.03.2018 to 16.03.2020.


    In Andhra Pradesh, the ground water regulation is being done by the State Government except for Mining projects which is done by CGWA. In addition, during the last two years, only 2 applications have been received by CGWA for grant of NOC to abstract ground water in the State of Andhra Pradesh for Mining Projects.
