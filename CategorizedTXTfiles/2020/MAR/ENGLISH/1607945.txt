    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:

         1. Crude oil production by ONGC during February, 2020 was 1672.96 TMT which is 4.64% higher when compared with February,2019 but 11.95% lower than the target for the month. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-February, 2019-20 was 18848.84 TMT which is 6.10%and 2.21% lower than target for the period andproduction during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

      * Non realization of production from WO-16 cluster due to unavailability of MOPU.

      * ESP issues in wells of NBP and Ratnafields.
      * Less production from B-127 Cluster due to increase in water cut.
      * Increase in water cut in certain wells of Mumbai High,Heera, Neelam& B173A fields

         1. Crude oil production by OIL during February, 2020 was240.26 TMT which is 13.13% lower than the monthly target and 1.41% lower than the February, 2019. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-February, 2019-20 was 2852.55 TMT which is 8.88% and 5.39% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * Less than planned contribution from workover and drilling wells.

      * Less than planned contribution from Old well- Rise in water cut in wells & Decline in total liquid production of wells as a consequential effect of the wells shut-in during bandhs.

         1. Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during February,2020 was 486.29 TMT which islower by 31.90% than the monthly target and 32.58%lowerthanFebruary, 2019.Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-February, 2019-20 was 7770.46 TMT which is 10.72% and 14.23% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively.Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * RJ-ON-90/1: Shut down during 5 th to 29 th February, 2020 for major plant maintenance activities. (CEIL)

         1. Natural gas production by ONGC during February, 2020 was 1869.97MMSCM which is 14.38% lower than target and 4.29% lower when compared with February 2019. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC duringApril-February, 2019-20 was 21841.29 MMSCM which is 7.01% and 3.10% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively.Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * Less Gas production from Vasistha/S1 wells in EOA due sand incursion issues and from DDW No. 5 in HPHT Asset.

      * Non-realization of gas production planned from WO16 cluster from Dec’19 in absence of MOPU
      * Less than planned gas production from Bassein field and Daman Tapti Block.
      * Less gas production due to less gas off take by Consumers, including major customers.

         1. Natural gas production by OIL during February, 2020 was 200.79 MMSCM which is 16.18% lower than monthly target and 1.43% lower than February, 2019. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-February, 2019-20 was 2456.64 MMSCM which is 19.13% and 1.21% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * Production restricted due to continuation of low upliftment by BVFCL (unscheduled plant shutdown at unit II & III)

      * Gas supply to LTPS suspended due to intelligent pigging workof Namrup to Lakwa gas pipe line.
      * Consequential loss due to effect of bandh/blockades

         1. Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during February,2020 was 269.76 MMSCM which is 32.02% lowerthan monthly target and33.93% lower than February, 2019. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-February, 2019 was 4471.49MMSCM which is 9.47% and 11.12% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * Sohagpur West: Dewatering wells gas breakout awaited, slow gas ramp up in pilot wells & scaling in producing wells. (RIL)

      * Raniganj East: Production reduced due to limited off take by customers and to avoid flaring. (ESSAR)
      * AAP-ON-94/1: Production shortfall due low consumer demand. (HOEC)
      * KG-OSN-2001/3: Production from well D5 is less than anticipated. D5 well is under observation and stabilization. (ONGC)
     1. Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)

    Refinery production during February, 2020 was 21118.17TMT which is 2.45% higher than the target for the month and5.15% higherwhen compared with February, 2019. Cumulative production during April-February, 2019-20 was233182.24 TMT which is0.71% higher than the target for the period but0.65% lower than production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III . Company-wise production for the month of February, 2020 and cumulatively for the period April-February, 2019-20vis-à-Vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

    Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production


         1. CPSE Refineries’ production during February, 2020 was 12168.69TMT which is 3.62% lower than the target for the month and1.92%higherwhen compared with February, 2019.Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-February, 2019-20 was 132454.12TMT which is 1.36% and 4.17% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively.Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


      * IOCL-Guwahati and Bongaigaon: Shutdown deferment.

      * IOCL- Haldia: Lower due to CDU-1 Start-up delay.
      * IOCL- Panipat: Lower due to AVU (Atmospheric and Vaccum Distillation Unit) shutdown for maintenance job
      * CPCL-Manali: Lower due to CDU-1 outage emergency shutdown.
      * NRL- Numaligarh: As per crude availability

    3.2 Production in JV refineries during February, 2020 was 1680.43TMT which is 13.08% lower than the target for the month and2.32% higher when compared with February, 2019. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-February, 2019-20 was 18456.91 TMT which is 7.51% and 12.60% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively..


    3.3 Production in private refineries during February, 2020 was 7269.05TMT which is 11.81% higher than the target as well as corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-February, 2019-20 was 82271.22 TMT which is 2.72% higher than the target as well as corresponding period of last year.


    3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of February, 2020 and cumulatively for the period April-February, 2019-20vis-à-vis April-February,2018-19 are given at Annexures -IV and V respectively.
