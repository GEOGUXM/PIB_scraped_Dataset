    In order to provide social security benefits to the workers in the unorganised sector the Government has enacted the Unorganised Workersâ€™ Social Security Act, 2008. This Act stipulates formulation of suitable welfare schemes for unorganised workers on matters relating to: (i) life and disability cover, (ii) health and maternity benefits, (iii) old age protection and (iv) any other benefit as may be determined by the Central Government. Life and disability cover is provided through Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) to the unorganised workers depending upon their eligibility. Ministry of Labour and Employment has been implementing the Converged Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BimaYojana (PMSBY), since June 2017 to provide life and disability coverage to the unorganised workers depending upon their eligibility. Converged PMJJBY gives coverage of Rs.2 lakhs on death at premium of Rs.330/- per annum for an age span from 18 to 50 years. Converged PMSBY gives coverage of Rs.2 lakhs on accidental death and disability at premium of Rs.12 per annum covering an age span from 18 years to 70 years. These converged schemes are being implemented by Life Insurance Corporation of India. The annual premium is shared on 50:50 basis by the Central Government and the State Governments. The new enrolment shall only be done under converged PMJJBY/PMSBY. The number of beneficiaries enrolled under this Scheme, are as follows:

    For old age protection in the form of monthly pension, Ministry of Labour & Employment in 2019 has launched Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-dhanYojana which is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme for providing monthly minimum assured pension of Rs. 3000/- on attaining the age of 60 years. The unorganised workers in the age group of 18-40 years whose monthly income is Rs.15000/- or less and not a member of EPFO/ESIC/NPS(GOVT. FUNDED) can join the scheme. Under the scheme, 50% monthly contribution is payable by the beneficiary and equal matching contribution is paid by the Central Government. The total number of enrolments under this Scheme so far are 42,06,439.


    Government has approved a proposal for creation of a National Database of unorganized workers (NDUW). This database shall be seeded with Aadhar and accessible through Aadhar number. This database will be used for delivering social security schemes implemented by Central and State Governments.


    A draft code on Social Security 2019 has been prepared by amalgamating simplifying and rationalizing the relevant provisions of the existing Nine Central Labour Acts relating to social security for organised and unorganised sector workers.
