    As per National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP) of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the estimated number of incidence of cancer cases reported in the country during the three years is given below:

Estimated Incidence of cancer cases  14,51,417  15,17,426  15,86,571
                                                                    
                                                                    

    Health is a State subject and the Central Government supplements the efforts of the State Governments in preventing and controlling cancer. The objectives of National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), being implemented by Central Government under National Health Mission (NHM) for interventions upto the district level, includes awareness generation for cancer prevention, screening, early detection and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment. For cancer, the focus is on three cancers, namely breast, cervical and oral. A population level initiative for prevention, control and screening for common Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) i.e. diabetes, hypertension and common cancers viz. oral, breast and cervical cancer, has been rolled out in over 215 districts of the country, as a part of comprehensive primary healthcare. Screening of common NCDs including three common cancers i.e. oral, breast and cervical is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres.Cancer is diagnosed and treated at various levels in the health care system. In Government hospitals, treatment is either free or highly subsidized. Treatment of cancers is also available under Ayushman Bharat - PradhanMantri Jan ArogyaYojana (PMJAY). Besides this, Affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment (AMRIT) Deendayal outlets have been opened at 203 Institutions/Hospitals with an objective to make available drugs and implants at discounted prices to the patients. Under the umbrella scheme of RashtriyaArogyaNidhi, financial assistance is provided to families living below threshold poverty line for their treatment, including treatment of cancer, in Government hospitals.


    Scientific Institutions/Departments such as Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) , Department of Biotechnology and Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR)support research in various filed including treatment of cancer. SreeChitraTirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST), Kerala, has developed a technology to make Curcumin, an active ingredient in Turmeric with anti cancer properties, water soluble by binding it with human albumin. This research was supported by ICMR. More studies are however needed to get regulatory nod.


    To enhance the facilities for tertiary care of cancer, the Central Government is implementing Strengthening of Tertiary Care for Cancer Scheme, under which setting up of 19 State Cancer Institutes (SCI) and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres (TCCC) have been approved. The list of such approved SCIs and TCCCs in the country including in the State of Kerala, is given below:

    Further, Oncology is also one of the focus areas in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under PradhanMantriSwasthyaSurakshaYojana (PMSSY). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar in Haryana and strengthening of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, are also steps in the same direction.
