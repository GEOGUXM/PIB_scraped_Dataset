      Posted On: 12 MAR 2020 2:22PM by PIB Delhi


    As per extant instructions, upto a maximum of 5% of direct recruitment vacancies arising in a year in Group ‘C’ posts can be filled up by compassionate appointment. There is no fixed quota of posts to be filled up annually on compassionate grounds, as compassionate appointments are to be made by the administrative Ministries/Departments as per the general policy guidelines laid by the Department of Personnel and Training subject to availability of vacancies, number of applicants seeking compassionate appointment etc.


    A person selected for appointment on compassionate grounds is to be adjusted in the reservation roster against the appropriate category, viz. a candidate belonging to SC/ST/OBC/General category would occupy the position allocated to the respective category, in the roster.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
