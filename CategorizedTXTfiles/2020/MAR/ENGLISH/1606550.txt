      CNG Stations
      Posted On: 16 MAR 2020 3:33PM by PIB Delhi


    Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) is the authority to grant authorization to the entities for development of City Gas Distribution (CGD) network in Geographical Areas (GAs) as per PNGRB Act, 2006. Establishment of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Stations is a part of development of CGD Network and the same is carried out by the entities authorized by PNGRB based on techno-commercial viability. So far, PNGRB has authorized 230 Geographical Areas (GAs) for development of CGD Network across the country which covers around 71% of Indiaâ€™s population and 53% of its area. Remaining areas of the country will be covered for development of CGD network in future bidding rounds subject to techno-commercial viability, natural gas pipelines connectivity and natural gas availability. PNGRB has also informed that no CNG stations are operational in the state of Tamil Nadu. As on 01.02.2020, 1989 CNG stations are operational in the country including Assam, Delhi NCR and Chandigarh. Details of CNG Stations are at Annexure I . Further, as per minimum work programme, the authorized CGD entities have committed to set up CNG Stations across the country including the states of Assam, Tamil Nadu and Jaipur.


    This information was given by the Union Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas Shri Dharmendra Pradhan in the Lok Sabha today in a written reply.
