    The Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD), Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has urged the Ministry of Home Affairs to ensure minimum support services to Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) during the lockdown period.


    In a letter to the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, the Secretary, DEPwD has written that Persons with Disabilities are very vulnerable in situations of risk. They need continuous care and support owing to their disability. Many of them are dependent on caretakers, maids and other support service providers in their daily activity/living. DEPwD has been receiving several calls from various quarters regarding hardship being faced by Persons with Disabilities during lockdown period as their maids/caregivers are finding it difficult to reach their homes during this period. While there is no denying fact that social distancing norms are followed to the hilt, but at the same time it is the responsibility of the Government to take measures to ensure their access to essential support services, given the severe restrictions imposed on the movement of people.


    It is urged in the letter for issuance of instructions to law enforcement authorities in the States/UTs to take immediate steps to issue passes to the caregivers/maids of Persons with Disabilities on priority basis. If need be, assistance of District officials dealing with Divyangjan may be sought for quick verification. The local police may also be advised to give wide publicity in their locality to elicit request of Persons with Disabilities without delay.
