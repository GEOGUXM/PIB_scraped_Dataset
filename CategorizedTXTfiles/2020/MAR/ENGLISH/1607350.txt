      Posted On: 20 MAR 2020 4:29PM by PIB Delhi


    The Consumer Protection Act,1986 was enacted to provide for better protection of the rights of consumers. Under the provisions of the said Act, a three tier quasi-judicial machinery, called Consumer Fora, has been established at the District. State and National level to provide simple, inexpensive and speedy redressal to consumer disputes. To further improve the consumer protection legislation, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 has recently been enacted, which on coming into operation will replace the existing Consumer Protection Act of 1986. The new Act provides for several measures for simplification of the adjudication process in the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions such as deemed admissibility of complaints if not admitted within twenty-one days, e-filing, videos conferencing for hearing and the provision of Mediation,etc.
    
    Under the provisions of Consumer Protection Act, 2019, Central Govt. is empowered to frame rules to prevent unfair trade practices in e-commerce.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution , Shri Ramvilas Paswan, in Rajya Sabha today.
