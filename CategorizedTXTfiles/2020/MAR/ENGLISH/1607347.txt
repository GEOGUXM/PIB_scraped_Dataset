      Fall in production of sugar
      Posted On: 20 MAR 2020 4:27PM by PIB Delhi


    In the current sugar season 2019-20(October-September), the sugar mills in the country has produced about 213 Lakh Metric Tonnes (LMT) of sugar till 17.03.2020, as against 242 LMT in the corresponding period of previous sugar season.


    During first three months of the current sugar season, the sugar production was about 79 LMT as against 112 LMT achieved during corresponding period of last sugar season 2018-19.


    The decline in sugar production is due to fall in production of sugarcane mainly in the major sugar producing states of Maharashtra and Karnataka, due to drought in some parts and heavy rains & floods in some other parts of these states.
    
    In view of sufficient availability of sugar in the country, the sugar prices in the domestic market are stable which helped the sugar mills to clear the cane price dues of farmers at a steady rate. The average ex-mill prices of sugar during current sugar season are in the range of Rs 3150 to Rs 3350 per quintal. The cane price payment is an ongoing process. As on 17.03.2020, the cane price payable, paid & arrear position for sugar season 2017-18, 2018-19 and current sugar season 2019-20 is as under:-
