    Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh said that at present, two (02) major schemes are being implemented in North Eastern States by North Eastern Council (NEC). These are:

     1. Schemes of the NEC;
     2. North East Road Sector Development Scheme ( NERSDS)

    Replying to a question in the Rajya Sabha today, he said that under these schemes at present 548 of projects are at various Stages of implementation. The State Component of outlay of NEC under “Schemes of NEC” is divided between NER States based on normative allocation percentage decided based on area, population, human development index, road density, percentage of census villages electrified, number of hospital beds per 1000 persons, percentage of households having safe drinking water and completion rate of projects.


    Government accords very high priority to holistic development of North Eastern Region. All the central Ministries/Departments are mandated to spend 10% of their gross budgetary allocation on Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes in the North Eastern States. In the financial year 2019-20, Rs. 53,370 crore has been provided under Revised Estimates which is being used for infrastructure and socio and economic development of North Eastern Region. The normative allocation criterion takes care of poorest/most backward amongst North Eastern States and allocates more funds to that State.
