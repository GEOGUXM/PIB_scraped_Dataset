      Biomethanation of rice straw to solve stubble burning
      Posted On: 03 MAR 2020 3:10PM by PIB Delhi


    The following steps are being taken to solve the problem of stubble burning, namely:-


    1. In an all India coordinated project, efforts are on to produce bio-gas for kitchen use and quality manure for fields using bio-methanation of rice straw by anaerobic digestion method. Six domestic level paddy straw based bio-gas plants have been installed in Punjab for field trials and further study is in progress.


    2. R&D project has been supported on refinement and demonstration of an integrated process technology for conversion of crop residues into ethanol and methane for use as transport fuels.


    3. A major focus on agriculture waste/stubble management (waste to wealth), alternative to burning, has been taken up under waste management technologies programme and proposals are being considered.


    This was stated by Minister of Science and Technology, Health and Family Welfare, and Earth Sciences, Dr. Harsh Vardhan in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
