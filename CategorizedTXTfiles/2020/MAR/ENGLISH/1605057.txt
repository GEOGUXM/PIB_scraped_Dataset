      Posted On: 03 MAR 2020 8:23PM by PIB Delhi


    Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) is already implementing a Crop Diversification Programme (CDP) for replacing paddy crop with less water consuming alternative crops to save water and protect soil in the state of Punjab.


    State-wise allocation (central share) under CDP for replacing paddy / tobacco crops during 2019-20 is given below:

    Crop Diversification Programme (CDP), a sub scheme of RashtriyaKrishiVikasYojana (RKVY) is being implemented in Original Green Revolution States to divert the area of paddy crop to alternate crops and in tobacco growing states to encourage tobacco farmers to shift to alternate crops/cropping system. Under CDP for replacing paddy crop, assistance is provided for four major interventions viz., alternate crop demonstrations, farm mechanization & value addition, site-specific activities &contingency for awareness, training, monitoring, etc. However, for replacing tobacco crop, tobacco growing states have been given flexibility to take suitable activities/interventions for growing alternative agricultural/horticultural crops.


    Government of India also provide flexibility to the states for state specific needs/priorities under RKVY. The state can promote crop diversification under RKVY with the approval of State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) headed by Chief Secretary of the State.
