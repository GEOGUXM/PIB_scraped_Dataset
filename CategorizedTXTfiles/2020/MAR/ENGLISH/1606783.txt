    (i) where such adulterant is not injurious to health, to a penalty not exceeding two lakh rupees;


    (ii) where such adulterant is injurious to health, to a penalty not exceeding ten lakh rupees.


    The Act is implemented by Food Safety and Standard Authority of India (FSSAI) through the State Food Commissioners in each State.


    Further, this Department under National Programme for Dairy Development (NPDD) has provided milk testing equipments for testing of microbiological and chemicals parameters of milk & milk products including adulterants to 231 dairy plants in Cooperative sector with total outlay of Rs. 271.64 crore during current financial year.
