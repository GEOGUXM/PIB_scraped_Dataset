    As per the information received from Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Department of Food & Public Distribution, the Centrally Sponsored Pilot Scheme on “Fortification of Rice and its Distribution under Public Distribution System (PDS)” has been approved for a period of three years beginning 2019-20 with a total budget outlay of Rs.174.64 Crore.
    
    The Pilot Scheme is funded by Government of India in the ratio of 90:10 in respect of North Eastern, Hilly and Island States and 75:25 in respect of the rest of the States. The Pilot Scheme focuses on 15 districts, preferably 1 district per State. The decentralized model of fortification by States/UTs has been approved in the Pilot Scheme with blending at the rice milling stage. The operational responsibilities and identification of the districts for implementation of the Pilot Scheme lie with the States/UTs. States/UTs have been requested to operationalize blending of fortified rice at milling stage and start its distribution through PDS as early as possible.


    So far, 15 States, i.e., Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh have consented for implementation of the Pilot Scheme. Out of these States, Maharashtra and Gujarat have already started distribution of fortified rice under PDS in the Pilot Scheme from February, 2020.
