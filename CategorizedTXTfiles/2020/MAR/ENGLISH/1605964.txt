    In order to arrest the brain drain and make the career of Scientists in DRDO more lucrative, the following incentives are given to Scientists in DRDO:-


    Financial Incentives:

      * Professional Update Allowance : Scientist ‘B’, ‘C’ & ‘D’ are granted Rs 22,500 p.a., Scientists ‘E’ & ‘F’ Rs 45,000/- p.a. and Scientists ‘G’ and above Rs 67,500 p.a. as Professional Update Allowance.
      * Additional Increments : There was a provision of two additional increments for the Scientists C, D, E & F at Level 11, 12, 13 & 13A respectively in the Pay Matrix in 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) terms. However, as of now the same have been stopped by PCDA. A case has been taken up by this HQ with CGDA to resume the payment of two additional increments.
      * Variable Increments : Up to six increments are granted to deserving Scientists at the time of promotion under Flexible Complementing Scheme (FCS) based promotion scheme on the basis of the performance of the Scientists in Assessment Board.
      * Special Pay : A special pay of Rs 2000 (5th CPC)/Rs 4000 (6th CPC) was granted to Scientists ‘G’ in lieu of higher pay scale through Cabinet sanction. The grant of special pay has been discontinued in 7th CPC as part of list of allowances recommended for abolition.

    Career Growth related incentives :

      * DRDO follows the Merit based Flexible Complementing Scheme (FCS) for Defence Research Development Services (DRDS) Cadre, where promotions are based purely on merit without any linkage to availability of vacancies or seniority. The merit is assessed by the duly constituted Assessment Board for the purpose. Under the FCS, Scientist recruited at the level of Sc ‘B’ in the feeder grade of Gp ‘A’ can move up to the level of scientist ‘H’ in Level 15 Higher Administrative Grade (HAG) scale and thereafter, the level of Distinguished Scientist in the Level 16 (HAG + scale), which is achievable on personal up-gradation basis.

    DRDO has conventional parity with Deptt. of Atomic Energy (DAE) & Deptt. of Space (DOS). The Incentives upto 06 Variable increments to Scientists, Professional Update Allowance are applicable to all the three organizations and derive their authority from the common letters issued by Ministry of Finance for three strategic departments.


    DRDO has been requesting for PRIS (O)-Organizational (20%) and PRIS (G)-Group (10%) two components of Performance Related Incentive Scheme (PRIS) available to other strategic scientific organizations namely DAE and DOS, but not to DRDO.
