      Posted On: 18 MAR 2020 4:23PM by PIB Delhi


    By virtue of Entry 9 and 41 of State List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, the respective States are required to implement the provisions relating to reservation for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) in their establishments. As such, there is no proposal to launch a Special Recruitment Drive for filling up the vacancies for PwDs in consultation with State Governments.


    As per data obtained from various Central Government Ministries/ Departments which also include vacancies in Central Public Sector Undertakings, Nationalised Banks and Financial Institutions, etc, of the 15000 vacancies for PwDs identified in 2015, a total of 14263 have since been filled up. These vacancies, inter alia , included backlog vacancies carried forward from earlier years. State-wise data for filling up of vacancies for PwDs is not maintained by Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT). However, DoPT regularly reviews the positions with the Departments/ Ministries of Government of India for expeditious action to fill up the vacancies.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to questions in Lok Sabha today.
