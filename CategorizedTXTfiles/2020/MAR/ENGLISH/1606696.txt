    The government has partially achieved these targets and following strategies have been adopted for achieving the target:

     1. To increase notification of TB cases from the private sector – Enforcement of gazette on mandatory TB notification and Schedule H1 notification, Incentives to private providers, expansion of Patient Provider Support Agencies (PPSAs) through domestic resources, engagement with Indian Medical Association and Indian Academy of Pediatrics
     2. To provide free anti-TB drugs for TB patients in private sector - programme has actively pursued to advocate with private clinics to prescribe free drugs, the supply chain system is being strengthened with support of the field level staff in the States/ UTs and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) at many places and inventory management system - NIKSHAY Aushadhi is deployed.
     3. For payment of Direct Benefit Transfer incentives to treatment supporters and private providers – scheme has been operationalized in Nikshay portal and process has been streamlined. Regular review meetings are conducted to monitor the disbursement of DBT payments.
     4. Establishment of Patient Provider Support Agencies (PPSAs) at district level – expansion of Patient Provider Support Agencies (PPSAs) through domestic resources, Technical Support Unit in 9 high priority states to strengthen state’s capacity for contracting agencies and private sector engagement 98% of TB patients were initiated on injection free regimen during 2019. Access to Bedaquiline (>18 yrs age group) & Delamanid (6 to 18 yrs age group) is already expanded to all states for patients both in public & private sector.
