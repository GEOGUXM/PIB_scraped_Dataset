    To improve the financial security of ASHAs, the Government of India has already taken several steps in addition to routine and recurring incentives, which inter-alia includes :


      * Benefits of Life insurance, accident insurance and pension to eligible ASHAs and ASHA facilitators are extended by enrolling them under:


      * PradhanMantriJeevanJyotiBeemaYojana (premium of Rs. 330 contributed by GOI).


      * PradhanMantriSurakshaBeemaYojana (premium of Rs. 12 contributed by GOI).


      * PradhanMantriShram Yogi MaanDhan (PM-SYM) (50% contribution of premium by GOI and 50% by beneficiaries).


      * The government has also approved a cash award of Rs. 20,000/- and a citation to ASHAs who leave the programme after working as ASHAs for minimum of 10 years, as acknowledgement of their contribution.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
