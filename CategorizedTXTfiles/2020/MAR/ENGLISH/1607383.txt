      Posted On: 20 MAR 2020 5:40PM by PIB Delhi


    Indian Railways has a well-established system for registering manual complaints (offline grievances) in Complaint Registers at stations and in trains. In 2015, Indian Railways launched CoMS (Complaint Management System) for redressing online grievances. Complainants could register complaints in CoMS via Web, APP or SMS.


    With a view to merge all online and offline channels of grievances into a unique single platform, RailMadad was launched in June 2018. RailMadad converges online modes of grievances like Web, APP, SMS, Phone & Social Media, and also provides option for uploading offline complaints. Integrated RailMadad Helpline 139 integrates all erstwhile Railway Helplines (except 182), and provides railway passengers the comfort of a single Helplines for inquiry, assistance and grievances.


    RailMadad has an inbuilt system for monitoring time and quality of redressal. All complaints coming in RailMadad are automatically routed to the concerned field staff for faster redressal. The system also provides for in-depth MIS reports which enable Railway managers to do root-cause analysis for taking system improvement measure. Due to its unique features, RailMadad has been awarded ‘Silver’ in the category “Excellence in providing citizen-centric delivery” in the National e-Governance awards 2019-20.


    This press release is based on information given by the Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
