      Posted On: 13 MAR 2020 5:19PM by PIB Delhi


    In pursuant of announcement in Union Budget 2019-20, Government of India has approved a Central Sector Scheme titled "Formation and Promotion of Farmer Produce Organizations (FPOs)" to form and promote 10,000 new FPOs.
    
    Under the scheme, a total number of 2000 FPOs have been proposed to be formed in 2020-21. No state-wise target has been decided as the FPOs will be formed based on justified produce clusters. Under the scheme, it will be ensured that adequate support is extended to States of North East and hilly areas to offset deficiency in specialized manpower and expertise available in such areas. The minimum members per FPO in case of plain areas will be 300; while in North-Eastern and Hilly Region, it will be 100.
    
    This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar, in Rajya Sabha today.
