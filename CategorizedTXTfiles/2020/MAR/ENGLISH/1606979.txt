      Posted On: 18 MAR 2020 6:08PM by PIB Delhi


    Railways is giving a big thrust to infrastructure creation and capacity augmentation. Railway Projects are taken up on the basis of remunerativeness, last mile connectivity, missing links and alternate routes, augmentation of congested/saturated lines, socio-economic considerations etc. depending upon throwforward of ongoing projects, overall availability of funds and competing demands and sanctioning of projects is a continuous process.


    Railway Projects are sanctioned Zone-wise and not State-wise, as, Indian Railway’s network is straddled across various State boundaries.
