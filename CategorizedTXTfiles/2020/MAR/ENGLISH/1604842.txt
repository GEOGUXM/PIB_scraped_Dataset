      Posted On: 02 MAR 2020 3:58PM by PIB Delhi


    In pursuance to the Union Budget announcement (2018-19), it has been decided to set up two Defence Industrial Corridors in the Country, one in Uttar Pradesh and another in Tamil Nadu. Subsequently, five nodes for Tamil Nadu Defence Industrial Corridor, viz. Chennai, Coimbatore, Hosur, Salem and Tiruchirapalli have been identified. Investments of approximately Rs. 3100 crore were announced by Ordnance Factory Board (OFB)/Defence Public Sector Undertaking (DPSUs) & Private Industries in Tamil Nadu Corridor.


    Till date, six consultation meetings of stakeholders in Tamil Nadu were organized across its various nodes. Further, Government has also appointed a consultant for the preparation of Detailed Project Report for these two Defence Corridors.


    Setting up of Tamil Nadu Defence Industrial Corridor would catalyse indigenous production of defence and aerospace related items, thereby reducing our reliance on imports and promoting export of these items to other countries. This will lead to generation of direct & indirect employment opportunities and growth of private domestic manufacturers including Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and start-ups.


    This information was given by Raksha Rajya Mantri Shri Shripad Naik in a written reply to Shri P. Wilson in Rajya Sabha today.
