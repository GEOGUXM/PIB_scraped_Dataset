    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, in his message on the eve of World Tuberculosis Day, which is observed every year on March 24, has said:-


    “I am happy to learn that World Tuberculosis Day is being observed on 24th March, 2020 to commemorate the anniversary of Dr. Robert Koch’s discovery of the Tuberculosis (TB) bacteria in 1882.


    Government of India has committed to eliminate prevalence of TB by 2025, with commensurate resources to rapidly reduce TB incidence prevalence and mortality in India. I appreciate the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare for implementing the National Strategic Plan (NSP) for Tuberculosis Elimination (2017-2025). The Ministry deserves to be complemented for working tirelessly to improve quality of treatment and to create comprehensive support systems for TB patients.


    On this occasion, I appeal to all the stakeholders to come together to reinforce the efforts in "TB Harega Desh Jeetega Campaign" and to ensure that this campaign becomes truly a people's movement”.
