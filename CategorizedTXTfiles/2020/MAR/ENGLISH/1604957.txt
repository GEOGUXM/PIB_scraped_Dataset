    The target envisaged in National Health Policy, 2017 for relative reduction in prevalence of current tobacco use is 30% by 2025. The National Health Policy 2017 of the Government of India identifies coordinated action on ‘Addressing tobacco, alcohol and substance abuse’ as one of the seven priority areas as outlined for improving the environment for health. Accordingly, Nasha Mukti Abhiyan Task Force (including tobacco, alcohol and substance abuse) was constituted with to formulate a detailed ‘Preventive and Promotive Care Strategy’ for addressing tobacco, alcohol and substance abuse (Nasha Mukti Abhiyan). Pursuant to its first meeting, three Working Groups viz. Working Group on Preventive Aspects; Regulatory Mechanisms; and Curative Aspects to formulate strategy for Nasha Mukti Abhiyan were constituted. The Working Group on Regulatory Mechanisms has the mandate to explore the existing provisions of the concerned laws/schemes and to analyse whether any amendment is required in the existing provision/scheme. The recommendations of the Working Group for redrafting/modifying the existing provisions of COTPA are awaited.


    Further, Inter-Ministerial Committee for prevention and control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) has been constituted in this Ministry to facilitate implementation of actions required for prevention and control of NCDs as outlined in National Multisectorial Action Plan (NMAP). The NCD Committee does not work on legal reforms.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
