    Evaluation Studies of Pre-Matric, Post Matric and Merit-cum-Means based Scholarship schemes have been carried out by an independent agency- M/s Research & Development Initiative in 2013-14. It observed that the Pre-Matric Scholarship Scheme has been able to achieve its objectives to a large extent as it has reached the most deprived in the minorities; raised their demand for school education; reduced the financial burden of poor parents; enabled most children to stay through school education; and improve their performance levels. The Post Matric Scholarship scheme has been also able to achieve its objectives to a large extent as it has reached the most deprived in the minorities; raised their demand for higher secondary and higher education; somewhat reduced the financial burden of poor parents; enabled a large proportion of beneficiaries to stay through their course/higher education; improved their performance levels. These perceived impacts of the Post-matric Scholarship Scheme are statistically significant. Similarly, the Merit-cum-Means based Scholarship scheme has been able to achieve its objectives by reaching the most deprived in the minorities; raised their demand for technical and professional education; somewhat reduced the financial burden of poor parents; enabled a large proportion of beneficiaries to stay through their technical/professional course; improved their performance levels. It has also observed that these schemes have contributed significantly towards the long term objective of empowering the minorities through education.


    The aforesaid three Scholarship Schemes for Minorities are proposed for continuation beyond 2019-20. As such, all aspects, including raising the number and amount of scholarships or otherwise are to be looked into by this Ministry during the process of approval of these schemes for such period.
