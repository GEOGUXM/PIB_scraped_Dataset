      Posted On: 13 MAR 2020 5:11PM by PIB Delhi


    Since the launch of Make in India programme, FDI inflow during the period April 2014 to December 2019 has been USD 335.33 billion which is nearly 51% of cumulative FDI in India since April 2000. In 2018-19, FDI inflow stood at a record of USD 62 billion, highest ever recorded for a fiscal year ever. The financial year wise FDI Inflow and FDI Equity inflow is placed at Annexure I. The state-wise details of FDI Equity inflow are maintained w.e.f. October, 2019 and placed at Annexure II.


    Make in Indiaâ€™ is not a scheme rather an initiative which was launched on September, 2014 with the objective of facilitating investment, fostering innovation, building best class manufacturing infrastructure, making it easy to do business and enhancing skill development. The initiative is further aimed at creating a conducive environment for investment, modern and efficient infrastructure, opening up new sectors for foreign investment and forging a partnership between government and industry through positive mindset.


    Make in India initiative has made significant achievements and presently focuses on 27 sectors under Make in India 2.0. The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade is coordinating action plans for 15 manufacturing sectors, while Department of Commerce is coordinating action plans for 12 service sectors.


    At the same time, investment promotion and facilitation activities under the Make in India initiative are being undertaken by several Central Government Ministries/ Departments and various State Governments from time to time. The data about total number of manufacturing units set up is therefore not maintained centrally. Further, Ministries formulate action plans, programmes, schemes and policies for the sectors being dealt by them. This Department does not maintain information on such formulations by the line ministries.
