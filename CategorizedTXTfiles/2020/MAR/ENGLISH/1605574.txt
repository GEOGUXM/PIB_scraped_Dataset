      Posted On: 06 MAR 2020 5:32PM by PIB Delhi


    The One Stop Centre (OSC) Scheme is approved since 1 st April, 2015 by Government of India under Nirbhaya Fund to be set up across the country for women affected by violence. The OSC scheme aims to facilitate women affected by violence with a range of integrated services under one roof including police facilitation, medical aid, psychological counselling, legal support and temporary shelter. Under the OSC Scheme, 100% funds are disbursed to districts for setting up and running of OSCs. Till date 728 OSCs have been approved by Government of India in 724 districts. Out of these, 680 OSCs are operational and have addressed more than 2.5 lakh cases of women.


    To upgrade the quality of OSCs, training and capacity building initiatives are undertaken for OSC functionaries through various trainings and capacity building programmes at the National, Regional and State levels. Further, monitoring of OSC is undertaken from time to time at various levels through visits, review meetings, video conferences, inspection reports etc. An online tool of Sakhi Dashboard has also been developed by Government of India for capturing data about OSCs regarding details of cases as well as the facilities and services provided to violence affected women coming to OSCs.


    The total fund released under OSC Scheme during the year 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 is Rs.229.61 crore, total utilisation of fund is Rs.61.34 crore and total unutilized fund is Rs.168.27 crore. The States/UTs and district authorities undertake the implementation of OSC Scheme. Government of India undertakes review meetings with the officers of State Government through video conferencing and meetings from time to time at various levels for proper implementation of the scheme.


    In Gujarat 33 OSCs have been approved by Government of India in 33 districts which have been operationalised by the State.
