      * Plan to sanction additional 637 Girls Cadet Instructors (GCIs) over a period of 5 years is under implementation.
      * Additional vacancies have been catered for in both the Officer Training Academies (OTAs), i.e., OTA Kamptee and OTA Gwalior, to the tune of 575 vacancies and 130 vacancies respectively, to ensure better training output for ANOs (Male and Female).
      * Orientation Training Course (PIOC) of all the military posted Permanent Instructor (PI) staff is ensured within first three months of the tenure by respective NCC State Directorates/Group Headquarters.
      * At institute levels, following issues are being regularly ensured:
