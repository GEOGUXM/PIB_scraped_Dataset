    The above table reveals that India’s merchandise export has increased from 275.85 US$ billion in 2016-17 to 303.53 US$ billion in 2017-18 and to 330.07 US$ billion in 2018-19, registering a positive growth of 10.03% and 8.75% as compared to the previous years. Excluding Petroleum Products and Gems &Jewellery, India’s merchandise export has increased from 200.89 US$ billion in 2016-17 to 224.51 US$ billion in 2017-18 and to 243.27 US$ billion in 2018-19, registering a positive growth of 11.77 % and 8.75% as compared to the previous years and there is 0.01% positive growth during the current year(April 2019 to January 2020). The month-wise and region-wise merchandise export for the current year (April 2019 to January 2020) is at Annexure-I .


    In order to boost India’s exports and increase foreign exchange, some of the steps taken by Government are as follows:


    (i) A new Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2015-20 was launched on 1st April 2015. The policy, inter alia, rationalised the earlier export promotion schemes and introduced two new schemes, namely ‘Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS)’ for improving export of goods and ‘Services Exports from India Scheme (SEIS)’ for increasing exports of services. Duty credit scrips issued under these schemes were made fully transferable.


    (ii) Based on Mid-term Review of the FTP 2015-20 undertaken on 5th December, 2017, incentives for labour intensive / MSME sectors were increased by 2%.


    (iii) A new Logistics Division was created in the Department of Commerce for integrated development of the logistics sector. India’s rank in World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index moved up from 54 in 2014 to 44 in 2018.


    (iv) Interest Equalization Scheme on pre and post shipment rupee export credit was introduced from 1.4.2015 providing interest equalisation at 3% for labour intensive / MSME sectors. The rate was increased to 5% for MSME sectors with effect from 2.11.2018 and merchant exporters were covered under the scheme with effect from 2.1.2019.


    (v) For improving ease of doing business, online issuance of Importer Exporter Codes (IEC), has been started. India’s rank in World Bank ‘Ease of Doing Business’ ranking improved from 142 in 2014 to 63 in 2019 with the rank in ‘trading across borders’ moving up from 122 to 80.


    (vi) A new scheme called “Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES)” was launched with effect from 1st April 2017 to address the export infrastructure gaps in the country.


    (vii) A comprehensive “Agriculture Export Policy” was launched on 6th December, 2018 with an aim to double farmers’ income by 2022 and provide an impetus to agricultural exports.


    (viii) A new scheme called “Transport and Marketing Assistance” (TMA) has been launched for mitigating disadvantage of higher cost of transportation for export of specified agriculture products.
