      Posted On: 03 MAR 2020 6:39PM by PIB Delhi


    Stand Up India Scheme was launched by the Government on 5 th April 2016 and the Scheme facilitates bank loans between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore to at least one Scheduled Caste/ Scheduled Tribe borrower and at least one woman borrower per bank branch of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) for setting up greenfield enterprises in the manufacturing, services or the trading sectors. This was stated by Shri Anurag Singh Thakur, Union Minister of State for Finance & Corporate Affairs, in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.


    Shri Thakur further said that the Scheme is expected to benefit at least 2.5 lakh borrowers. Government does not allocate funds for loans under the Stand Up India Scheme as loans under the Scheme are extended by lending institutions as per commercial parameters. However, state-wise and bank-wise details of loans extended under the Scheme, as on 25 th February 2020, are placed at the Annexure-I and Annexure-II respectively.
