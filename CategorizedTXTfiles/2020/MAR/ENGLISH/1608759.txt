    Braving the threat of COVID-19, the Border Roads Organsation (BRO) personnel are working relentlessly to completely replace Daporijo bridge (430 feet Multi Span Bailey Brigde), the only lifeline of Upper Subansiri district, Arunachal Pradesh to restore Lines of Communication for all 451 villages and Security Forces located along the China border. The personnel of 23 BRTF/Project Arunank, on special request from Local Administration, is working in full swing in spite of the dilapidated state of existing bridge. A BRO statement said it is committed with the resolve of opening this vital line of communication by planned date, with all necessary precautionary measures.


    Meanwhile, in the Northern Part of the country, BRO is presently engaged in Snow clearance operations on Manali - Leh axis, day and night despite inclement weather and COVID 19 threat to provide relief to Lahaul valley and Ladakh in an earlier time frame. Presently Rohtang Pass and Baralachala Pass is being addressed by four snow clearance teams. This is the first time, BRO personnel were inducted by air to Sarchu to carry out snow clearance of mighty Baralachala Pass from Sarchu side.


    The Border Roads Organisation, an important arm of the Ministry of Defence, plays pivotal role in constructing and maintaining operational road infrastructure in inhospitable and far flung border areas to support the armed forces meet their strategic needs.
