      Posted On: 26 MAR 2020 12:04PM by PIB Delhi


    Shri Anand Kumar, the secretary MNRE ( Ministry of New & Renewable Energy) , has stated in a tweet that all Renewable Energy projects under implementation will be given extension of time considering period of lock down and time required for remobilisation of work force.


    Indian Prime Minsiter, announced a complete lockdown across the country for 21 days from Tuesday midnight, asserting that it was "very necessary to break the chain of coronavirus." The spread of coronavirus has not only disrupted the supply chain of components used in RE projects but also has impacted the availability of workforce. In this context the announcement of the extension of time will provide great relief to all the stakeholders in RE sector.
