    The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today asked the Railway Ministry to expedite the creation of passenger amenities and the introduction of passenger services between Krishnapatnam and Rapur Railway Stations on Obulavaripalli-Krishnapatnam rail line in Andhra Pradesh.


    During a meeting with the Union Minister of State of Railways, Shri Suresh Angadi at Uparastrapati Bhavan, today, Shri Naidu enquired about the progress of the passenger services and provision of passenger amenities on the above-mentioned routes.

    The Railway officials present at the meeting explained to the Vice President that the Ministry of Railways was negotiating with KRCL for amending the concession agreement.
