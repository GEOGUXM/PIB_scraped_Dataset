    In compliance of orders of Hon’ble Supreme Court of India and as recommended by committee of experts constituted at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), instructions have been issued to provide a Medical Box containing life saving medicines, equipments, oxygen cylinder etc. at all Railway stations and passenger carrying trains. Front line staff i.e. Train Ticket Examiner, Train Superintendents, Assistant Station Master etc. are trained in rendering First Aid. Regular refresher courses are conducted for such staff. List of near-by hospitals and doctors along with their contact numbers is available at all Railway Stations. Ambulance services of Railways, State Government/Private Hospitals and ambulance service providers are utilized to transport the injured/sick passengers to the hospitals/doctor’s clinics.


    In the Railway Budget 2016-17, Mission Zero Accident was one of the Missions announced, comprising of the two sub-missions:

     1. Elimination of unmanned level crossings (UMLC) over broad gauge in the next 3-4 years.
     2. Train Collision Avoidance System (TCAS): To prevent collisions and signal passing at danger by the Loco Pilot through developing an indigenous technology and also to increase throughput by increasing average sectional speed on Indian Railways (IR).

    Current Status of the implementation of two sub-missions under Mission Zero Accident is as follows:

         1. Elimination of Unmanned Level Crossings: All unmanned level crossings (UMLC) on Broad Gauge have already been eliminated in January 2019.
         2. Train Collision Avoidance System (TCAS): Train Collision Avoidance System is an indigenous Automatic Train protection (ATP) system developed in association with Indian manufacturers. The system has been installed on Lingampalli – Vikarabad – Wadi and Vikarabad – Bidar sections (250 Route km) on South Central Railway. Further, the system is under implementation on 1199 Route Km on South Central Railway.

    In order to make Railways efficient and safe, all staff including safety category staff are required to undergo structured training at all Training Institutes of Indian Railways on regular basis as per prescribed periodicity at various stages of their career. Safety category staff is also given training in Disaster Management with emphasis on Relief, Rescue and Rehabilitation (three ‘R’s), Threat Perception and Emergency Response, Fighting and use of fire Extinguishers and First Aid. Railway Training Institutes are allocated fund on annual basis for development of infrastructure, development of training modules/training materials, conduct of training programmes etc.
