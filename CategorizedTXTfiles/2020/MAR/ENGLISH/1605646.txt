    On the occasion of International Women’s Day, the Union Minister of State for Culture & Tourism (Independent Charge), Shri Prahlad Singh Patel has announced that All ASI protected ticketed Monuments including Taj Mahal will be free for all women visitors from India and across the world. Shri Patel said that India has a great tradition to give respect to women and we believe that wherever women are given their due respect, even the deities like to reside there and where they are not respected, all actions remain unfruitful.


    He further said that it is a small tribute from Ministry of Culture to the women power of the world. He also said that Archaeological Survey of India is fully committed towards safety and security of women visiting its monuments. He said that in this direction a Baby care & Feeding Room was inaugurated by him at the premises of Taj Mahal in Agra, Uttar Pradesh on 29 th August 2019 and after that the same has been set up at various monuments across India.
