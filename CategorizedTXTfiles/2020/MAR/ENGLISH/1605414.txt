    Under Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) [SBM(G)], all the 6,03,175 villages in the country have declared themselves Open Defecation Free (ODF) as on 2.10.2019. The Government has further advised all the States to ensure that no one is left behind under SBM(G) and to identify the missed out rural households, if any, and support them to construct toilets under the programme.


    Under SBM(G), 10.24 crore individual household latrines (IHHLs) were constructed from 2.10.2014 to 31.12.2019.


    The Government has approved Phase-II of SBM(G) for the period from 2020-21 to 2024-25, with the focus on ODF sustainability by providing access to toilets facilities to the newly emerging eligible rural households of the country and Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) in the villages.
