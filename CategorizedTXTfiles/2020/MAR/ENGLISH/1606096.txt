    Cleaning of river is a continuous process and Government of India is supplementing the efforts of the State Governments in addressing the challenges of pollution of rivers by providing financial and technical assistance. Under the National River Conservation Plan (NRCP), project proposals are received from the State Government from time to time for taking up pollution abatement works in towns along various rivers, and are considered for financial assistance on a cost sharing basis subject to their conformity with the scheme guidelines, pollution status, prioritizations, appraisal by independent institutions and availability of Plan funds. The NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches of 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the country with a sanctioned cost of Rs.5870.54 crore. A Central share of Rs.2510.63crore has been released to the State Governments for implementation of various pollution abatement schemes. A sewage treatment capacity (STP) of 2522.03 mld (million litres per day) has been created under the NRCP resulting in reduction in pollution load being discharged into various rivers.
