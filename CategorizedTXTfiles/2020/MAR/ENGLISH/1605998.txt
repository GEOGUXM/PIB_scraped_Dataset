    Sufficient funds have been provided to the ongoing Railway projects.


    Average Annual Budget allotment in New Line, Doubling and Gauge Conversion Projects during 2014-19 has increased to Rs.26,026 crore from Rs.11,527 crore during 2009-14, which is 126% more as compared to average allotment during 2009-14. Total Budget allotment in New Line, Doubling and Gauge Conversion Projects has increased to Rs.38,803 crore in 2019-20 from Rs.11,527 crore during 2009-14, which is 237% more as compared to average annual budget allotment during 2009-14.


    Based on operational requirement, thorough review of throughput enhancement projects has been carried out and with focused approach, the projects have been prioritized into Super Critical Projects (58 nos) and Critical Projects (68 nos.).


    As on 01.04.2019, the balance length of Super Critical Projects is 2347 Km and 5676 Km of Critical Projects. All out sincere and focused approach is being adopted by Railway for quick execution and early return to Railways.


    To achieve the above objective, and for fast pace execution of projects, New Paradigm shift has taken place in planning of projects, so that, available resources are utilized judiciously for optimum results. Thus, the funds have been allotted in focused manner, so as to achieve value for money and to benefit the Nation.


    To complete the Super Critical & Critical capacity enhancement projects in time bound manner, around Rs.4,300 crore have been proposed for Super Critical projects, around Rs.8,300 crore for Critical projects and around `9,100 crore for other Doubling projects.


    Hence, the money has been proposed to the projects which are in advance stage of completion, important new line National Projects, executable & Important Gauge Conversion projects and the projects which are important from the throughput enhancement considerations. Thus, the focused attention is given in proposed fund allotment, rather than thinly spreading the resources without fruitful results.


    The project-wise detail including cost, expenditure and outlay are available in public domain on Indian Railways’ website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in >Ministry of Railways >Railway Board >About Indian Railways >Railway Board Directorates >Finance (Budget)>Railway-wise Works Machinery & Rolling Stock Programme > Regular Budget (year).


    The completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions of working agencies/contractors etc. and all these factors vary from project to project and site to site and affect completion of the projects. Hence, no confirmed time frame can be fixed for completion of projects.


    In the overall interest of the nation and to ensure that projects are completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, divisional level, zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues that are obstructing the progress of projects.


    To ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects.


    For capacity enhancement projects, institutional financing has been arranged, which has increased Railways’ capacity for committed fund provision for capacity enhancement projects.


    This press release is based on information given by the Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
