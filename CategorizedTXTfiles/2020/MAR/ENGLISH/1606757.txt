    Department of Pharmaceuticals has a sub-scheme viz. Assistance to Medical Device Industry for Common Facility Center under the umbrella scheme for Development of Pharmaceuticals Industry. Under this sub-scheme, financial assistance to the tune of Rs.25 Crore or 70% of the project cost, whichever is less is provided for creation of common facilities under any upcoming Medical Device Park promoted by State Governments/State Corporations. Department has received four proposals seeking financial assistance under this sub-scheme from the State Governmets of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The “in-principle” approval has been given to proposals received from State Governments of Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu while “final approval” has been given to proposal received from Andhra Pradesh.


    Under the above sub-scheme, Department has accorded “final approval” for financial assistance of Rs.25 Crore to the project of State Government of Andhra Pradesh for setting up of Common Facility Centre for Superconducting Magnetic Coil. However, no financial assistance has so far been disbursed. The objective is to incease the competitiveness, easy access to standard testing facilities and value addition in the domestic Medical Device Industry through creation of such common world class facilities in a Medical Device Park.


    This information was given in a written reply by Minister for Chemicals & fertilizers, Shri. D.V. Sadananda Gowda in Lok Sabha today.
