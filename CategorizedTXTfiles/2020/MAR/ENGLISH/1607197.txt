    MONITORING OF WELFARE SCHEMES FOR MINORITIES


    The monitoring of the implementation of various welfare schemes is being done through different mechanism and also by outside agencies from time to time to ensure their effectiveness and efficiency. Some of these measures are as under:-

              o UCs / Physical Report
              o Third Party Study/Monitoring
              o District / State Level Committee
              o Empowered Committee
              o Field Visit by Inspecting Officers of the Ministry and State Governments
              o Regional Coordination Meetings

    As and when such instances are reported or come to the notice of the Government, necessary action is taken as per extant guidelines and rules.
