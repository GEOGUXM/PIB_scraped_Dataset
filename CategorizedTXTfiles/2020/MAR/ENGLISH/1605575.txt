      Posted On: 06 MAR 2020 5:33PM by PIB Delhi


    In order to address the micronutrient deficiencies among preschool children across the country including marginalized groups living in tribal, rural and remote areas across the country including Andhra Pradesh, the Government is taking following measures:


    Supplementary Nutrition is provided under the Anganwadi Services Scheme in order to bridge the gap between the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) and Average Dietary Intake (ADI). The Supplementary Nutrition is provided in the form of Hot Cooked Meal, Morning Snack and Micronutrient Fortified Food and/or Energy-dense Food as Take Home Ration (THR). States/UTs have been advised to use fortified food items under the Supplementary Nutrition Programme.


    Government has also emphasized the importance of dietary diversification to address micronutrient deficiencies through the use of fresh local fruits and vegetables depending on the local food habits. In this context, States/UTs have also been advised to promote Nutrition Garden/Kitchen Garden in the premises of AnganwadiCenters to help ensure regular supply of fresh fruits and vegetables rich in micronutrients like Iron, Vitamin-C, for inclusion in supplementary nutrition and improve the nutritional status of Anganwadi Services beneficiaries.


    States/UTs have also been advised to include Millets (nutri-cereals / coarse grains like Jowar, Bajra, Ragi) in the recipes to enhance the nutritional quality of meals provided under Supplementary Nutrition Programme.


    This information was given by Minister for Women and Child Development, SmritiZubinIrani, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
