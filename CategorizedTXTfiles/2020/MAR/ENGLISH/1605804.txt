    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind in his message on the eve of Holi has said:-


    “On the occasion of the festival of Holi, I convey my greetings to fellow citizens in India and abroad.


    The Festival of Colours signals the end of winter and the advent of spring. As the harbinger of hope, it has a special place in our cultural calendar. Its celebrations across the country are marked by a rare vivacity across generations. Holi, with its myriad colours, is also the best reflection of our diversity and multicultural heritage.
