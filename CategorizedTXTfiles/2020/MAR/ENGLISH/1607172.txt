      Posted On: 19 MAR 2020 5:23PM by PIB Delhi


    Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) is implementing National Aquifer Mapping and Management program (NAQUIM), which envisages mapping of aquifers (water bearing formations), their characterization and development of Aquifer Management Plans to facilitate sustainable management of Ground Water Resources. Out of the nearly 25 lakh km 2 of mappable area in the country, so far aquifer maps and management plans have been developed for an area of 11.8 lakh km 2 covering various parts of the country.


    Aquifer mapping across the country is being undertaken on assessment unit (Block/Taluka/Mandal/Firkka) level and out of 6881 assessment units, nearly 3600 assessment units have been covered by CGWB.


    CGWB collects ground water data, which is available in public domain and can be accessed through the web-site of CGWB. All persons/institutions/organisations including GPs can use this data for ground water management.


    This information was given by the Union Minister of State for Jal Shakti & Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Rattan Lal Kataria in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
