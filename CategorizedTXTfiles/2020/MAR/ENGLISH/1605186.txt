      Posted On: 04 MAR 2020 5:10PM by PIB Delhi


    The India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), established by the Department of Commerce, promotes and creates awareness in international market about Indian products and services through branding campaigns. Branding campaigns have been undertaken by IBEF around international events for select export sectors to highlight their strength and achievements in major target markets through branding modes like venues, advertising through outdoor and print, media interaction, digital marketing (including social media), use of branding material etc. The branding strategy is reviewed regularly in consultation with concerned stakeholders to make suitable adjustment and maximise benefits for Indian products.


    Based on the proposals submitted by the Export Promotion Councils/ Trade Promotion Organizations, an annual plan for organizing participation of exporters in various international fairs and expos is drawn and supported under the Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme. No targets of earnings from such events are fixed .


    This information was given by the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
