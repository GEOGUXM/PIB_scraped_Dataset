    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has saluted the spirit of 'Nari Shakti' on International Women's Day.


    "Greetings on International Women’s Day! We salute the spirit and accomplishments of our Nari Shakti. As I’d said a few days ago, I’m signing off. Through the day, seven women achievers will share their life journeys and perhaps interact with you through my social media accounts", the Prime Minister said.


    India has outstanding women achievers in all parts of the nation. These women have done great work in a wide range of sectors. Their struggles and aspirations motivate millions. Let us keep celebrating the achievements of such women and learning from them. #SheInspiresUs

    I always dreamt of reviving the traditional crafts of Kashmir because this is a means to empower local women.
    
    I saw the condition of women artisans and so I began working to revise Namda craft.
