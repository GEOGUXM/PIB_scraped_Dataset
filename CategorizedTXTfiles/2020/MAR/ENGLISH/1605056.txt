    Most of the countries are signatory to the Cartagena Protocol on Bio-safety which has well defined mechanism of regulation of Genetically Modified (GM) crops including bio-safety evaluation and environmental release. Further, acceptance of GM crops has increased at global level and area under GM crops increased from 1.7 Million hectare in 1996 to 191.7 Million hectares in 2018.


    The aim of Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) is to achieve the goal of food security and nutritional requirements for a growing population by using best available technology and scientific inputs that are beneficial to farmers and safe for environment & human health.


    Bt. cotton is the only GM crop approved by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) in 2002 for commercial cultivation in the country. Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change informed that they have received feedback from multiple stakeholders for and against release of GM brinjal and GM mustard. The feedback was suitably considered by the GEAC, which has advised additional studies to be conducted for assessment of impact on environment and health.
