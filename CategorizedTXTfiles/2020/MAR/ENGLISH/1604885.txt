    The University Grants Commission (UGC) has developed life skills (Jeevan Kaushal) curriculum for undergraduate students at Universities and Colleges. This Curriculum covers the courses on communication skills, professional skills, leadership & management skills and universal human values. The life skills curriculum is available at https://www.ugc.ac.in/e-book/SKILL%20ENG/mobile/index.html .


    The Jeevan Kaushal curriculum is suggestive. The UGC has requested Vice-Chancellors of all Universities to consider the curriculum for introduction in Universities and affiliated Colleges/institutions at under-graduate level.


    The objectives of the Jeevan Kaushal curriculum are:


    (i) to enhance one’s ability to be fully self aware by helping oneself to overcome all fears and insecurities and to grow fully from inside out and outside in;


    (ii) to increase one’s knowledge and awareness of emotional competency and emotional intelligence at place of study/work;


    (iii) to provide opportunity for realising one’s potential through practical experience;


    (iv) to develop interpersonal skills and adopt good leadership behaviour for empowerment of self and others;


    (v) to set appropriate goals, manage stress and time effectively; and


    (vi) to manage competency-mix at all levels for achieving excellence with ethics.


    The information was given by the Union Minister for Human Resource Development, Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
