    PHWR – Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor LWR – Light Water Reactor FBR – Fast Breeder Reactor


    The Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) are fuelled by Natural Uranium while Light Water Reactors (LWRs) are fuelled by Low Enriched Uranium. The annual requirement of fuel (UO 2 ) of a 700 MW PHWR (at 85% Capacity Factor) is about 125 tons and that of a 1000 MW LWR (at a capacity factor of 90%), about 25 tons. Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) being implemented by Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam Limited (BHAVINI) is fuelled by Mixed Oxide (MoX) Fuel.
