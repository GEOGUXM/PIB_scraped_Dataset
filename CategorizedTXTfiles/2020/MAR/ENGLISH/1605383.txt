      * The provision of Prevention and Containment of Pollution of the sea by oil is covered under Chapter XIA of Merchant Shipping Act, 1958. This provision is applicable to all ships registered under this Act and compliance is monitored and regulated by the Directorate General of Shipping (DGS).

      * The Rules developed by Central Government under the Power granted by Section 356E of Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 is to deal with pollution of seas from ship-generated pollution sources.


      * Ships are subjected to initial inspection once they are constructed to ensure that the ship is fitted with all necessary equipment to prevent pollution of seas. Once the ship is put into operation, it is subjected to periodical inspections at regular intervals, annually, to verify whether the pollution prevention equipment are in order and that the vessel is in compliance with all applicable rules and regulations for prevention of pollution.


      * Surprise inspections are also conducted by Surveyors stationed at various Mercantile Marine Department on Indian and Foreign Flag vessels through powers granted under Section 356G [Power of Surveyor to board a ship (Indian or Foreign) to verify compliance to rules made under Section 356 E] of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958.


      * The ships contravening the requirements are detained until the non-compliances are rectified and a detention fees is imposed.


      * To prevent ships contravening the Regulatory requirements for operational necessity, Section 356 I in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 to enable ports to provide reception facilities at ports in order to receive ship generated wastes.


      * The DGS as a proactive measure and also being custodian of Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 has developed a centralized online portal called “SwachhSagar” for request and provisioning of waste reception facilities.


      * To reduce pollution of air by sulphur oxide, MARPOL Annex VI (Prevention of Air Pollution) has been amended and now requires that from 1 January 2020 Sulphur content of fuel used on board ships should not exceed 0.5% mass/mass.
