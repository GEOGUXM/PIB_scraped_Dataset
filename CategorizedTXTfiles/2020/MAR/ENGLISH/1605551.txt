      Posted On: 06 MAR 2020 4:33PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government has enhanced honorarium of AWWs fromRs3,000/- to Rs. 4,500/- per month; AWWs at mini-AWCs from 2,250/- to 3,500/- per month; AWHs from Rs. 1,500/- to Rs. 2,250/- per month from 1 st October, 2018. The Government has also introduced performance linked incentive of Rs. 250/- per month to AWHs effective from 1 st October, 2018. AWWs are paid performance linked incentive of Rs. 500/- per month for using ICDS-CAS (Common Application Software) under POSHAN Abhiyaan. Most of the States/UTs are also giving monetary incentives to these workers out of their own resources. AWWs/AWHs are honorary workers who come forward to render their services on payment of monthly honorarium. In view of the very nature of the role of Anganwadi Workers/Helpers, it is not feasible to declare them as regular/permanent employees.


    Under Anganwadi Services Scheme, funds are provided for up-gradation of AWC buildings at the rate of Rs.2.00 lakh per AWC building, for Maintenance Rs. 3,000/- per AWC and for Furniture & Equipment Rs. 10,000/- per AWC and Rs. 7,000/- per Mini-AWC once in 5 years. Funds for upgradation of AWC building, Maintenance, Furniture & Equipment are released to States/UTs. Apart from this, funds for construction of toilets in AWCs and for providing drinking water facilities in AWCs are also released to States/UTs. Upgradation and improvement of basic infrastructural facilities is provided for in the Scheme.
