    More than 1.5 crore COVID samples (1,54,28,170) have been tested, till now. In the last 24 hours 3,52,801 samples have been tested for COVID-19 identification.


    This translates to 11179.83 tests per million (TPM) for India, which has seen a steady increase since the adoption of this strategy.


    The rise in TPM has been achieved with a steady rise in the number of labs (1290 so far), and efforts by the Centre and State/UT governments to facilitate wide-spread testing through an array of options.


    The RT-PCR labs are the backbone of the latest testing strategy prescribed by ICMR. The number of labs in the public and private sectors are seeing a progressive enhancement. There are 897 labs in the government sector and 393 private labs. The details are as follows:


    • Real-Time RT PCR based testing labs: 653 (Govt: 399 + Private: 254)


    • TrueNat based testing labs: 530 (Govt: 466 + Private: 64)


    • CBNAAT based testing labs: 107 (Govt: 32 + Private: 75)
