      Posted On: 08 JUL 2020 12:52PM by PIB Delhi


    Till now unmarried permanently disabled and financially dependent sons of ECHS beneficiaries after attaining the age of 25 years are not considered dependant and hence are not eligible for availing medical facilities under Ex-servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS). This is as per the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) Rules which are followed by ECHS. However, vide their OM No 4-24/96-C&P/CGHS(P)/EHS dated January 1, 2020, the CGHS has declared such sons of CGHS beneficiaries who have become disabled after attaining the age of 25 years, dependant and hence eligible for availing CGHS benefits subject to fulfilment of conditions laid down in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) Office Memorandum (OM) No 4-24/96-C&P/CGHS(P)/EHS dated May 5, 2018.


    It has now been decided by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare (DESW) to similarly treat unmarried permanently disabled and financially dependent sons of ECHS beneficiaries who have become disabled after attaining the age of 25 years as dependant and hence eligible for availing benefits under ECHS subject to fulfilment of conditions laid down in the MoHFW OM of May 7, 2018.
