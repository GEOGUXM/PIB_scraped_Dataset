    Shri Patel said that this announcement is a small step to promote Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s Atam Nirbhar Bharat initiative. Shri Patel also urged film industry to shoot in less popular ASI monuments along with known ones, so that world can get information about those monuments as well. At the same time, the Union Minister also requested to do more shooting in North-Eastern India and Himalayan states so that the country and the world will get to know more about their natural beauty and vibrant culture.
