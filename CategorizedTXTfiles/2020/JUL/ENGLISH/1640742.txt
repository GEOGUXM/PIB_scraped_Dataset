    An off patent anti-viral drug Favipiravir, originally discovered by Fuji, Japan has shown promise in clinical trials for treatment of Covid-19 patients, especially the mild and the moderate patients.


    CSIR constituent lab CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT) has developed a cost effective process using locally available chemicalsto synthesize this Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) and transferred the technology to leading pharmaceutical industry M/s Cipla Limited.


    Cipla has scaled up the process in their manufacturing facility and approached DCGI for permission to launch the product in India. Given that DCGI has given restricted emergency use for Favipiravir in the country, Cipla is now all set to launch the product to help patients suffering from Covid-19.


    Commenting on the development, Director CSIR-IICR, Dr S Chandrashekhar said that the technology provided by CSIR-IICT is very efficient and makes it affordable and allows Cipla to make large quantities of the product within a short span of time.


    DG-CSIR, Dr Shekhar C Mande observed that CSIR is working with industry in developing quick solutions and products for mitigation of Covid-19 and this partnership with Cipla is an example of how CSIR is committed in bringing repurposed drugs on a fast track.
