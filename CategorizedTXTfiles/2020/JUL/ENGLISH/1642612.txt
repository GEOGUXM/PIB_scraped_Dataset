      Posted On: 31 JUL 2020 6:14PM by PIB Delhi


    The government of India is looking to have a distinct identity for 'AatmaNirbhar Bharat Abhiyan' by developing a logo based on creative and innovative inputs from the citizens of the country through the 'AatmaNirbhar Bharat Logo Design Contest' held on MyGov.in. The last date of submission of entries is 5th August2020 till 11.45 PM. The winning logo will be awarded a cash prize of Rs. 25,000/-.


    MyGov is a citizen engagement platform launched by PM Narendra Modi to promote the active participation of Indian citizens in the Nationâ€™s governance and development. MyGov has crowdsourced many logos of various departments and initiatives like Swachh Bharat, DekhoApnaDesh, Lokpal and many more.


    Under the Prime Minister's vision of AatmaNirbhar Bharat, India has demonstrated how it rises up to the challenges it faces and uncovers opportunities presented before it. India has faced the COVID- 19 situation with fortitude and a spirit of self-reliance, that is evident in the fact that from zero production of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) before March 2020 , India today has created a capacity of producing 2 lakh PPE kits daily, which is also growing steadily.


    Additionally, India has demonstrated how it rises up to challenges and uncovers opportunities therein, as manifested in the re-purposing of various automobile sector industries to collaborate in the making of life-saving ventilators.
