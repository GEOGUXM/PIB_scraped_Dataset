    Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has prepared a blue print for implementing the scheme of cashless treatment of motor accident victims, as contemplated under the MV Act 2019. This includes treatment of victims during the crucial Golden hour.


    The ministry has written to principal secretaries and secretaries in charge of transport in all States and union territories soliciting their views on concept note of the cheme by the 10th of this month. The scheme also includes creation of a Motor Vehicle Accident Fund.


    The National Health Authority being the nodal agency for PM-JAY and having footfall across the country with over 21,000 hospitals on board has been entrusted to implement the scheme.


    It has been envisaged in the scheme to provide compulsory insurance cover to all Road users in the country. The Fund would be utilised for treatment of road accident victims and for payment of compensation to the injured or to the family of person losing life in hit and run cases. The proposed modalities of the scheme have been designed in a way that they allow access to quality care at the right time for all individuals, irrespective of their capability to pay.
