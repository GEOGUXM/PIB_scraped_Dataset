    The National Council for Science & Technology Communication (NCSTC) and Vigyan Prasar, an autonomous institute of Department of Science and Technology (DST) organised two webinars earlier this week on “Popular Science Writing” for capacity building of research scholars under Augmenting Writing Skills for Articulating Research (AWSAR) programme to create a brigade of science communicators.


    Scholars from 28 States and Union Territories across the country and also from 12 other countries USA, Germany, United Kingdom, Israel, etc. were introduced to the importance of communicating science, writing popular articles from research and to tips and techniques of popular science writing.


    Dr. Manoj Patairiya, Head NCSTC, DST and Dr B.K. Tyagi, Scientist F, VigyanPrasar addressed the audience and shared tips on science communication. The webinars received huge response with a total 1282 registered participants from India and abroad.


    “Writing of a popular science story based on one's research does wonders in enhancing our own understanding of how the deep and narrow of my knowledge relates to the broader questions of science and the needs of society. I have found that if I can explain my research to people across ages and educational backgrounds in a manner that engenders understanding, appreciation, and even some excitement, then I have understood the many dimensions of the problem better myself!,” said Prof Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, DST.
