    CPI-IW: Food and General Indices


    Speaking about CPI-IW for June, 2020 Shri Santosh Gangwar, Minister of State (I/C) for Labour and Employment the increase in CPI-IW will have a positive effect on wages/salaries of industrial workers engaged in organized sector. He added that the moderation in annual inflation is mainly due to fall in prices witnessed in Pulses & products, Milk & products and Condiments & Spices.


    Shri DPS Negi, Director General of Labour Bureau while releasing the index said “The rise in index is a positive but definitive indication of revival of economy to pre-corona period due to increased consumption expenditure.”
