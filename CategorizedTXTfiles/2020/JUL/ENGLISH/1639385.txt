    The “Test, Track and Treat” strategy of the Centre being implemented by the State/UT governments is proving to be an appropriate strategy to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. India has seen a steady increase in the number of patients recovering of COVID. In the last 24 hours, 22,942 were cured and discharged.This has resulted in 63.33% of total positive cases recovering. 6,35,756 patients have recovered, till date.


    While the strategy to deal with the spread of infection remains focused on early detection with wide-spread and easily accessible testing, the intensive contact tracing is aimed at restricting the spread. The Containment Strategy implemented across the Containment and Buffer Zones stresses on house-to-house survey and surveillance of SARI/ILI patients with focus on the elderly and people with co-morbid conditions. This has ensured that the COVID cases are identified in a timely manner and treated as per the severity of the symptoms either at home or in hospitals.


    Ramping up of testing capacity has resulted in more than 3 lakh tests being conducted per day. 3,33,228 samples have been tested in the last 24 hours. The cumulative number of 1,30,72,718 samples tested has resulted in 9473 testing per million for the country.


    Starting from one diagnostic lab in Jan 2020, the country is strengthened 1244 labs today, with 880 labs in the government sector and 364 in the private sector.


    • Real-Time RT PCR based testing labs: 638 (Govt: 392 + Private: 246)


    • TrueNat based testing labs: 504 (Govt: 452 + Private: 52)
