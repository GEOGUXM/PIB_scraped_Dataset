    The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has wished the people on the auspicious occasion of Id-ul-Zuha.


    Following is the full text of the message -


    “I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of our country on the auspicious occasion of Id-ul-Zuha.


    Id-ul-Zuha is a celebration of unswerving devotion to God and the boundless compassion and love the Almighty has for His creation.


    The festival inspires us to inculcate empathy, practice sacrifice and promote peace and universal brotherhood.


    As India and the world continue to fight a relentless battle against the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, we have been forced to celebrate almost all of our traditional festivals, which were otherwise celebrated with great splendour, at home in a more subdued manner.


    Under these circumstances, we have to be content with a modest celebration and strictly adhere to the safety protocols of wearing masks, practicing physical distancing and personal hygiene during all our celebrations.


    May this Id-ul-Zuha bring peace, harmony and prosperity in our lives, country and the world.”
