    PM interacts with stakeholders from Banks and NBFCs


    Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi yesterday joined stakeholders from Banks and NBFCs to discuss and deliberate on vision and roadmap for the future. The crucial role of the financial and banking system of supporting growth was discussed. It was noted that the small entrepreneurs, SHGs, farmers should be motivated to use institutional credit to meet their credit needs and grow. Each bank needs to introspect and take a relook at its practices to ensure stable credit growth. Banks should not treat all proposals with the same yardstick and need to distinguish and identify bankable proposals and to ensure that they get access to funding on their merit and don’t suffer in the name of past NPAs. It was emphasised that the Government is firmly behind the banking system. The government is ready to take any steps necessary to support it and promote its growth. Banks should adopt fintech like centralised data platforms, digital documentation and collaborative use of information to move towards digital acquisition of customers. This will help increase credit penetration, increase ease for customers, lower costs for banks and also reduce frauds.
