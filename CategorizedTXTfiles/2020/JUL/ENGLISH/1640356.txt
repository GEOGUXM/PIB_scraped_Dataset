    The consistently increasing number of recovered person and growing difference between the active and recovered patients are a testimony that the strategies adopted by the Centre and implemented by the State/ UT governments are bearing desired outcomes. The primary focus has been on early detection through house-to-house surveys, surveillance, contact tracing, effective containment plans, screening of the vulnerable populace and wide-spread testing. The ramped up three-tier health infrastructure and well executed Standard of Care Protocol have aided in effective treatment in the hospitals and through home isolation.


    AIIMS, New Delhi along with the Centres of Excellence in the States/UTs have bolstered the clinical treatment and critical care of ICU patients, thereby managing to reduce the Case Fatality rate in India. The e-ICU program of AIIMS, New Delhi is one more avenue of Centre-State cooperation which is aimed at reducing mortality. Conducted twice a week, these tele-consultation sessions have mentored and supported big COVID-19 hospitals in States through shared experiences and technical advice from domain experts in clinical management of ICU patients. With the dedicated efforts of healthcare workers the recoveries are improving and case fatality is continuously falling, which currently stands at 2.41%.
