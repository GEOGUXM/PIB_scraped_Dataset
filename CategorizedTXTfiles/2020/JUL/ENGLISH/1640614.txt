    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:


         1. Crude oil production by ONGC in nomination block during June, 2020 was 1667.52 TMT which is 3.39%lower than target and 1.11% lower when compared with June 2019. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-June, 2020 was 5068.40 TMT which is 2.14%and 1.33% lower than target for the period andproduction during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * Closure of wells in Western Offshore due to less offtake due to Covid-19 Lockdown.

      * Production planned from WO16 cluster from June’20 could not be realized due to delay in MOPU (Sagar Samrat) as activities at GPC yard Abu Dhabi got affected due to Covid restrictions/lockdown
      * Production planned from new wells in Ratna field affected due to non- availability of ESPs due to implications of COVID-19.
      * Restriction of movements for field operations in Onshore fields due to Covid-19 lockdown.

         1. Crude oil production by OIL in the nomination during June, 2020 was241.70 TMT which is 4.46% lower than the monthly target and 9.63% lower than the June, 2019. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-June, 2019-20 was 746.40 TMT which is 2.40% and 7.47% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

      * Less than planned contribution from workover and drilling wells.
      * Less than planned contribution from Old well due to rise in water cut in wells & decline in total liquid production of wells as a consequential effect of the wells shut-in during bandhs against CAA.
      * Loss due to environmental issues sequel to Baghjan Blow out like protests/agitation etc.
      * Incessant rains leading to some installations and plinths submerged in flood waters resulting in production loss.
         1. Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs in the PSC regime during June,2020 was 617.76 TMT which islower by 6.19% than the monthly target and 15.88%lowerthanJune, 2019.Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-June, 2020 was 1860.39 TMT which is 5.66% and 17.81% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively.Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

      * RJ-ON-90/1: (1) Mangala - Optimization jobs and zone conversions could not be carried out. (2) Bhagyam – Artificial lift (PCP) malfunction & delayed startup of full field polymer injection. (3) Aishwarya – Delayed startup of polymer injection full field. (4) ABH - Delay in hookup of ABH Stage-2 wells. (5) Satellite Fields - Failure or flow cease in few wells. (6) Tukaram & Kaam-1 - Well and Surface Facility construction ongoing. Project schedule impacted by COVID-19. (CEIL)

      * CY-ONN-2002/2: Well MDDD was planned to put on production in June 2020, however, it could not be taken up due to local agitation. (ONGC)
      * CB-ONN-2000/1: (1) Well PK#2 is not producing due to casing collapse and soil breakthrough in the well. (2) Well SE_DEV#1, SE#1A and SE1#A1 is shut-in due to unavailability of effective demulsifier to break tight water and oil emulsion. (3) Minor shortfall in production in SRP operated well (PK2#A1, PK2#A2 & PL#1) due to power failure by UGVCL (power distributer). (GSPC)
      * KG-ONN-2003/1: Delay in completion of new infill wells on account of pending FDP submission and decline in production from 02 wells. (ONGC)
      * CB-ONN-2004/3: Production lower due to operational issues. (ONGC)

         1. Natural gas production by ONGC in the nomination during June, 2020 was 1818.97MMSCM which is 10.53% lower than target and 9.40% lower when compared with June 2019. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC duringApril-June, 2020 was 5350.60 MMSCM which is 11.66% and 12.68% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively.Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * Closure of gas wells in offshore due to less offtake in Western Offshore due to Covid-19 Lockdown.

      * Production planned from WO16 cluster from June’20 could not be realized due to delay in MOPU (Sagar Samrat) as activities at GPC yard Abu Dhabi got affected due to Covid restrictions/lockdown
      * Restricted/ no gas off take by consumers in onshore due to Covid-19 lockdown.

         1. Natural gas production by OIL in the nomination during June, 2020 was 219.24 MMSCM which is 15.48% lower than monthly target and 2.35% lower than June, 2019. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-June, 2020 was 649.52 MMSCM which is 11.58% and 4.47% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

      * Low upliftment by NTPS and NRPP due to technical issues.
      * Low upliftment by NEEPCO and also by Tea garden grids sequel to lockdown.
      * Environmental issues like Bandhs /blockade by local people and associations etc. after the Baghjan Blowout, protests/agitation etc.

         1. Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs in the PSC regime during June,2020 was 285.61 MMSCM which is 11.58% lowerthan monthly target and29.30% lower than June, 2019. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-June, 2020 was 785.03MMSCM which is 6.90% and 35.83% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

      * KG-DWN-98/3: Production not yet commenced from the field. (RIL)
      * RJ-ON/6: Less offtake by buyer. (FEL)
      * Sohagpur West: Dewatering Wells Gas breakout awaited and low due to scaling in producing wells and impact of COVID-19 lockdown. (RIL)
      * Ranigunj South: Due to Covid-19, company has choked the production due to lower offtake of Gas by many of our customers as they have stopped operating their plant which has adversely impacted our CBM gas sales. (GEECL)

    Figure 3: Crude Oil Processed (Crude Throughput)


         1. CPSE Refineries’ crude oil processed during June, 2020 was 10318.49TMT which is 17.11% lower than the target for the month and9.20%lowerwhen compared with June, 2019.Cumulative crude throughputby CPSE refineries during April-June, 2020 was 25802.93TMT which is 25.23% and 25.26% lower than target for the period and crude throughputduring corresponding period of last year respectively.The major reason for lower crude oil processed is due to lower demand due to impact of COVID-19 lockdown.


    3.2 JV refineries’ crude oil processed during June, 2020 was 1171.90TMT which is 2.10% lower than the target for the month and 32.33% lower when compared with June, 2019. Cumulative crude throughput during April-June, 2020 was 3190.25 TMT which is 12.11% and 39.13% lower than target for the period and crude throughput during corresponding period of last year respectively.


    3.3 Private refineries’ crude oil processed during June, 2020 was 6046.70TMT which is 16.10% lower than the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative crude throughputduring April-June, 2020 was 19636.21 TMT which is 13.95% lower than thecorresponding period of last year.


     1. Production of Petroleum Products


    Production of Petroleum Products during June, 2020 was 18724.75 TMT which is 11.02% lower than the target for the month and 8.89% lower when compared with June, 2019. Cumulative production during April-June, 2020 was 51963.85 TMT which is 16.29% and 18.23% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Unit-wise production of petroleum products is given at Annexure-V . Company-wise production for the month of June, 2020 and cumulatively for the period April-June, 2020 vis-à-Vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-4 and month-wise in Figure-4.
