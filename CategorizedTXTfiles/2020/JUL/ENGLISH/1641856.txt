    Single window system to be set up soon for industrial clearances and approvals


    The Government is soon going to set up a single window system for clearances and approvals of industry in the country. Commerce and Industry Minister Shri Piyush Goyal yesterday said that this would be a genuine single window and all the concerned State Governments and Central Ministries are being taken on board for the system. The Minister also said that the Government is working on creating a land bank, for which six States have already given their consent. He said that the potential investors would then be able to locate and identify the land banks from their distant offices and finalise the location of industries, without frequently visiting the offices of land owning agencies. Shri Piyush Goyal said that the Government rightly focused on life and implemented one of the strictest lockdown in the world. This proved important in the long run, in better managing the corona pandemic. Now the country is focusing on lives along with the livelihoods and we are into the unlock phase. The economic activity has already reached the respectable level as can be seen in the several indicators. He said India was able to create health infrastructure during the lockdown, as could be seen in self-sufficiency in the indigenous production of large number of PPEs and Ventilators, and such a large number of Covid tests being undertaken on daily basis.
