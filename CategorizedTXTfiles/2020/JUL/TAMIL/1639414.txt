    Union Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) had launched Pradhan MantriKisanUrjaSurakshaevamUtthaanMahabhiyaan (PM-KUSUM) scheme for the promotion of solar energy last year. The scheme aims to add solar and other renewable capacity of 25,750 MW by 2022 with total central financial support of Rs. 34,422 Crore . The Scheme consists of three components. Component A: 10,000 MW of Decentralized Ground Mounted Grid Connected Renewable Power Plants of individual plant size up to 2 MW. Component B: Installation of 17.50 lakh standalone Solar Powered Agriculture Pumps of individual pump capacity up to 7.5 HP and Component C: Solarisation of 10 Lakh Grid-connected Agriculture Pumps of individual pump capacity up to 7.5 HP. Under Component B, individual farmers will be supported to install standalone solar Agriculture pumps of capacity up to 7.5 HP. Under PM Kusum Scheme, 20 lakh farmers will be provided subsidy for setting up stand-alone solar pumps. Another 15 lakh farmers to be helped to solarise their grid-connected pump sets. This scheme will enable farmers to set up solar power generation capacity on their barren lands and to sell it to the power grid.


    In Tamil Nadu, PM Kusum scheme is implemented for installing 17500 solar pumps to farmers through agriculture engineering department. Under this scheme, central government is giving 30 per cent subsidy, Tamil Nadu government is giving 40 per cent subsidy and farmer has to bear 30 per cent of the cost. Sanction has been obtained from Union government during October last year for installation of 17,500 off-grid standalone solar powered pumping systems from 5 hp to 10 hp capacity with a validity of one year period. The rates and the companies for the implementation of the scheme have been finalized by Ministry of new and renewable energy through centralized tender. The programme is being implemented with 70% subsidy to the farmers, for the installation of 4,000 solar powered pumpsets in Phase I during the year 2019-20 with the subsidy assistance of Rs.107.31 crore. It is proposed to implement the installation of 13,500 solar powered pumpsets in Phase II, during the year 2020-21 with the subsidy assistance of Rs.365.54 crore.


    Agriculture officials said that in Tiruchirapalli farmers can contact Assistant Executive engineer in Agriculture Engineering department in Trichy, Musiri and Lalgudi for assistance. Farmers from Anthanallur, Manikandam, TiruverumburManaparaiVayyampatty villages should contact Trichy office for help regarding the scheme. The total price for 5 HP AC submerged solar pump motor is Rs 2.38 lakh and the farmer will have to pay 30 per cent ieRs 71,384 for the solar pump, they added.


    From time immemorial there is unending bond between farmers and mother nature. No wonder, Union government in coordination with state governments are implanting schemes to utilise energy resources that are renewable . Solar energy has great potential as it is eternal source of energy and greatly helps the UN goal of sustainable development without harming the mother nature.
