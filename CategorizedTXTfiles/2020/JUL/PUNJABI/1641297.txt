    Chandigarh, July 25, 2020


    For the first time, a record number of more than 4,20,000 COVID tests have been conducted in a single day. This elevated number comes on the heels of 3,50,000 tests having been done very day consistently over the last one week. With 4,20,898 samples tested in the last 24 hours, the Tests Per Million (TPM) has further increased to 11,485 and cumulative testing to 1,58,49,068. Both continue to maintain the upward trend. A strong factor contributing to this achievement is the persistent increase in the number of labs from merely one in January 2020 to 1301 today, inclusive of 902 government labs and 399 in the private sector across the country. There are 80 such labs (62 government labs & 18 private labs) in the states of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Union Territory of Chandigarh in the region.


    As governments are ramping their capacities in the region, doctors are also encouraging public to show up for testing in case they show any symptom. Dr Sukhwinder Singh who works in a Civil Hospital in Haryana calls upon the people not to delay the testing for COVID-19 in case they are experiencing symptoms like fever, breathlessness, loss of taste or smell, etc. & advises the patients to keep their morale high. As COVID-19 cases rise, the doctors besides carrying out their duties have also taken upon themselves the task of creating awareness about COVID-19 appropriate behaviour amongst masses as being done by Dr Rajeev Kumar Bhandari, SMO, District Faridkot in Punjab. He says that following basic precautions like maintaining physical distancing, wearing facemasks, regular washing of hands are important in fight against coronavirus.
