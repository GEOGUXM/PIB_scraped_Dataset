    South Eastern Railway (SER) has taken major initiatives for maintenance of passenger amenities at all stations in its jurisdiction despite the suspension of passenger services in the wake of Covid-19 followed by lockdowns. Improvement, augmentation and maintenance of the passenger amenities at Railway stations are continuous processes and are done as per requirement. The normal works are taken up for up gradation of passenger amenities as per the classification of stations.


    The passenger amenities and passenger facilities were taken care of during the lockdowns as a part of the asset maintenance activities. Presently there are 13 lifts and 14 escalators in the SER and these are well maintained on a regular basis. Though the passenger movement at the stations has been restricted, yet the maintenance works are continued with strict regularity. The maintenance of passenger amenity areas are, the extension and surfacing of the platforms, the second class & first class waiting halls, the ladies waiting rooms, the retiring rooms, the station toilets, the dust bins, the wash basins, the circulating areas, the booking offices, the parcel offices, the station fans, the fluorescent lights, the foot over bridges, the stair cases etc. Special care is also taken to disinfect the important gears.


    It is also mandatory to clean the station's premises and the station interface keeping in good working order at all times. Thorough sanitisation process is also done at all the areas of passenger amenity. The passenger amenity maintenance is an important activity for day to day monitoring.
