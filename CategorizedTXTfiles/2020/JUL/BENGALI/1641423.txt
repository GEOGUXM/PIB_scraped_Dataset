    Eastern Railway (ER) accomplished various asset maintenance and developmental works despite the lockdown like, dismantling of the old structures, maintenance of the overhead equipment, track maintenance, track renewal, S & T maintenance work, bridge maintenance work, construction work of ROB & RUB, construction work of the new FOB, laying of new line, electrification work etc.


    As a part of ERâ€™s endeavour towards achieving complete electrification, the work for electrification of Sagardighi Thermal Power Plant siding, a length of 12 Track Kilometre (TKM), in Malda Division of ER has been completed and the electric run in this siding was commissioned on July 22, 2020. It will lead to the end run daily five to six pairs of coal rakes on the electric traction. This will also result in faster and smoother supply of coal input to the thermal plant.


    Earlier in ER, the electrification work in Shivnarayanpur & Bhagalpur (Double line of 23 Route Kilometre) of Malda Division was also completed and commissioned, during the lockdown period.
