    With the rapid growth of passenger and freight traffic, it has become necessary on the part of South Eastern Railway (SER) to modernise and maintain the signalling and interlocking equipment at the stations on the important trunk lines in order to carry and ease the traffic movement.


    During the nationwide lockdown in the wake of COVID-19, SER has taken major initiatives in the works of Signal & Telecom asset maintenance all over its network. The maintenance of assets has been done in the area of Multiple-Aspect Signalling, Automatic Signalling, Route Relay and Panel Interlocking, Automatic Train Control, Signalling of Level Crossing, Public Address System, CCTVs at Stations etc.


    Asset maintenance works in the field of Signal & Telecommunications include Commissioning of Sliding Boom in level crossings for safety of the road users & Dual LVCD in stations for smooth train operations, Power Cable Meggering at different stations for uninterrupted power supply etc.


    The Signalling and Interlocking works have significantly ensured the safe and expeditious running of trains throughout the system. This maintenance of Signal & Telecom equipment provided with railways is a never-ending process and SER has been doing this during the lockdown in the form of old assets replacement, modernisation and their execution.
