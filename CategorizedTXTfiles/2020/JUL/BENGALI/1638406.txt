    Prof. Saikat Maitra, the Vice Chancellor of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology, W.B took has decided to reach out to the students and address their queries online. Not only the students but their parents can also interact directly with the Vice Chancellor on 14 th July from 7 p.m. (Bangladesh time 7:30 pm). This is for the first time a Vice Chancellor of any University has taken such initiative. He has informed that many such interactions will take place in future also.


    The all-pervading health threat blown up due to Covid-19 pandemic has put the entire education system in an unprecedented situation. Classes are on but the institutions are closed, teachers could be seen but cannot be reached, students know the chemical equations but cannot practice in the laboratory. They are getting stressed up both psychological and physically being confined to their home with countless queries pertaining to exams, education, career prospects and all. In this scenario the Vice Chancellor has decided to directly talk to the students and satisfy them.


    The Vice chancellor has also informed that the University has launched a helpline named ‘Solutions to closer relationship with students’ ‘Samadhan’ The students are getting information about academics through this online number. They can also WhatsApp on this number for the solution.
