    Taking advantage of the considerably less pressure of traffic on railway track during the COVID-19 lockdown, Eastern Railway (ER) in all its divisions is carrying out various engineering, mechanical and signalling works with the objective of offering even better services to the rail users.


    The engineering and bridge team of Asansol Division successfully launched three 21.5M girder of Foot Overbridge (FOB) at Narganjo station on the Sitarampur – Jhajha section by using road crane on Tuesday during the traffic-cum-power Block from 3.00 pm. to 5.00 pm.


    This is the third Foot Overbridge (FOB) that has been launched by Asansol Division in June 2020 fully utilising the advantage of COVID-19 lockdown without affecting the service punctuality.
