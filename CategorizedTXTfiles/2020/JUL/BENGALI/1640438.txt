    With the Howrah-Mumbai trunk route witnessing heavy growth of rail traffic, this third line project became essential. The existing main line has become fully saturated due to which the operation of Passenger and Freight train services have become extremely difficult as well as complicated. With a view to provide additional line capacity, to ease the congestion and for more mobility of freight and passenger train movement, this third line project is given high priority.


    The 27.9 km long Dhutra-Bamra third line work of Rourkela-Jharsuguda third Line project (101 km) has been completed and the remaining 73.1 km work is moving well in phased manner.
