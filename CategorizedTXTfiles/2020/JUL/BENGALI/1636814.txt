    With a view to extend the freight basket of Indian Railways, there is an urgent need to take planned measures to increase the existing volume of freight traffic. For this, South Eastern Railway (SER) is making all out efforts to increase its share in traditional commodities carried and a strong foray is made into miscellaneous non-bulk goods.


    To attract the miscellaneous non-bulk commodities for transportation by rail, SER, in accordance with the directives given by the Railway Board, SER has decided to set up a multi disciplinary Business Development Unit (BDU) comprising Senior Officers from various departments at Zonal level coordinated by the Chief Freight Transportation Manager. Similarly, the BDUs will also be set up at Divisional level and will be coordinated by Sr. Divisional Operations Manager of respective divisions.


    The main objective of such BDUs is to put forward lucrative offer to fetch business from the traders and industries by frequent interactions with them. Any proposal received from the traders will be given top priority and analysed promptly.


    In addition, the BDUs will also be functional at Railway Board level with a view to facilitate and give clearance to the proposals received from the Zonal Railways.


    Interested Industries and traders of West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha who come under the jurisdiction of SER system are asked to contact the following officers:
