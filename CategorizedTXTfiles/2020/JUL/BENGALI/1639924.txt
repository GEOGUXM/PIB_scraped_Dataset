    Thermal scanning camera has been installed and commissioned at the Main entrance of Malda Station with Ticket Scanner. Similar type of thermal scanning camera has also been installed at Jamalpur, Bhagalpur and Sahibganj stations, informed Eastern Railway (ER) in a press release. The basic objective of these thermal scanning machines is to generate health related safety to the travelling passenger in the mission to thwart the spread of ongoing COVID 19.


    The system will be helpful in quick scanning of passenger's temperature without stopping at the entrance with photographs. At a time 10 to 15 persons can be diagnosed whether they have more temperature than the prescribed limit and it can detect persons from 3 metre distance with an accuracy of +/-0.5Â°F. The system has one ticket scanner which is connected with the screen. After thermal scanning of passengers, they will put his/her ticket under scanner for on line checking. This system is equipped with an audio and visual alarm system for generating alarms against symptomatic passengers and will flash red light. It has a Network Video Recorder (NVR) with 4 TB Hard Disk and has 42" LED Commercial display for easy scrutiny.
