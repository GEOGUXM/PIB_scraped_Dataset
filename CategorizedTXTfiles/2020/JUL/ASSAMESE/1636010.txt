      Fact Check : Does asymptomatic person spread COVID
      Posted On: 02 JUL 2020 9:38PM by PIB Guwahati


    A video making round in social media suggesting that WHO official have stated that COVID-19 virus was unlikely to spread through asymptomatic person to others.


    It is to be noted that the claim itself was refuted by top World Health Organization official on 9th June 2020 and clarified that scientists have not determined yet how frequently people with asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 pass the disease on to others.


    This clarification had come after the WHO’s original comments incited strong pushback from outside public health experts, who suggested the agency had erred, or at least miscommunicated, when it said people who didn’t show symptoms were unlikely to spread the virus.


    The video in question is nearly one month old but have been circulating in the social media at present.


    WHO officials have further stressed that even as scientists are still learning more about the virus and how it spreads, countries have demonstrated that the best tactics to address the pandemic include isolating cases, contact tracing, and quarantining contacts — as well as hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette and social distancing.


    Worldwide, Corona virus has affected nearly 11 million people and caused death of over half a million people, while nearly seven million people have also recovered. In India the Corona positive cases have crossed six lakh with nearly 18 thousand deaths and over 3 lakh 61 thousand patients being recovered.


    With these figures, India stands in fourth place of highest infected people with COVID-19, while USA, Brazil and Russia are chronologically placed in first to third place respectively.
