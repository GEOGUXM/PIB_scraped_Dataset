    Environmental Impact Assessment

      * Environmental Impact Assessment by M/s ERM: As a part of the study, ERM team has conducted ecological survey in Baghjangaon, Notungaon, Guijan, Dighaltarang area yesterday. The study will be continued till one week beyond the date of capping the well successfully.
      * TERI study on Bioremediation of Sludge : Debris clearance in high land areas are being carried for site preparation prior to bio remediation job. Application of bio material will be started once water level recedes and site preparation is completed in the affected areas.
      * CSIR-NEIST Seismological Study : Recording is in progress for seismological study in the vicinity of Baghjan-5 well.

    Preparation for Capping the Well

      * Debris Removal: All major debris has been cleared from the well plinth. A detailed inspection of the well was undertaken today jointly by Alert, ONGC & OIL technical team to decide the next course of action.

    · Water Deluge System: Water reservoirs are being filled up periodically. All three ONGC & OIL CMT Water Pumps are ready for delivery and are in use depending on requirement.

      * Pump Station#01 & #02 at River bank : Water Pump Station #01 & #2 are in operation.

    Relief and Rehabilitation


    · Survey job for assessment of damage for compensation in both Tinsukia and Doomdooma Circle is in progress today. 8 more families were surveyed on 14.07.2020 making total family surveyed in Doomdooma Circle 577 . 90 more families were surveyed on 14.07.2020 in Tinsukia Circle 914 making total family surveyed in Tinsukia Circle 914 . Total number of families surveyed till 14.07.2020 in both Tinsukia and Doomddoma Circles is 1491.


    Law and Order/Bandhs/Blockades etc.

      * Blockade at EPS Baghjan Continues: Blockade still continues at Baghjan EPS. Due to the blockade, 4 gas wells and 8 oil wells under Baghjan EPS had to be shut since 07.07.2020. As a result, approx. 1.5-1.6 MMSCMD gas has gone out from the grid which ultimately led to curtailment of gas supply to all consumers. Additionally, there is a daily oil production loss to the tune of around 500 KL from these wells. The cumulative loss is 3457 MT of Crude Oil and 11.41 MMSCM of Natural Gas in last 8 days.
      * Blockades in Drilling and Work Over Locations Continue : Blockade at two drilling locations and three workover locations still continues in and around Baghjan area.

    Impact on Oil/Gas Production due to Protests


    · Due to stoppage/blockades, there was production loss of 441 MT of Crude Oil and 1.34 MMSCM of Natural Gas as reported on 14-07-2020. Operations were disrupted in 11 Oil wells & 04 gas wells. Cumulative production loss since 27 th May, 2020 due to bandhs and blockades: 12657 MT Crude oil, 23.38 MMSCM of natural gas.
