    A fake news has been circulating in WhatsApp groups where it is mentioned that the Government has finally approved and have started giving out free Rs. 2000 Relief Fund to each citizen. The message also mentions that to claim the said amount instantly one just needs to click the link: https://bit.ly/india-relief . It is further stated that on clicking the link, a survey questionnaire is posted which is supposed to be filled up to claim the amount. A picture of Lion Capital is also posted with the link to make it look authentic.


    It is to be noted that Government has not approved or launched any such Relief Fund. It is completely baseless and misleading information. The Government is not crediting any amount in the above mentioned manner. The use of Lion Capital picture is to only deceive the public. People are requested to restrain from falling prey to any such news reports which are fake and unauthentic.

Such information can cause great damage in terms of rumour mongering and the spread of wrong information. People using these platforms should exercise restrain in forwarding such messages.
