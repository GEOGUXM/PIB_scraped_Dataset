    A news report is being circulated widely in social media that 8 doctors of Tomo Riba Institute of Health and Medical Sciences (TRIHMS) in Arunachal Pradesh are infected by COVID-19. The Directorate of Information and Public Relations, Government of Arunachal Pradesh in a statement clarified that the news is fake as no doctor of the TRIHMS is infected with COVID-19.


    Dr. L. Jampa, Nodal Officer, COVID-19 Monitoring Team and Dr. Dipu Lowang, Assistant Nodal Officer COVID-19 Monitoring Team expressed concern over rampant sharing and forwarding of fake news like this which hampers the efforts of the doctors who are in forefront to fight the pandemic. They urged the people to refrain from posting fake news, especially pertaining to COVID-19 pandemic as it is likely to create fear and panic among the people.


    Posting of unverified information which can create panic and fear among the people is a very serious offence and can invite legal action against the rumour mongers. People should refrain from spreading false news in this hour of crisis.
