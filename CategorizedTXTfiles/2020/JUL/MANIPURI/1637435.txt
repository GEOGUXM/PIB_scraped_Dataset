    On 7 th July, 2020, one unknown person made a Social Media post on Whatsapp stating that two COVID-19 positive persons escaped from Lawngtlai Quarantine Facility, which was widely circulated on various social media platforms. The message has led to panic and distress among the general public.


    Mizoram Police immediately proceeded with investigation and verified that there was no such incident of escape from District Quarantine Centre and COVID care Centre, a Mizoram Police press statement said. The originator of the post was identified by the Police and a case has been registered against him. The person has been arrested and sent to judicial custody.


    Posting of unverified information which can create panic and fear among the public is a very serious offense and can invite legal action against the rumour mongers. People should refrain from spreading false news in this hour of crisis.
