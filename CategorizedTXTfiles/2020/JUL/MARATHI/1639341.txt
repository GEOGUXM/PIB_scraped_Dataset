    Although, India is reporting increased number of Covid 19 cases following widening of testing, the ray of hope is the rising recovery rate, which is aiding continuous decline in Covid 19 active cases. According to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the recovery rate has shot up from 52% in mid June to more than 63% by mid July. As on date, the actual case load of Covid 19 in the country is 3,42,756, while the number of cured is approximately 6.35 lakhs making for 63% of reported cases.


    In Maharashtra, Mumbai is nearing the 1 lakh mark as far as the number of reported cases is concerned. But it has also clocked one of the impressive recovery rates at nearly70%, which is 7% higher than the national average and nearly 15% higher than Maharashtra which has clocked a recovery rate of 55.62%. According the data released by the Medical Education & Drugs Department (MEDD) on Friday, the number of active cases in Mumbai is 24,307 while the number of patients recovered stands at 67,830.


    The Covid 19 recovery rate in Mumbai stood at 50% around mid June, when the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) launched the ‘Mission Zero’ under Rapid Action Plan to contain Coronavirus transmission. The rate improved to 57 per cent on July 1 and further to around 70% by 15 th July. The focus of Covid 19 containment has now shifted to Mumbai satellite cities – Thane, Kalyan-Dombivili and Mira-Bhayandar.


    Across India, Delhi has posted a recovery rate of 82% against total reported cases of 118,645. Rajasthan, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat have also posted good recovery rate of 70% or above.


    T he collaborative efforts of all States/UTs for house-to-house surveys, contact tracing, surveillance of containment and buffer zones, perimeter control activities, aggressive testing and timely diagnosis has resulted in early identification of the infected persons. This has helped in early treatment too.


    India has followed a standard of care protocol for the differentiated categorisation of COVID-19 patients- mild, moderate and severe as clearly formulated in the Clinical Management Protocol of Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW). The effective clinical management strategies have shown to yield positive results. Almost 80% of the asymptomatic and mild cases are advised home isolation under medical supervision. The strategy of home isolation for the mild and asymptomatic patients has ensured to keep the hospitals unburdened, where the focus has been on treatment of the severe cases and reduction of fatality. It is also notable that less than 1.94% of the cases are in ICUs, 0.35% cases are on ventilators and 2.81% cases are on Oxygen beds.


    As a result of concerted efforts, the COVID-19 Hospital Infrastructure to treat COVID-19 is stronger today. There are 1,383 Dedicated COVID Hospitals, 3107 Dedicated COVID Healthcare Centres, and 10,382 COVID Care Centres across India.
