    Films Division is paying tribute to great freedom fighter-social reformer, Baal Gangadhar Tilak, fondly called “Lokamanya” on his 100th death anniversary on 1st August 2020. A rare documentary made in late 50s, dedicated to his life and works including the pivotal role Tilak played in Indian independence movement, will be streamed on 1st August on Films Division Website and YouTube channel. The free viewing is available for 24 hours.


    Lokmanya Tilak (22 Min/B&W/Eng/1957) directed by well-known Marathi writer-director, Vishram Bedekar, is a notable experiment in screen biography which brings to life, without the medium of a living character, the dramatic achievements when Lokmanya Tilak dominated the Indian freedom struggle scene by his austere example and relentless struggle against the foreign rule.


    Through this biopic, the viewer can experience Tilak’s strong spirit of nationalism especially his ardent support for Swadeshi products which is very relevant today when we strive to be self reliant in all spheres of life.
