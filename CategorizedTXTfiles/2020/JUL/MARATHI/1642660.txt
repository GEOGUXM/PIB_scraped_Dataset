    The National Cadet Corps Directorate of Maharashtra has planted over 37 thousand saplings across the state during the tree plantation drive which started on June 05, 2020(World Environment day). Over 36 thousand NCC cadets and their families participated in the plantation drive that concluded yesterday. The aim of the plantation drive is to increase the Green cover of our country, fight the menace of global warming and to create better environment for the next generation.


    Despite the state-wide lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic, the NCC cadets participated enthusiastically in the plantation drive. The spirit of NCC cadets was undeterred as they planted saplings even in their backyards.


    As part of the drive, the NCC Cadets & Associate NCC Officers of various schools and colleges took a pledge to plant a tree sapling at home, neighbourhood or at their native places. They also took the responsibility to spread awareness about the challenges of global warming and the need for increasing the green cover on earth.


    Cadets used Social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp to encourage citizens to plant trees by posting motivational pictures and videos. Local citizens praised the efforts of NCC cadets and extended full support to them during the drive.
