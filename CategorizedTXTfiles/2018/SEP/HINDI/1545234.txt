    Union Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports (I/C) Col Rajyavardhan Rathore today felicitated Indian ace athlete Govindan Lakshmanan for his excellent performance in the recently concluded Asian Games at Jakarta. Lakshmanan was unfortunate to have missed the medal as he was disqualified at the end of the 10,000 metre race for no fault of his. Lakshmanan had stepped off the track momentarily, as he was hit by the spike of another athlete. The Indian team protested against the disqualification at two levels but it was turned down. To encourage the athlete to keep doing the hard work and strive for the medals, the Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Col Rajyavardhan Rathore rewarded him Rs 10,00,000/- ( Rupees Ten Lacs only).
