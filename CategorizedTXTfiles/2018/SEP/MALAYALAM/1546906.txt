    Graffiti on the theme Indian culture and Swachh Bharat painted by students of St.Teresas College, Ernakulam has given a new look to the entrance of Ernakulam Wharf of Cochin Port. The painting was carried out by about 30 students during the last three days as a voluntary work towards promoting Swachh Bharat initiative. The graffiti will be a popular attraction in the days to come as the same is on the entry & exit gate route of cruise tourists arriving at the port by big international cruise lines.


    The three-day long cleaning drive at KK Premachandran Sports Ground area by Civil Engineering Department was completed today and 24 cu.m loads of excess vegetation was removed. All departments in Cochin Port Trust carried out dusting and vacuum cleaning of record rooms.
