    The Prime Minister said that for the States that are a part of PMJAY, people can get the benefit of the scheme in whichever of these States they go to. He said more than 13,000 hospitals across the country have joined the scheme so far.


    The Prime Minister also spoke of the 10 health and wellness centres inaugurated today. He said the number of such centres across the country has reached 2300. He said the aim is to have 1.5 lakh such centres in India within four years.
