    Geological Survey of India (GSI) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with National Remote Sensing Centre-Indian Space Research Organisation (NRSC-ISRO) recently (September 5, 2018) at GSI in presence of its Director General Dr Dinesh Gupta and Director, NRSC , Shri Santanu Chowdhury. The main objective of the MoU is to utilize the airborne Hyperspectral data by the scientists of GSI and ISRO to find surface signatures of mineralisation in 14 promising mineralized blocks in different parts of the country in the coming three years.


    It is to be noted that Hyperspectral data has immense potential for mineral exploration with regard to mapping of the host rock and surface alterations associated with the mineral forming processes. Hyperspectral remote sensing is also used for mapping minerals on Moon and Mars. GSI is using such advanced technologies for mineral mapping to ensure resource security of our country.


    GSI is also in the pursuit of utilising ultra-modern remote sensing technology for the first time in India using sensor developed by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) named â€˜Advanced Visible Infra-Red Imaging Spectrometer Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) to locate minerals like lead, zinc, copper, platinum, diamond, gold and other associated minerals. Recently, AVIRIS-NG sensor was mounted onboard ISRO aircraft for acquiring the Hyperspectral images of the above-mentioned 14 mineralized blocks scattered in Jhagadia and Ambaji of Gujarat, Zawar, Udaipur, Pur Banera, Jahazpur and Bhukia of Rajasthan, Hutti-Maski of Karnataka, Tundi in Jharkhand, Chattarpur of Madhya Pradesh and the like.
