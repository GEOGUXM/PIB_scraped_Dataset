    Kolkata, September 07, 2018.


    Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has introduced a new facility for its esteemed members having Universal Account Number (UAN) and other relevant details to link their respective UAN with Aadhaar online.


    Using the facility, EPFO members can online link their respective UAN with Aadhaar. While using the facility, the member will have to provide his/her UAN. An OTP will be sent on his/her Aadhaar Number. Another OTP will be sent to his/her moble/email linked with Aadhaar. After OTP verification, if UAN details are matched with Aadhaar details, then UAN will be linked with Aadhaar. After linking, the EPFO member may avail online EPFO services linked with Aadhhar.


    Employees can now also submit claims in a Composite Claim Form which has replaced the multiple claim forms. The multiple documentation earlier required while preferring claims for advances has also been done away with.


    The employers can also avail benefit of 12% of the Employer’s Contribution for every new employee engaged by them under the Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY). The scheme started in the month of August, 2016 and will continue for three years till March 31, 2019.


    EPF pensioners can now submit digital Life Certificate through a hassle-free functionality through biometric capture of Aadhaar.
