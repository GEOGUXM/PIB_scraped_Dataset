    The associations like Globoil work as bridge between government on one side and consumers/farmers on the other side. 60 percent of the total requirement of edible oil in the country is imported. Keeping in mind industry demand and WTO obligations, the difference of 10 percent on duties of imported and locally produced oil has been maintained. This was stated by Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Shri Ram Vilas Paswan while speaking on the 22 nd Anniversary Awards Ceremony of Globoil.


    The Minister said that there will be stock of 165 lakh tonnes of sugar by next October, and that the government is thinking about ways to utilise it. He said that various steps being taken by the government such as increase in MSP and provision of good quality seeds are leading to increased production. The Government has increased the target of sugar exports from 20 lakh tonne to 50 lakh tonne and has given further incentives like sharing of freight charges and handling charges to promote exports.


    Shri Paswan said that Food ministry has to balance the interests of farmers on the one hand and consumers on the other while deciding the support price, and that it does not buckle under industry pressure. He said the government has increased MSP of many crops to a great deal and the production of edible oil can be doubled by 2022 if new innovations are brought into the agriculture sector.
