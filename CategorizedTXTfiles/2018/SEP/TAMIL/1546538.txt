      INCOME TAX DEPARTMENT CAUTIONS ABOUT FRAUDULENT MAILS ASKING FOR BANK DETAILS FOR REFUND
      Posted On: 18 SEP 2018 5:38PM by PIB Chennai


    It has been brought to the notice of Income Tax Department, Chennai that certain emails and SMS are being received by taxpayers asking them to submit a refund request by following the link provided in the email/SMS.


    In this regard, it is hereby clarified that such emails/SMS are fake and not sent by the Income Tax Department. It is further clarified that Income Tax Department never asks for Password, Bank details etc.. by way of email or SMS. The updation of personal details viz., Address, Bank Account Number etc. has to be done only by the taxpayer by logging into his/her own e-filing account through the official website of the Department i.e, https://www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in .


    Hence, it is requested that taxpayers may remain vigilant and do not fall prey to such spurious emails/SMS.
