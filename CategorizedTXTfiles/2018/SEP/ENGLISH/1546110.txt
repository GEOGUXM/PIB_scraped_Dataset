The index for ‘Manufacture of Textiles’ group rose by 0.4 percent to 117.6 (provisional) from 117.1 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of manufacture of made-up textile articles, except apparel (2%) and synthetic yarn, texturised & twisted yarn, manufacture of knitted & crocheted fabrics and cotton yarn (1% each). However, the price of manufacture of other textiles (1%) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Wood and of Products of Wood and Cork ‘ group rose by 0.6 percent to 132.8 (provisional) from 132.0 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of lamination wooden sheets/veneer sheets (2%) and plywood block boards (1%). However, the price of timber/wooden plank, sawn/resawn (1%) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Other Non-Metallic Mineral Products’ group rose by 0.2 percent to 115.9 (provisional) from 115.7 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of ordinary sheet glass and toughened glass (3% each), railway sleeper, glass bottle, porcelain sanitary ware, clinker, non-ceramic tiles and fibre glass incl. sheet (2% each) and cement blocks (concrete), ceramic tiles (vitrified tiles) and porcelain crockery (1% each). However, the price of white cement (2%) and poles & posts of concrete, asbestos corrugated sheet, slag cement, cement superfine and granite (1% each) declined.
