    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, has greeted teachers across the country on the eve of Teachers’ Day.


    In a message, the President has said, “On the occasion of Teachers’ Day, I have great pleasure in extending my greetings and felicitations to teachers.


    A characteristic feature of our culture and heritage has been the Guru-Shishya Parampara. We are very fortunate and blessed as a civilization to have always had, since time immemorial, great gurus who have led seekers of truth to their goal.


    Today, on Teachers’ Day, we remember the lasting contributions made by the former President, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, an eminent scholar and educationist.


    Let us pray, on this auspicious day, that our Gurus continue to help and guide us, individually and collectively, in building a nation and world defined by wisdom, peace and harmony”.
