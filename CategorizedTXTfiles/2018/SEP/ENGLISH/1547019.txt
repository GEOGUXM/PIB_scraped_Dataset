    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:

         1. Crude oil production by ONGC during August, 2018 was 1783.38 TMT which is 7.59% lower than the monthly target and 6.06% lower when compared with August, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-August, 2018 was 8964.81 TMT which is 4.26% lower than target for the period and lower by 5.21% than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall are as under:

             1. Electric Submersible Pumps (ESP) problem in wells of NBP field (Rig deployment post monsoon).

             2. Less than planned production from WO-16 and B-127 fields in the absence of MOPUs Sagar Samrat and Sagar Laxmi.
             3. Sub-sea leakage in some well fluid lines of Mumbai High & Neelam Heera Assets leading to flow restriction (line replacement to commence post monsoon under PRP-V scheme).
             4. Low Gas injection pressure in Geleki, Lakwa & increase in water cut in Geleki, Lakwa, Lakhmani & Rudrasagar fields.

         1. Crude oil production by OIL during August, 2018 was 286.34 TMT which is 8.04% lower than monthly target and 0.74% lower when compared with August, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-August, 2018 was 1411.41 TMT which is 5.12% lower than target for the period and 0.41% lower than production during the corresponding period of last year. Major reason for lower production is less than planned contribution from work over wells and drilling wells.


         1. Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during August, 2018 was 838.40 TMT which is 3.42% lower than the monthly target but 0.65% higher than August, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-August, 2018 was 4235.31 TMT which is 1.46 % lower than target for the period but marginally higher by 0.12% than production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall are as under:


     1. Panna-Mukta: Natural decline in the field (SHELL).

     2. Ravva: Natural Decline in the field (CEIL).
     3. RJ-ON-90/1: Mangala production is less due to power fluid pump P-417B under maintenance for seal inspection (CEIL).

    2. Natural Gas


    Natural gas production during August, 2018 was 2789.34 MMSCM which is 8.10% lower than the target for the month but 0.59% higher when compared with August, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production during April-August, 2018 was 13571.68 MMSCM which is 7.77% lower than target for the period and 0.86% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II . Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of August, 2018 and cumulatively for the period April-August, 2018 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

    Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production


         1. Natural gas production by ONGC during August, 2018 was 2061.90 MMSCM which is 6.55% lower than the monthly target and but 5.56% higher when compared with August, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC during April-August, 2018 was 10013.07 MMSCM which is 6.07% lower than the cumulative target but 2.83% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year. The reasons for shortfall are as under:


     1. Restricted off-take ex-Odalarevu in Eastern Offshore Asset.

     2. Less than planned gas production from WO-16 and B-127 fields in the absence of MOPUs Sagar Samrat and Sagar Laxmi.
     3. Pressure / potential decline in gas wells of Gandhar field.
     4. Less off-take by consumers/ grid restrictions in Tripura.

         1. Natural gas production by OIL during August, 2018 was 236.97 MMSCM which is 12.62% lower than the monthly target and 9.37% lower than August, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-August, 2018 was 1137.41 MMSCM which is 14.32% and 7.92% lower than the cumulative target and production respectively during the corresponding period of last year. Major reason for lower production is loss of well head production potential of high producing wells of Deohal area, due to downhole tubing corrosion.


         1. Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during August, 2018 was 490.47 MMSCM which is 12.05% lower than the monthly target and 12.14% lower when compared with August, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-August, 2018 was 2421.20 MMSCM which is 11.26% lower than the cumulative target and 10.88% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall are as under:


     1. Panna-Mukta: Gas Production Lower due to wells underperformance and water loading post unplanned shutdown (SHELL).

     2. KG-DWN-98/3: Closure of 2 wells in D1D3 and 1 well in MA field. Well B6 ceased to flow due to low reservoir pressure. (RIL)
