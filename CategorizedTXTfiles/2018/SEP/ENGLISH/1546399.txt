    The Union Minister for Human Resource Development, Shri Prakash Javadekar will confer the Swachh Vidyalaya Puraskar 2017 – 18 at Dr. Ambedkar International Centre on 18 th September, 2018 in New Delhi, as a part of the Swachhata Hi Seva campaign launched by Prime Minister on 15 th September, 2018. Dr. Satya Pal Singh, Minister of State, HRD will also be present on the occasion.


    The Department of School Education and Literacy, MHRD launched the Swachh Vidyalaya Puraskar in 2016-17 to honour the schools that have done exemplary work in the field of water, sanitation and hygiene. These awards are given to ensure long term sustainability and behaviour change towards cleanliness. It also provides a benchmark and roadmap for schools to make further improvements. This year, first time the awards have also been extended to private schools besides government and government aided schools.


    This Puraskar was launched as a follow up to the Swachh Vidyalaya Initiative launched in 2014. In his Independence Day address to the nation on 15 th August, 2014, the Prime Minister declared that all schools in the country should have toilets with separate toilets for girls within a period of one year. Only then our daughters will not be compelled to leave schools mid way.


    Under Swachh Vidyalaya Initiative, a record number of 4,17,796 toilets were constructed in 2,61,400 schools, including 1,90,887 girls toilets in one year upto 15 th August, 2015. This was achieved in collaboration with States and UTs and Corporates and PSUs.
