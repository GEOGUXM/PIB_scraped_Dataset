    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced a function organised to felicitate Indian scholars who were acknowledged at the 11 th World Hindi Conference – held recently in Mauritius – in New Delhi today (September 17, 2018).


    Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Hindi has a strong presence on the world map. Outside India, more than one crore people speak Hindi and it is being taught in universities of major countries. The 11th World Hindi Conference saw the participation of more than 2,000 representatives from 45 countries.


    The President said that to enhance its presence, Hindi has to adapt to science and technology – both in content and dissemination. We live in the age of technology, the President said. Smart-phones are eroding distances between languages and technology could similarly be used in the propagation of Hindi. The President also praised the role played by Hindi cinema in popularising the language in India and abroad.
