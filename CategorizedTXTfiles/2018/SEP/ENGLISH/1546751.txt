Harpreet Singh, Post Master General (M& BD), and Dr. KS Sachdeva, DDG TB.


    A significant proportion of patients are not tested becausethe specimen does not reach the laboratory due to non-availability ofspecimen transportmechanisms.Transport of collected specimen also spares the patientâ€™s from travelling to the reference laboratory. Prompt transport of specimen followed by efficacious testing will enable appropriate management of the TB patients and reduced disease transmission.


    The learning from Delhi Pilot experience will be useful for adaptation of specimen transport mechanism throughthe Postal Department across the country.
