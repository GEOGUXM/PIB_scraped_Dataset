    In a bid to understand and address the challenges faced by the district administrations in implementing skill programs and help develop capacities, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri Dharmendra Pradhan has approved a plan for visits of the senior officers of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurships to the ‘Aspirational Districts’ between October 2, 2018 and January 26, 2019.


    Government of India has launched the Aspirational Districts Program to effectively transform the identified districts through convergence of Central and State schemes; collaborations among officers and creating competition among districts. This program lays emphasis on district to bring about overall improvement in the living standard of the citizens and ensuring ‘Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas.’ One of the key focus areas of this program is skill development.


      The visit of officers of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurships will begin with a meeting with Districts Collector / CEO-Zila Parishad and other State level officers implementing the programs. The team will also have interactions with Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendras, training providers, ITIs, Polytechnics and JSS administrations. The team would also have conversation with students and industry present in these districts. This will enable a stock taking of the available skill ecosystem vis-à-vis the available data and provide good understanding of challenges to be addressed at the district level to make youth employable. A detailed reporting format has been prepared which would be utilized by the visiting team.
