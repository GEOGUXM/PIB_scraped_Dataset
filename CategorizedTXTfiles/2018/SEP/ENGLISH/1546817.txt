      Water storage level of 91 major reservoirs of the country goes down by one percent
      Posted On: 20 SEP 2018 4:29PM by PIB Delhi


    The water storage available in 91 major reservoirs of the country for the week ending on September 20, 2018 was 120.087 BCM which is 74% of total storage capacity of these reservoirs. This percentage was at 75% for the week ending on September 13, 2018. The level of water storage in the week ending on September 20, 2018 was 123% of the storage of corresponding period of last year and 105% of storage of average of last ten years.


    The total storage capacity of these 91 reservoirs is 161.993 BCM which is about 63% of the total storage capacity of 257.812 BCM which is estimated to have been created in the country. 37 Reservoirs out of these 91 have hydropower benefit with installed capacity of more than 60 MW.


    REGION WISE STORAGE STATUS:-


    NORTHERN REGION


    The northern region includes States of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan. There are six reservoirs under Central Water Commission (CWC) monitoring having total live storage capacity of 18.01 BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 13.87 BCM which is 77% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 84% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 83% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is less than the corresponding period of last year and is also less than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.


    EASTERN REGION


    The Eastern region includes States of Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal and Tripura. There are 15 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 18.83 BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 15.85 BCM which is 84% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 62% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 70% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is better than the corresponding period of last year and is also better than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.


    WESTERN REGION


    The Western region includes States of Gujarat and Maharashtra. There are 27 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 31.26 BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 17.16 BCM which is 55% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 68% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 66% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is less than the storage of last year and is also less than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.


    CENTRAL REGION


    The Central region includes States of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. There are 12 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 42.30 BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 33.30 BCM which is 79% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 60% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 73% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is better than the storage of last year and is also better than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.


    SOUTHERN REGION


    The Southern region includes States of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, AP&TG (Two combined projects in both states), Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. There are 31 reservoirs under CWC monitoring having total live storage capacity of 51.59 BCM. The total live storage available in these reservoirs is 39.91 BCM which is 77% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 46% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 67% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, storage during current year is better than the corresponding period of last year and is also better than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
States having better storage than last year for corresponding period are Jharkhand, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, AP&TG (Two combined projects in both states), Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. States having equal storage than last year for corresponding period is Punjab. States having lesser storage than last year for corresponding period are Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Tripura, Gujarat and Maharashtra.
