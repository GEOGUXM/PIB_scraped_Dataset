    A delegation of Association of Group ‘B’ (Gazetted) officers of Survey of India under Department of Science & Technology, met the Union Minister of Development of North Eastern Region (I/C), Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today. The delegation was led by its General Secretary, Shri Umesh Mishra.


    The Association presented a memorandum to the Minister regarding the delay in promotion of Officer Surveyors to the post of Superintending Surveyors. The Association informed that a large number of Superintending Surveyors’ posts are vacant. They added that 125 posts of Superintending Surveyor posts out of sanctioned 160 posts (90 Civil and 70 Defence) are vacant as per Survey of India Group ‘A’ Service Rules, 1989. About 200 officer Surveyors have completed their eligibility of 8 years and are waiting for their next promotion for the last 12-15 years. The Department of Science & Technology has already taken up this matter with DoPT for obtaining one time relaxation in Survey of India Group ‘A’ Service Rules, 1989 for promoting Officer Surveyors to the post of superintending Surveyors.


    Dr Jitendra Singh said that it is the priority of the DoPT to ensure timely promotions of officers and to address their issues in order to avoid unnecessary delays in promotions. He assured the Association that he will take up the issue with concerned DoPT officials and expedite the matter as per the rules.
