    Director General NCC Lt Gen PP Malhotra, flagged-in the NCC Girls Expedition team to Mt Deo-Tibba (which in Hindu mythology means the assembly place of the Gods) in Himachal Pradesh at DGNCC HQ in New Delhi on 28 September 2018. He congratulated the girl cadets and their support staff for successful ascent to the peak on 19 September 2018. The Team Leader Lt Col Gulshan Chadha and Deputy Leader Maj Swati Basedia handed over the Expedition Flag to the DG during the ceremony.


    This all girls expedition was the first expedition to climb the peak in the current year. The inclement weather hidden crevasses, steep gradients and glaciated approach had made the climb challenging and tough.


    In his address, the DG NCC congratulated the Cadets for their grit and perseverance. He said that their adventurous sojourn has set an example for others to emulate.
