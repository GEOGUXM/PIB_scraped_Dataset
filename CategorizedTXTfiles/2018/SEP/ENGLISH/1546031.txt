    Union Minister of State for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Chemical & Fertilizers, Shri Mansukh L Mandaviya today announced that the number of seafarers in the country has increased by over 60,000. He said, while only about 92, 000 people were engaged in ship related jobs, their number has gone up to 1,54,000 now.


    The Minister said, the government has taken steps to increase employment opportunities for the youth in this sector. The reforms under this include improving the sea farers examination. He said, while earlier only one to two per cent applicants could clear the said examination, with improved curriculum the pass percentage has gone up to 10 per cent now. This has resulted in more and more young people qualifying for jobs in the sector.


    Shri Mandaviya further said that rules and regulations have been strengthened for ensuring that students training to be seafarers get a chance to visit the sea during their training period. This, he said, will give them better exposure and prepare them well for jobs in the sector.
