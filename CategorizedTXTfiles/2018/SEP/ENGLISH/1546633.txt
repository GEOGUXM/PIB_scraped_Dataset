    General Duty Medical Officers (GDMOs) of the 3rd Foundation Training Programme, conducted by the National Institute of Health and Family Welfare, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, today ( September 19, 2018 ) at Rashtrapati Bhavan.


    Speaking on the occasion, the President was happy to note that the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has started the Foundation Training Programme for the General Duty Medical Officers of the Central Health Service to equip them to deal with multiple roles. He said that universal health coverage is a priority for our government. The rollout of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a critical step not just for the management of public health but for safeguarding our most precious asset â€“ our human capital.


    The President said that in the course of our development as a nation we have achieved significant milestones in the health sector. But a combination of old and new challenges lies before us. The disease burden in our country is undergoing an evolution. We have to tackle widespread diseases such as TB, malaria and dengue, and at the same time deal with the rising incidence of lifestyle diseases. Along with challenges of our disease burden, we have issues of delivery, access to services and affordability. The road before all of us is tough but not impossible to navigate. With dedication, drive and determination, we can do it.
