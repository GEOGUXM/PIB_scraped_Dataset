      Posted On: 25 APR 2018 12:51PM by PIB Mumbai


    In one of the major acquisition, NFAI has added 71 film prints in the 16mm format to its collection. A major highlight of this acquisition is that 50 out of the 71 titles are new additions to the NFAI collection, meaning that the films were not previously present with NFAI in any format. There are 66 colour films and 5 films from black and white era.


    Black-and-white Marathi films, consisting of “Warnecha Waagh (1970) – a film based on the novel by the same name by the renowned author Annabhau Sathe, ‘Sant Gora Kumbhar’ (1967) directed by Raja Thakur and written by G.D. Madgulkar; and ‘Kela Ishara Jaata Jaata’ (1965) directed by Anant Mane.


    The films in colour also include some key Marathi films by renowned filmmakers such as Dinkar Patil and Bhalji Pendharkar. V. Shantaram’s ‘Pinjara’ (1972) and ‘Chandanachi Choli, Ang Ang Jaali’ (1975), and other blockbusters like ‘Aaytya Bilawar Naagoba’ (1979), ‘Sulawarchi Poli’ (1980), ’Ganimi Kawa’ (1981), starring Dada Kondke, ‘Navri Mile Navryala’ (1984), ‘Gulchadi’ (1984), ‘Chambu Gabale’ (1989), ‘De Dhadak Bedhadak’ (1990), and ‘Pratikaar’ (1991).


    Mr. Prakash Magdum, Director, NFAI, said “This collection is important not only because of the titles in it but also because of the historical value of 16mm prints. In the times, when film theatres were the luxury of only cities, a parallel distribution system existed in the rural areas through 16mm prints. The distributors travelled to every small village and town, carrying the 16mm projectors and film prints and show films all night long on a white curtain. 16mm film prints were also the favourite of “touring talkies”, where the films would be shown in tents. Thus 16mm film prints have a very important role in making cinema reach far and wide”.


    16mm film distribution and exhibition has now become a very rare phenomenon in the advent of digital distribution of films. Very few 16mm film distributors exist today in rural areas. One such distributor is Anna Deshpande of Satara, who has been in this business for 50 plus years. He and his son Dinesh, have given the collection with them to NFAI so that an important part of the History of Indian Cinema can be preserved for the future generations to come.


    The acquisition also includes 29 Hindi films in this collection with titles like Amitabh Bachchan’ hits like Suhaag (1979), Andha Kanoon (1983) and Nastik (1983), classic romance drama Duje KeLiye (1981), Raj Kapoor’s Prem Rog (1982), successful and acclaimed ventures Ghayal (1990), Bol Radha Bol (1992), Virasat (1997) and cult comedy Andaz Apna Apna (1994).


    NFAI is proud to acquire these historical gems in the collection in the 16mm format.
