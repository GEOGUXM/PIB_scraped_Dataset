    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has said that sanitation coverage has expanded from about 40 percent in 2014, to about 80 percent today. He said toilet construction is ending social imbalances and is becoming a means of socio-economic empowerment and women empowerment. He described the mass movement of Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan as a phenomenon unparalleled anywhere in the world, in the 21st century.


    The Prime Minister expressed confidence that the resolve for Swachhta would write a new chapter of a clean and prosperous India. The Prime Minister said this in his address at the National Convention of Swachhagrahis at Motihari today. The event has been organized, as part of the centenary celebrations of the Satyagraha led by Mahatma Gandhi, in Champaran.


    It is worth recalling that a recently concluded independent verification of the progress under Swachh Bharat Gramin found that 93.4% of the households in rural India who have access to a toilet use it. The National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS) 2017-18 also re-confirmed the Open Defecation Free (ODF) status of 95.6% of villages which were previously declared and verified as ODF by various districts/states. The key findings of the Survey are depicted below.
