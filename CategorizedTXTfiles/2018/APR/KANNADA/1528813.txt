    Indian higher education system needs to reinvent itself to respond to the emerging challenges of a rapidly changing knowledge economy - Shri. M.VenkaiahNaidu, Hon’bleVicePresident of India


    Bangalore,April 12,2018


    The Indian higher education system needs to reinvent itself to respond to the emerging challenges of a rapidly changing knowledge economy, said Shri. M.VenkaiahNaidu, Hon’ ble Vice President of India in his Convocation address during the Twentieth Annual Convocation of the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, held here today.


    Mr. Naidu said t he demand for healthcare services in our country will undoubtedly be growing and when they treat a large volume of patients, the experience will broaden professional skills. If the healthcare professionals can keep updating their knowledge and skills by learning from the latest advances across the globe, they can certainly emerge as the leaders in their profession.


    He told those who were graduating that this is a transition time when they were at the threshold of becoming full-fledged healthcare professionals, ready to take on the real and continuous challenges that are going to become an integral part of their life.


    The Vice-President saidIndia has made rapid strides in the last two decades, with the proportion of people living in poverty falling by half. However, this period of rising prosperity has been marked by a “dual-disease burden”, a continuing rise in communicable diseases and a spurt in non-communicable or “lifestyle” diseases. We have to address both these health concerns, he said.


    Shri VajubhaiValaHon’ble Chancellor of the University & Governor of Karnatakaand Dr. M.K. Ramesh, Vice-Chancellor of the University were also present during the function.
