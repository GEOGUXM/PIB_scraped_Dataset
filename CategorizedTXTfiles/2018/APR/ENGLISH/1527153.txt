      Posted On: 01 APR 2018 7:17PM by PIB Delhi


    As per decision of the GST Council, e-Way Bill system became mandatory from today i.e. 01st April, 2018 for all inter-State movement of goods. The implementation of the nationwide e-Way Bill mechanism under GST regime is being done by GSTN in association with the National Informatics Centre (NIC) and is being run on portal namely https://ewaybillgst.gov.in.


    Heralding a paradigm shift in movement of goods from one State to another, trial run for e-way bills under the current GST regime was started on 16th January 2018 for the entire country.


    A total of 10,96,905 taxpayers have registered on e-Way Bill Portal till date. Further 19,796 transporters, who are not registered under GST, have enrolled themselves on the e-Way Bill Portal. 1,71,503 e-waybills have been successfully generated on the portal from 00:00 hours till 17:00 hrs of 1st April, 2018.


    To answer queries of taxpayers and transporters, the Central helpdesk of GST has made special arrangements with 100 agents exclusively dedicated to answer queries related to e-way bills.


    E-way Bill can be generated through various modes like Web (Online), Android App, SMS, using Bulk Upload Tool and API based site to site integration etc. Consolidated e-way Bill can be generated by transporters for vehicle carrying multiple consignments.


    Transporters can create multiple Sub-Users and allocate roles to them. This way large transporters can declare their various offices as sub-users.


    There is a provision for cancellation of e-way Bill within 24 hours by the person who has generated the e-way Bill. The recipient can also reject the e-way Bill within validity period of e-way bill or 72 hours of generation of the e-way bill by the consignor whichever is earlier.
