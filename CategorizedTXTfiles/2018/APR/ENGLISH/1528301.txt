    In order to boost Ease of doing Business in Indian Railways, Research Design & Standards Organization (RDSO) is keenly approaching Indian industry through Vendor meets being organized in various cities where senior officers of RDSO interact with the prospective vendors, educate them about the features and ease of using the new online vendor registration system.


    The first such vendor meet in coordination with Laghu Udyog Bharti, Rajkot was organized on 24.01.2018 at Rajkot in which Queries/Doubts from the around 200 vendors present were resolved on the spot by senior officials in a Question-Answer session. Similar Vendor meets have since been held at other cities such as Faridabad, Ludhiana, Sahibabad, Coimbatore, Pune and Noida on 22.02.2018, 07.03.2018, 09.03.2018, 15.03.2018, 04.04.2018 and 05.04.2018 respectively. The efforts are being very well appreciated by industry. Further such meets are planned in April and May 2018 at seven more places. Details are as under:-

    In this way, RDSO has opened up its arms to the Indian industry and poised itself as an industry friendly organisation. This has been very well received and appreciated by one and all.
