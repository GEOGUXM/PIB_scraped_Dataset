    Out of these 299, charge sheet has been filed in 107 cases (103 in 2015 and 4 in 2016). 3 cases resulted in conviction in 2015.


    The cases referred by Supreme Court are under active investigation. However, due to following reasons, time frame for filing Charge-sheets can not be fixed.


      * In some cases, investigation requires scrutiny of voluminous documents and examination of large number of witnesses.

      * In some cases, investigations has to be done in foreign countries for which Letters Rogatory has to be executed, which is a time consuming process
      * Many cases remain pending even after conclusion of investigation for want of sanction for prosecution from the competent authority or for want of expert opinion.
      * Large vacancies in CBI amongst the ranks of Investigating Officers and Law Officers affect the speed of investigations.
