      Posted On: 04 APR 2018 5:51PM by PIB Delhi


    There is a well established system of inspection of bridges on Indian Railways. All the bridges are inspected twice a year, one before the onset of monsoon and one detailed inspection after the monsoon. In addition, certain bridges are also inspected more frequently depending upon their condition. Repair / strengthening / rehabilitation / rebuilding of railway bridges is a continuous process and is undertaken whenever so warranted by their physical condition as ascertained during these inspections and not on the basis of age. If the corrective / remedial measures are expected to take a long duration due to the complexity of the site situation, etc., suitable safety measures like imposing speed restrictions and keeping such bridge under close watch are taken till the bridge is repaired / strengthened / rehabilitated / rebuilt. During last five year (2012-13 to 2016-17), a total of 3675 bridges have been repaired / strengthened / rehabilitated / rebuilt on Indian Railways. As on 01.04.2017, a total of 3017 railway bridges are sanctioned for repaired / strengthened / rehabilitated / rebuilt.
