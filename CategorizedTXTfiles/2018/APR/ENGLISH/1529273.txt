    The President of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), Shri Rashesh Shah called on the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy & Space, Dr Jitendra Singh, here today and discussed business and investment plans for Northeast.


    Shri Rashesh Shah referred to renewed focus on Northeast in the last three or four years ever since the Government took over and said that the entire business community and business trade organizations across the country are now looking forward to the Northeast for unexplored avenues. He said, the business community is particularly interested in tourism and agriculture sector, which has immense potential in the region.


    Dr Jitendra Singh suggested that FICCI should organize series of awareness programmes in the peripheral States of Jammu & Kashmir and Northeast to spread awareness both among the business community as well as consumers about the kind of investments and business ventures, most optimally suitable for each of the given regions. He particularly emphasized the need to promote young Start-ups and young entrepreneurs from across the country to come forward and invest in these areas.


    Shri Shah told Dr Jitendra Singh that very soon, FICCI will come out with a comprehensive proposal and plan in the form of a written document which would be the road- map for the best possible investments and industry initiatives in the times to come. He said that the FICCI will always look forward to Dr Jitendra Singh for continued support, as in the past.
