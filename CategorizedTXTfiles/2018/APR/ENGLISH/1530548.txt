      Clarification on estimates of Toilet Costs under Swachh Bharat Mission
      Posted On: 27 APR 2018 2:04PM by PIB Delhi


    It has come to the attention of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Swachh Bharat Mission, that some incorrect estimates of toilet costs constructed under SBM-G are being circulated on social media and reported in print and electronic media.


    This is to clarify that under the Swachh Bharat Mission - Gramin, each eligible beneficiary gets Rs. 12,000 as an incentive/subsidy to build a low cost but good quality household toilet. This centre and the state contribute to this incentive in the ratio of 60:40. The centre releases its share to the states, and it is the states who implement the program on the ground.


    While the average cost of a twin-pit leach pit toilet is about Rs. 12,000, it can vary based on local conditions. In some cases, the beneficiaries may also choose to spend more than just the government incentive in order to build even better quality toilets. Hence it is incorrect to suggest that the incentive is equivalent to the "cost of a toilet".


    Over 7 crore toilets have been constructed since the launch of the mission, and the sanitation coverage has more than doubled, from 39% in October 2014 to over 82% today.
