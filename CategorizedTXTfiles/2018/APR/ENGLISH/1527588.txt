    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the newly constructed Western Court Annexe in New Delhi. This building will serve as transit accommodation for Members of Parliament.


    Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister appreciated the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Smt. Sumitra Mahajan, for her efforts in the completion of this project. He added that Smt. Sumitra Mahajan always has the well-being of the MPs in mind. He said that her compassion is reflected in the attention to detail that has been given in this project.


    The Prime Minister said that the project has been completed well within the stipulated time and cost. He congratulated all those involved in the construction of the project.


    The Prime Minister said that when MPs are newly elected, they have to stay in hotels and this makes headlines. However, he said that what is often missed is that previous occupants overstay beyond the designated time.


    The Prime Minister asserted that the Union Government is walking on the path shown by Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar. At the core of Dr. Ambedkar's ideals is harmony and togetherness, he said. He added that working for the poorest of the poor is the Governmentâ€™s mission.


    The Prime Minister announced that the memorial to commemorate Babasaheb Ambedkar, at 26 Alipur Road in New Delhi, which was the place of Mahaparinirvana of Dr. Ambedkar, will be inaugurated on the 13 th of April - the eve of his birth anniversary. He condemned the politics being played by certain people, in the name of Dr. Ambedkar.
