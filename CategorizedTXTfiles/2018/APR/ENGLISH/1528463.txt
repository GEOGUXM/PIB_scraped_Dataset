      Posted On: 10 APR 2018 3:37PM by PIB Delhi


    The number of consequential train accidents have decreased during the current year i.e. from 01/04/2017 to 31/03/2018 to 73 as compared to 104 numbers during the corresponding period of last year.


    Indian Railways have planned to provide Automatic Train Protection (ATP) conforming to ETCS level-2 standards on the entire Indian Railway Broad Gauge (BG) network. This will provide technological aid to Loco Pilots for avoiding Signal Passing at Danger (SPAD) and over speeding. Presently, following different Automatic Train Protection (ATP) Systems are existing on Indian Railways:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
(i)    Automatic Train Protection (ATP) System based on proven European Train Control System (ETCS-L1) Technology has been implemented on 342 RKMs (200 RKMs Delhi-Agra Section, 117 RKMs Chennai Suburban section and 25 RKMs of Metro Railway, Kolkata).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
(ii)   An ATP called Auxiliary Warning System (AWS) is presently functional on 364 RKMs in the Mumbai suburban section of Central Railway (240 RKMs) and Western Railway (124 RKMs).                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
(iii)  An ATM system indigenously developed called Train Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) is under trial on 250 RKMs of South Central Railway as a pilot project.
