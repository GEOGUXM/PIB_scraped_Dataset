    The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) conducted table-top exercises at Tripura and Nagaland today (April 25, 2018), and at Mizoram yesterday (April 24, 2018). These exercises were held in the run-up to the mock exercise on earthquake preparedness to be held in these North Eastern States tomorrow (April 26, 2018).


    Concerned officers from all districts and stakeholder departments participated in the exercise. The districts confirmed that their Disaster Management Plans (DMPs) had been updated, Response Teams identified and other preparations for the exercise had been put in place. This was followed by presentations by various stakeholder departments.


    The table-top exercises were conducted based on scenarios created in collaboration with State Departments as per seismic mapping and other related hazards.


    Independent observers were briefed about their role and standard feedback forms were given to them. Sites for the mock exercise and administrative arrangements were finalised.


    Earlier, Coordination-cum-Orientation Conferences were also held to ensure the smooth facilitation of the mock exercise, which is being conducted by NDMA in collaboration with the State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs).


    The National Disaster Guidelines significantly focuses on Prevention, Mitigation and Preparedness for a disaster situation. In its efforts towards improving the management of a disaster situation, NDMA has so far conducted more than 600 mock exercises across the country on various disasters.
