    Supplementary nutrition to adolescent girls is being provided @ Rs. 9.5 per beneficiary per day under the Scheme for Adolescent Girls in all the States/UTs. The said rates are equivalent to the prescribed rates for nutrition for the pregnant and lactating mothers under Anganwadi Services of umbrella ICDS scheme. Earlier the nutrition @ Rs. 5 per beneficiary per day was being provided to Adolescent Girls. The Government issued instructions to provide adolescent girls a diet similar to pregnant and lactating mothers under the Scheme of Adolescent Girls.


    These cost norms have been revised under Scheme for Adolescent Girls keeping in view the recent price rise and Annual Cost Indexation and intimated to the State Government/ UT Administration. Government has also approved expansion and universalisation of the Scheme for Adolescent Girls in a phased manner and at present all the districts of the States/UTs are covered under the scheme.


    This information was given by Union Minister for Women and Child Development, Smt Maneka Sanjay Gandhi in reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
