    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed an ‘Asangathit Shramik Sammelan’ organised by the government of Madhya Pradesh in Guna today (April 29, 2018).


    Speaking on the occasion, the President said no society can progress without being mindful of the welfare of the working classes, the deprived and underprivileged sections. In the labour sector in India, the share of workers in the unorganised sector is over 80 per cent. Most of them are engaged in agriculture and construction. There is a great need for social security for these workers. The President said he was happy to note that the government of India is creating a ‘Social Security Code’ for workers in the unorganised sector. The government of Madhya Pradesh has also taken initiatives in this direction.


    Later in the day, the President addressed a function related to the ‘Mini Smart City Mission’ of the government of Madhya Pradesh in Guna. The President said that cities and urban centres make a huge contribution to India’s economy. That is why the government of India has launched the Smart Cities programme and is helping in the developing of selected cities. Of the 100 cities selected, seven are in Madhya Pradesh.


    The President said that the Madhya Pradesh government has taken a visionary decision to supplement the national initiative with a ‘Mini Smart City’ scheme at the state level. He said he was happy that Guna was a beneficiary of this initiative and was confident that it would open new pathways for the prosperity of the people of the town.
