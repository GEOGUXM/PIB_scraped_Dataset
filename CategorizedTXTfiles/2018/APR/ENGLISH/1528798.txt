    Bharat Ratna Baba Saheb Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was born on 14 th April 1891 at Mhow in Madhya Pradesh and was the First Law Minister of Independent India. After resigning from the Union Cabinet on 1 st November 1951, Dr. Ambedkar started residing in the house of Maharaja of Sirohi at 26, Alipur Road, Delhi where he breathed his last and attained Mahaparinirvana on 6 th December 1956. In the memory of Dr. Ambedkar, Dr. Ambedkar Mahaparinirvana Sthal, 26, Alipur Road was dedicated to the Nation by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the then Prime Minister of India on 2 nd December, 2003. The followers of Baba Saheb believe 26, Alipur Road as Holy place where he attained Mahaparinirvana. Since this building was to be constructed as a Memorial of Baba Saheb, who was the brain behind the Constitution of India, hence, the building has been given the shape of a book.
