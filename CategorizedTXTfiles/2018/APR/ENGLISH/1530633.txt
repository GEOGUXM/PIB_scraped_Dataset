    A five-day Day training programme, aimed at enhancing the preparedness of Airport Emergency Handlers (AEHs) to respond to CBRN emergencies at the airports, concluded today at the Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Airport in Patna. The training programme was conducted in collaboration with the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences (INMAS).


    CBRN emergencies pertain to threats emanating due to Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear material.


    During the training, NDMA jointly with the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) also conducted its first-ever full-scale Biological Management Emergency Exercise. The exercise was based on a suspected Ebola outbreak scenario. "Biological emergencies are extremely complicated to handle and require utmost expertise not only in handling the victims but also in screening them before they escape out in community", said Dr. Saurabh Dalal, NDMA.


    Shri Alok Kumar, Deputy Commandant, NDRF, said that mock drills with simulated situations of biological disasters are conducted by the NDRF regularly to fine tune the response mechanism in case of threats arising out of usage of biological agents.


    Stakeholders from several departments, including Airport Management, Health and Medical services, Customs, Immigration, Fire Services, State Disaster Management Authority and Disease Surveillance units participated in the mock exercise.


    Shri U. K. Mishra, Member, Bihar State Disaster Management Authority (BSDMA), Shri Vijay Sinha, Commandant, 9th Battalion, NDRF, Shri Pushkar Sahay, NDMA and Shri Rajender Singh Lahauria, Airport Director, Patna, attended the valedictory function and congratulated the participants.
