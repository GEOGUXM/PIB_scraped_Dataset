    The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has hailed the Prime Minister MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) as a revolutionary scheme and was aimed at empowering the neglected and underprivileged sections of the society. Interacting with the beneficiaries of the PMMY on the completion of three years of the launching of the scheme here today, the Vice President said that a record number of 12 crore beneficiaries have received loans under the scheme.


    The Vice President said that the main objective of the MUDRA Yojana was to make people stand on their own legs. A majority of those who received loans were from the underprivileged sections like fishermen, toddy tappers, weavers, goldsmiths, blacksmiths and others, he added.


    Emphasising the need to promote self-employment, the Vice President said that the government alone cannot provide employment to all people and such schemes will empower people to stand on their own feet. The Mudra Yojana will also help the entrepreneurs to get loans at cheaper interest rates, he added.


    The Vice President complimented the government for effectively implementing the scheme by creating awareness among the people.


    The Vice President said that this historic scheme will be beneficial to women as it will make them self-reliant without depending on their parents or husbands. Such schemes will not only empower the people, but also promote financial inclusion in an effective manner, he added.
