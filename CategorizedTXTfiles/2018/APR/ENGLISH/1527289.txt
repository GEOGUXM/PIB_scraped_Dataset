      Posted On: 02 APR 2018 6:10PM by PIB Delhi


    As per decision of the GST Council, e-Way Bill system became mandatory from 01 st April, 2018 for all inter-State movement of goods. The implementation of the nationwide e-Way Bill mechanism under GST regime is being done by GSTN in association with the National Informatics Centre (NIC) and is being run on portal namely https://ewaybillgst.gov.in .


    On day-1, total of 2.59 lakh e-Way Bills were generated on the e-way bill portal. Till 2:00 pm today, 2,04,563 e-way bills have been generated. A total of 11,18,292 taxpayers have registered on e-Way Bill Portal till date. Further 20,057 transportershave enrolled themselves on the e-Way Bill Portal.


    To assist and answer queries of taxpayers and transporters, the Central helpdesk of GST has made special arrangements with 100 agents exclusively dedicated to answer queries related to e-way bills. Separately, state tax authorities have started helpdesk in local language, details of which are available on the GST portal. Central as well as State Tax Authorities have declared Nodal Officers for e-way bills. Detailed FAQs are kept on the portal for the guidance of the users.


    E-way Bill can be generated through various modes like Web (Online), Android App, SMS, using Bulk Upload Tool and API based site to site integration etc. Consolidated e-way Bill can be generated by transporters for vehicle carrying multiple consignments.


    Transporters can create multiple Sub-Users and allocate roles to them. This way large transporters can declare their various offices as sub-users.


      There isa provision for cancellation of e-way Bill within 24 hours by the person who has generated the e-way Bill. The recipient can also reject the e-way Bill within validity period of e-way bill or 72 hours of generation of the e-way bill by the consignor whichever is earlier.
