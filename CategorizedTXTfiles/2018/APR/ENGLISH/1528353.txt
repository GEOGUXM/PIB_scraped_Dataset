These were Beur STP, Beur sewerage network, Saidpur STP and adjoining network and Karmalichak STP. The total awarded cost of these projects was Rs. 738.04 crore. They will create STP capacity of 140 MLD and lay 422.88 km of sewerage network in these sewerage zones of Patna.


    The above 11 projects in Patna worth Rs 3237.69 crore will create total of 350 MLD sewage treatment capacity and lay down 1140.26 km of sewerage lines. The expected sewage load for the city by 2035 is 320 MLD. Once these projects are completed, no sewage water from Patna will flow into river Ganga. These projects will ensure that no untreated water goes into Ganga in Patna and sewer lines reach every household in the town. Besides these, a total of 29 projects worth Rs 5042.11 crore are ongoing in Bihar under Namami Gange programme.
