      Posted On: 10 APR 2018 6:24PM by PIB Delhi


    Price Monitoring Cell in the Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA) is monitoring the retail and wholesale prices of 22 essential food commodities on a daily basis. These 22 commodities include five items groups i.e. Food grains (Rice, Wheat, Atta), Pulses (Gram, Tur, Urad, Moong, Masur), Edible Oils (Groundnut Oil, Mustard Oil, Vanaspati, Soya Oil, Sunflower Oil, Plam Oil), Vegetables (Potato, Onion, Tomato) and other items (Sugar, Gur, Milk, Tea, Salt). This is being done through 101 centres across the country.


    Price Monitoring Cell analyses the price situation and gives advance feedback for taking appropriate policy measures to prevent undesired shortfall in the availability of essential commodities.


    To enable wider spread and coverage of area for which prices are captured and as a follow up to the recommendation of Committee of Secretaries, this Department has developed and uploaded a software on its website for collecting prices of these 22 essential food commodities through crowd sourcing and stakeholder participation. The link of the website is: https://consumeraffairs.nic.in/pmc/ . Citizens, retail and wholesale businesses, Voluntary Consumer Organisations and all other stakeholders are invited to register on this portal and enter prices of their locality. Users will have to register only once on the portal to get user id and password instantly and enter prices of their locality.
