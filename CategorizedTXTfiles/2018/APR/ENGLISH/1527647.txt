    The exercise of NRC updation is being carried out as per the Citizenship (Registration of citizens and issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003. This work is being carried out in a fair and objective manner. The Honâ€™ble Supreme Court is monitoring this exercise.


    All available Electoral Rolls upto 1971 and 1951 NRC were digitized and made available in public domain, both online and offline, for the benefit of the public. As such, even in case of loss of documents by the public due to natural calamities etc., substantial data were available in public domain to enable them to submit their NRC application forms. No complaint has been received from any quarter to the effect that genuine Indian Citizens have not been able to apply for NRC due to loss of document in flood or any other natural calamities or non-availability of record.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
