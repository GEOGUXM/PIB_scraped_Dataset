    By using radiation induced mutagenesis along with cross breeding, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) has developed two mutants of rice {Trombay Raipur Rice-1(TRR-1), Trombay Konkan Kolam (TKKR-13)*} and one mutant of cowpea {Trombay Cowpea 901 (TC901)*} which are identified for release. BARC has also developed several mutants of groundnut, mustard, cowpea, blackgram, greengram, soybean, rice and wheat which are undergoing advance field trials in State Agricultural Universities. The major desirable traits in these crops include higher yield, seed size, improved agronomic and quality traits, early maturity and stress tolerance.


    The BARC developed mutant crop varieties have high patronage from the farming community and are extensively grown in different states of the country. Popularization is done by linkages established with State Agricultural Universities (through kisan mela, frontline demonstrations / exhibitions and awareness programmes).


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
