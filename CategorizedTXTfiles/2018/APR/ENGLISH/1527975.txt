      Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with France for boosting education
      Posted On: 05 APR 2018 7:10PM by PIB Delhi


    An Agreement to facilitate Mutual Recognition of Academic Qualifications between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the French Republic has been signed during the recent visit of French dignitaries to India.


    Signing of MoU with a foreign country is not a unilateral course of action and verily depends on various factors viz. education system prevailing in that country, response of the foreign country, bilateral relations, mutual benefit to be accrued by signing such kind of MOUs, etc. In some cases it can materialize soon whereas in other cases it may not materialize or take time. In other words, agreement with a country evolves during the course of negotiations and as such it cannot be predicted/planned in advance.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Dr. Satya Pal Singh today in a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question.
