    As per the Unified District Information System on Education (UDISE) 2015-16, there has been an increase in the enrollment of students in science subjects at higher secondary level from 62.18 lakh in 2014-15 to 79.52 lakh in 2015-16.


    The Centrally sponsored scheme of Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) envisages universalizing access to secondary schools by providing a secondary school within a reasonable distance (5 kilometer) of every habitation, improving quality of education through making all secondary schools conform to prescribed norms and removal of gender, socio-economic and disability barriers. Under the scheme, there is a provision of appointment of 1 Head Teacher and 5 Teachers (2 language teacher, 1 science teacher, 1 social science and 1 math teacher)for every new/upgraded secondary school and Additional teacher to improve pupil teacher ratio. However, the recruitment and service conditions of Government teachers are primarily in the domain of respective State governments and UT Administration.


    The Ministry of Human Resource Development has also in 2015 launched the Rashtriya Avishkar Abhiyan (RAA), a convergent framework across School Education and Higher Education to encourage children towards learning Science and Mathematics and to develop their interest through activities related to Science and Mathematics. One of the interventions under RAA is strengthening of Science and Mathematics laboratories in schools, through the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA). Also other interventions such as Science Fair/Exhibition and Talent Search at district level; mathematics and science kits to schools, visit to higher institutions of students and learning enhancement of students are also approved.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Shri Upendra Kushwaha today in a written reply to a Lok Sabha question.
