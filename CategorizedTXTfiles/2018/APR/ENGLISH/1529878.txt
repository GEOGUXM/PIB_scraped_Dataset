A total of 3,55,604 applications had been received for Haj which included 1,89,217 male and 1,66,387 female applicants.


    This year, a total of 1,28,002 pilgrims will go through Haj Committee of India which include about 47 per cent females. 47,023 Haj pilgrims will go through Private Tour Operators.
