Front line staffs deployed on trains are also trained in rendering First Aid. The Station Masters of all stations have details of doctors, clinics and hospitals, both Government and Private, in the vicinity of the station, so that their services could also be availed, in emergencies. Ambulance services of both Railway hospitals and State Governments are utilized when required.


    A pilot project of deployment of doctors in Duronto Trains was undertaken for a period of two years. During the Pilot Project, it was noted that serious patient could not be treated on board and had to be de-trained for medical treatment at a hospital only because the medical equipments, such as ECG machines etc. do not function properly on the trains due to noise/ vibration etc.


    The issue of rendering Medical Assistance/ First Aid to the passengers was examined by Honâ€™ble Supreme Court and it was ordered that a committee of experts be constituted by All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi and recommendations of the committee be implemented by Ministry of Railways. Accordingly, the recommendations of the committee were obtained and have been implemented.
