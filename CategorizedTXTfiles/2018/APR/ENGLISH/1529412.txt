    Giriraj Singh MoS MSME emphasized the need for more agro clusters under the MSME Ministry for job creation. He said it is quite alarming that women are losing employment and are forced to migrate to cities. To minimize both unemployment and migration, the Minister said that the agro-clusters can act as catalyst for creation of more jobs in rural India especially for women.


    The Minister was delivering the valedictory address at the end of the two-daysâ€™ Conference of Development Institutes, Technology Centres and Tool Rooms under the Ministry of MSME. The Minister also desired that wide publicity should be given to the successful ventures of MSME Ministry like clusters and tool rooms so that many more may be set-up in the country.


    The Minister further added that the schemes under MSMEs in different Ministries should reach the village level for which he urged the Development Institutes to coordinate with district functionaries.
