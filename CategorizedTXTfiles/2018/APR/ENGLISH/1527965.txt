    IIT Madras offers Online-interactive M.Tech Programme to be pursued from the workplace. Candidates from those industries, which are approved by IIT Madras and have necessary infrastructure to support the programme, are eligible to apply. Selection is done through test/interview and those selected register for courses, attend classes regularly through online, two-way connectivity and earn credits. Examinations are conducted by the Institute and necessary supervision and evaluation is done by the IIT faculty. Candidates earning required credits are awarded degrees. There is no difference between the degrees awarded to regular students and those pursuing it from their workplaces. Candidates can use the Institute Labs for performing experiments, if the curriculum so demands. In cases where the curriculum is designed for a particular industry wherein the candidates are already familiar with the practical aspects, the laboratory is not insisted in the curriculum. However, all enrolled candidates make at least one visit spanning a week-end for interaction with the course teachers.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Dr. Satya Pal Singh today in a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question.
