    Data pertaining to decennial census, large scale sample surveys conducted by National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) and various other surveys conducted by different Ministries / Departments of Government of India, reveal that over the years there have been vast improvements in living conditions of the Scheduled Tribes (STs), for example, literacy rate for STs has improved from 47.1% in 2001 to 59% in 2011. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) for ST students at Senior Secondary (classes XI-XII) level has increased from 35.4% in 2013-14 to 43.1% in 2015-16. During 2015, 64.1 % and 68.9 % ST students have completed Class Xth and XIIth, respectively, through various State and Central Examination Boards including Open Boards. In respect of Scheduled Tribes, Infant Mortality Rate has declined from 62.1 (2005-06) to 44.4 (2015-16), Under Five Mortality Rate has declined from 95.7 (2005-06) to 57.2 (2015-16), and Institutional Delivery has increased from 17.7% in 2005-06 to 68.0 % in 2015-16. As per the estimates of erstwhile Planning Commission, percentage of ST people living below the poverty line in rural areas has declined from 47.4% in 2009-10 to 45.3% in 2011-12. However, there are still gaps in human development indicators between STs and all India population.
