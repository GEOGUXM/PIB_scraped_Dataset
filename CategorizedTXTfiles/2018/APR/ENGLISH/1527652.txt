      Modern Weapons to Tackle Terrorist and Naxalite activities
      Posted On: 04 APR 2018 5:43PM by PIB Delhi


    Modernisation of Police Forces is a continuous process and their requirement of modern weapons keeps evolving over time. The Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) are provided with latest state-of-the-art weapons as per their requirement to tackle the terrorist and naxalite activities in the country. For further modernisation of the CAPFs, a Modernisation Plan-II for CAPFs is under implementation.


    So far as State Police Forces are concerned, they are primarily the responsibility of the States. However, the Government of India supplements the efforts of State Governments by providing central assistance to strengthen police infrastructure. To equip the security system with state-of-the-art technology in view of the increasing terrorist and naxalite activities in the country, the Government has approved an enhanced outlay under the umbrella scheme of “Modernisation of Police Forces (MPF)” with a total outlay of Rs. 25,061 crore. Under this umbrella scheme, a sub-scheme of “Assistance to States for Modernization of Police” with an outlay of Rs. 7,380 crore has been approved for the period from 2017-18 to 2019-20. This sub-scheme is in continuation of the scheme of Modernisation of State Police Forces. Under this sub-scheme central assistance to States is provided for acquisition of security/surveillance/communication equipments, modern weaponry, forensic equipments etc.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hanraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
