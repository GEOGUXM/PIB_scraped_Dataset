    Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) transferred eight technologies to seven industries from private and public sector in the presence of Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman during DefExpo India – 2018 at Thiruvidanthai, Kancheepuram district on the East Coast Road near Chennai, today. The spectrum of products include missiles, torpedoes, grenades, sonars, sonar dome, gas turbine technologies and Identification of Friend and Foe (IFF) systems.


    This occasion saw the symbolic handing over of the total accrued Transfer of Technology (ToT) fee of Rs 192 crore by Chairman DRDO & Secretary, Department of Defence R&D Dr. S Christopher to Raksha Mantri arising from 290 ToTs by DRDO to industries from 2015 to till date. A record number of 112 ToTs were executed in 2017 and a record ToT fee of Rs 158 crore has accrued in this year alone till date, breaking all previous records.


    This will provide a major boost to the "Make-In-India" programme envisioned by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. Following three products were handed over to the Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Sunil Lanba by Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman:-

      * Processor based Moored Mines
      * Advanced VLF Modulator & De-Modulator

    The Light Combat Aircraft - Tejas, which is designed and developed by ADA – a autonomous society of DRDO was amongst the major product that found mention during the function. So was BrahMos missile, the major sub systems of which were indigenized and developed in line with Make in India by DRDL, a laboratory of DRDO, and productionized as well as marketed by BrahMos Aerospace Limited, a joint venture of DRDO and NPOM, Russia.


    To celebrate sixty years of its existence, DRDO has had a number of events to commemorate the celebrations such as outreach programmes for industry and S&T in schools & colleges, S&T exhibitions, Cyber Challenge, Public Lectures by Young Scientists, National Level Essay Competition and Skill India initiatives.


    A commemorative postal stamp designed by the Department of Post & Telegraph was released on the occasion to honour DRDO scientists, both past and present, who have contributed in the 60 year journey of making India self-sufficient and self-reliant in Defence technologies and systems.
