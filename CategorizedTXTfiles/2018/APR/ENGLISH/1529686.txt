    The Group of Ministers on Transport constituted by the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has recommended a uniform structure of road tax for vehicles across states. In its meeting held in Guwahati today, the GoM observed that a uniform tax structure will put a check on people registering their vehicles in low tax states and running them in other states. This would also bring necessary relief to genuine cases requiring transfer of vehicles.


    The GoM, headed by Shri Yunus Khan, Minister for Transport, Rajasthan and comprising State Transport Ministers, seeks to find solutions to the various problems plaguing the road transport sector in the country so as to improve road safety and facilitate ease of transport. Todayâ€™s meeting in Guwahati, inaugurated by Assam Chief Minister Shri SarbanandaSonowal,was held to deliberate upon One Nation- One Tax and One Nation- One Permit proposal.


    The GoM has also recommended a national bus and taxi permit on lines of such permit for goods transport. Public transport in the country is growing annually at a rate of just about 2 percent, as against a 20 percent annual growth in private transport. A national permit will give the much needed fillip to public transport and help reduce road congestion and its attendant problems.


    In order to promote alternate fuel for vehicles the GoM had proposed liberalization of permit system for electric vehicles. In addition, it has recommended raising the tax on diesel vehicles by 2 percent while lowering the tax on electric vehicles.
