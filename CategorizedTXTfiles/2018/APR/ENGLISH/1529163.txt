    The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has congratulated India’s contingent at the 2018 Commonwealth Games.


    “India's contingent at the 2018 Commonwealth Games has made every Indian extremely proud. All our sportspersons gave their best and played very well. I congratulate all those athletes who are bringing back medals.


    Every athlete who represented India at 2018 Commonwealth Games inspires us. Their life stories illustrate the power of dedication and a never-say-die attitude that made them overcome countless hurdles to attain the heights of success they did at the CWG.


    I hope India’s success at 2018 Commonwealth Games motivates more youngsters to pursue sports and creates larger awareness on the importance of fitness in everyone’s lives.


    On our part, we in the Government are doing everything possible to strengthen the FitIndia movement”, the Prime Minister said in a series of tweets.
