    The construction targets for 2018-19 have been set at 16,420 km, of which 9700 km will be constructed by MoRTH, 6000 km by NHAI and 720 km by NHIDCL. 9829 kilometres length of National Highways were constructed during 2017-18. Per day construction target has been set at 45 km for the current year, against last year’s about 27 km per day.


    Shri Gadkari said, his Ministry is making all out efforts for improving and strengthening the Highways network in the country. This year the focus would be more on construction, but the award would be more than last year. There will also be focus on completing the DPRs of all the “Ïn Principle” declared NHs.


    Shri Gadkari held a review meeting of officials of his Ministry today in which the state wise status of projects were reviewed. He said that yearly targets should be divided into Quarterly Targets so that there is no pressure at the end of the year. Chairman NHAI has created a Monitoring Group under him to complete ongoing projects. A similar group is being created in the Ministry.
