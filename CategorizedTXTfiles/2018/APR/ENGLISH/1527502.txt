    Government, vide order dated 05.01.2016 decided to reserve 33% posts at Constable level for being filled up by women in CRPF & CISF to begin with and 14-15% posts at Constable level in border guarding forces i.e. BSF, SSB & ITBP. This reservation is horizontal. Forces have not reported any special Recruitment Drive on this account. However, while indenting vacancies for recruitment to the post of constable (GD), the vacancies for women are duly intimated separately.


    The promotion is given based on the availability of vacancies and as per provisions made in the Recruitment Rules of various ranks. To increase the promotion avenues in lower ranks 34,992 posts of Constable/Rifleman have been upgraded to the rank of Head Constable/Havildar in CAPFs/ARs.
