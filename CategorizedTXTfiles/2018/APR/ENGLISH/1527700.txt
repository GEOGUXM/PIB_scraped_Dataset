      Posted On: 04 APR 2018 7:18PM by PIB Delhi


    Coal is the prime source of energy in India and as per draft “National Energy Policy” prepared by NITI Aayog, coal will remain as an important source of energy and electricity even in near future due to abundance of coal in India and that too at a cheaper rate.


    The total number coal mines in Coal India Ltd. (CIL),Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL), Public and Private Sectors as on 31.03.2017 and total annual production from these mines during 2016-17 is given below:


    (Million Tonnes)

    Production of coal during the last three years is given below:


    (Million Tonnes)

    In the year 2017-18, against the pro-rata AAP target (Apr-Feb’18) of 408.6 MT in CIL, supply of about 411.3 MT coal is been made to power sector thereby achieving materialization of 101% during the period.


    CIL has taken the following measures to improve the work efficiency of coal mines:


    i. Planning for higher capacity mines with heavy mechanization to take advantage of economy of scale.


    ii. Introduction of state of the art technology to improve its work efficiency with high capacity HEMMS like 42 cum shovel with 240T Rear Dumper.


    iii. Introduction of Surface Miners in opencast mines to improve operational efficiency & cater to environmental needs.


    iv. Introduction of In-pit crushing & conveying/in pit conveying.


    v. Introduction of mechanized mass production technology like powered support long wall technology and continuous miner in UG mines.


    vi. Thrust on mechanization of coal winning/loading system by gradually phasing out manual loading by SDL/LHD loading, manual drilling into UDM drilling, haulage system of transport to conveyor system wherever feasible.


    vii. Construction of silos with rapid loading system for faster loading.


    viii. For survey/check measurements, use of technology like Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS).


    With a view to optimize transportation cost, an inter-Ministerial Task Force (IMTF) was constituted by Ministry of Coal for a comprehensive review of existing coal sources as also feasibility for rationalization of these sources. The IMTF recommended rationalization of existing sources on case to case basis for 19 Thermal Power Plants (TPPs) of Public Sector Undertakings(PSUs). This has resulted in rationalization of sources of 24.238 MT of coal. In addition, an agreement was signed between Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Ltd. (GSECL) and National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) for swapping of 1.0 MT of domestic coal with imported coal. Further, CIL has rationalized sources of coal supply to TPPs of PSUs to the tune of 30.46 MT on the basis of the requests received from them. These have resulted in annual potential savings of Rs.3354 cr. Further, Government has permitted flexibility in utilization of domestic coal by allowing central/state utilities to use coal in such power plants to achieve overall reduction in cost of generation.


    In addition to the above, it has been decided that all Power Plants located within 20 km from Pithead shall construct elevated closed belt conveyor within next 2 years (up to 1 st April 2020). Further, it is also decided that the power plants located within 40km from Pit-head shall construct MGR within 3 years (up to 1 st April 2021). Power plants located beyond 40 km and up to 100 km, may also consider the option of MGR depending on the financial viability.


    This information was laid in the House today in response to a question in Lok Sabha.
