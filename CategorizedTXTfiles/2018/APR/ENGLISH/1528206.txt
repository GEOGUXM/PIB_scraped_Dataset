    After due diligence the officials of National Informatics Centre (NIC) have confirmed that Ministry of Defence and any other website hosted in the NIC data centre have not been hacked and there had been no cyber attack of any nature. The site showed what appeared to be a Chinese character and it was understandable that the site was perceived to be hacked . However, it has since been identified that the sites have not been hacked. Since late afternoon today, due to a technical issue in storage, about 10 Government websites hosted in the NIC data centre became inaccessible to the public. The website of Ministry of Defence , MHA , Department of public enterprises, Election commission, EPFO, Ministry of Labor, Department of Science & Technology have since been up & running. The NIC team further assured the citizens that services would be restored soon for any other websites if they are facing any problems.
