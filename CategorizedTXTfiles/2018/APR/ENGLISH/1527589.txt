Meteorological satellite                     2
                                              
                                              
                                              
Science Satellite                            1
                                              
                                              
                                              
Technology Demonstration/ Student Satellite  9
                                              
                                              

    Communication satellites carried communication transponders in different frequency bands of C, Extended C, Ku, Ka and S-band for telecommunication, broadcast and mobile communication services.


    Navigation satellites were part of the indigenous constellation NavIC, Indiaâ€™s own regional navigation system. Navigation satellites carried navigation payloads in L and S-bands for providing position, navigation and timing services.


    Earth Observation satellites are used for deriving inputs for Natural Resource Management, Disaster Management, Cartographic Applications, Weather, Climate and Ocean Studies.


    Astrosat (Science payload) is a unique multi wavelength observatory in space. It provides an opportunity for observation of celestial sources in Ultra-Violet, Optical and X-ray wavelength bands.


    ISRO has launched satellites for Technology demonstration and student satellites to encourage young generation to work in the field of space.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
