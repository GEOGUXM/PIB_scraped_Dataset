    The Government has taken several measures to enhance the quality of Indian Textiles to international standards. The steps taken include the Amended Technology Up-gradation Fund Scheme (A-TUFS), launch of India Handloom Brand and integrated scheme for development of silk industry. This information was given by Minister of State of Textiles Shri Ajay Tamta in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today. He said that the Amended Technology Up-gradation Fund Scheme provides for capital investment subsidy to facilitate technology upgradation in the weaving, processing, garmenting and technical textiles sectors for enhancement of quality in the textile manufacture. The India Handloom Brand is aimed at providing quality assurance for handloom products for safeguarding the interests of buyers in the domestic and international markets.


    The MoS Textiles further said that the Integrated Scheme for Development of Silk industry supports production of bivoltine silk, provides automatic reeling machines and also supports R&D to evolve new silk products. The power loom sector under the PowerTex India scheme provides support for upgradation of looms, creation of infrastructure (worksheds), setting up of yarn banks and support for pre-weaving and post-weaving facilities. The Textiles Committee operates 19 testing labs to test textile products for conformance to national and international standards. In the Jute Sector, the jute Industry conforms to specifications approved by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), in the manufacture of jute sacking
