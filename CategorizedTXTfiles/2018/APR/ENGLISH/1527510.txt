      Posted On: 03 APR 2018 6:53PM by PIB Delhi


    The Central Board for Secondary Education has taken the considered decision not to hold re-examination of Class-X maths paper even in Delhi-NCR and Haryana. Therefore the class-X math re-examination will not be held anywhere in the country. Earlier on 30 th March, 2018, the CBSE issued a notification stating that re-examination of class-X would be conducted in Delhi-NCR and Haryana if considered necessary after inquiry.


    The Board has said that internal inquiries and analysis based on available material and inputs from the ongoing police investigations are indicating that the alleged leak may be confined to a few alleged beneficiaries. Similarly, the trend of random evaluation done so far for class X Mathematics paper is not indicating sudden spikes or unusual patterns, giving any impression of passing on widespread benefits of alleged leaks to students. Further, the board has come across several fake question papers being put up on social media, obviously with a view to spread panic amongst our students, parents and schools.


    Meanwhile, Board is constantly receiving representation from stakeholders indicating anxiety amongst of class X due to the uncertainty surrounding the Maths examination. Also, it has received over 1000 calls on our Counselling Helpline Desk enquiring about whether the re-examination will be held and requesting for announcing the dates for the reconduct of Maths Class X examination.


    Keeping in mind the paramount interest of students, the Board has taken the considered decision to not hold the re-examination of Class X Maths paper even in Delhi NCR and Haryana, wherever it is conclusively established, after due enquiry in specific cases, that undue advantage of the alleged leakage has been taken by beneficiaries, action shall be taken as per the provisions of CBSE Examination Bye Laws.
