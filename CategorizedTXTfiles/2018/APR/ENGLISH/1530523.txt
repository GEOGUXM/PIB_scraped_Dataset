    The Union Minister of Railways & Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal inspected Coaches with new colour scheme along with Minister of State of Youth Affairs & Sports (Independent Charge), and Minister of State of Information & Broadcasting Colonel Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore on 25.04.2018 at New Delhi Railway Station. Chairman Railway Board, Shri Ashwani Lohani , Member Rolling Stock, Railway Board, Shri Ravindra Gupta and General Manager, Northern Railway Shri Vishwesh Chaube were also present on the occasion.


    Ministry of Railways is considering modifying the exterior color scheme of Integral Coach Factory (ICF) designed conventional coaches running in Mail & Express trains to give them more vibrant and pleasing look. Accordingly, as per direction of Railway Board, Northern Railway painted 7 different color schemes on ICF designed sleeper coaches. These vibrant and innovative color schemes were developed, jointly by National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad and Railways.


    After the inspection, it was decided to try out one color scheme with mix of fawn and Teak shade after some improvements. This new color scheme will be first tried out in limited number of coaches on trial basis and based on the feedback. Further proliferation on larger number of ICF designed coaches shall be considered thereafter. Indian Railways is already taking measures to upgrade the interiors of coaches, especially toilets through schemes like Upgrade to Swarn Standard for its premium service like Rajdhanis and Shatabdis, thus passengers can expect a complete makeover of coaches for a more pleasing travel experience in near future.
