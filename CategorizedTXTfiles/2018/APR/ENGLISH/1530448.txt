    The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) held a Consultation on development of Preventive Strategy on Child Sexual Abuse today. It was chaired by Smt. Stuti Kacker, Chairperson, NCPCR. She expressed her concern about growing incidents of sexual abuse of very young children in the country. Sh. Yashwant Jain, Member, NCPCR and Dr. Rajesh Sagar from AIIMS were also present in this consultation.


    It was strongly recommended in the consultation that a comprehensive and holistic campaign in rural and urban areas should be initiated at national level on Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) and on violation of Child Rights caused by it.


    NCPCR had carried out a crowd sourcing of suggestions for preventive measures against Child Sexual Abuse (CSA). 153 suggestions were received of which 70 suggestions were for awareness generation. They were deliberated upon in the meeting with representatives from different NGOs working in Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, and Chennai. There was also a presentation of a Media Campaign which covered various aspects of child sexual abuse and suggested measures that would be taken through their 360Â° media campaign.


    Child Sexual Abuse is a multidimensional problem having legal, social, medical and psychological implications. Preventive measures include creating awareness among children, general public and making parents more conscious, responsive, friendly and communicative with children and empowering and educating children about these issues. At the same time, we should have stringent implementation of law with zero tolerance approach towards such crimes.
