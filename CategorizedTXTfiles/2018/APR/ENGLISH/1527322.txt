    The University Grants Commission (UGC) has an Inter University Centre (IUC) called INFLIBNET (Information and Library Network). The Shodhganga@INFLIBNET centre is a repository of Ph.D theses across the nation. This Centre provides a platform for researchers to deposit their Ph.D theses and make them available to the entire scholarly community in open access.


    The number of Ph.D students has been on the rise and as per All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) data for 2016-17, the number of students enrolled is 141037 in various disciplines including Agriculture, Arts, Commerce, Computer Science/Applications, Education, Engineering/ Technology, Law, Management, Medicine, Science, Veterinary Science and others.


    Research is one of the important factors determining the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs).
