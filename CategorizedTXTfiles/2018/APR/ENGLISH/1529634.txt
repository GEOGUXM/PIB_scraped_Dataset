    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:


         1. Crude oil production by ONGC during March, 2018 was 1879.17 TMT which is 6.6% lower than the monthly target and 2.71% lower when compared with March, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-March, 2017-18 was 22249.12 TMT which is 3.56% lower than target for the period but marginally higher by 0.14% than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production with respect to target are as under:

      * Additional production planned from WO16 cluster from October’17 onwards could not be realized due to delay in implementation of “Conversion of Sagar Samrat to MOPU” Project.
      * Production planned from project ‘Integrated Development of B-127 Cluster’ from Oct.’17 onwards could not be realized due to delay in implementation of project. Production targeted by pre-monsoon of 2018 from B-127 wells.
      * NBP field of Western offshore which was affected due to ESP related issues was normalized by 15.02.2018 through rig intervention.
      * Increase in water cut in wells of Heera, Neelam and B-173 fields.
      * Frequent power shutdowns and low gas injection pressure in Mehsana and Assam hampered artificial lift operations.
      * Increase in water cut in Mehsana and Assam.

         1. Crude oil production by OIL during March, 2018 was 281.53 TMT which is 11.32% lower than monthly target and 3.98% lower when compared with March, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-March, 2017-18 was 3376.28 TMT which is 9.58% lower than target for the period but 3.63% higher than production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * Less than planned contribution from old wells – Rise in water cut in wells and decline in total liquid production of wells of Greater Hapjan and Greater Chandmari Fields.

      * Less than planned contribution from work over wells.

         1. Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during March, 2018 was 880.96 TMT which is 2.43% lower than the monthly target but 1.74% higher than March, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-March, 2017-18 was 10058.94 TMT which is 5.38% lower than target for the period and 4.5% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * RJ-ON-90/1 (CIL): Around 85 oil wells closed due to various reasons like high water cut, requiring WOJ, etc; Underperformance of Bhagyam.

      * CY-ONN-2002/2 (ONGC): Full fledged production yet to be realized owing to non-grant of PML.

    Natural Gas

     1. Natural gas production during March, 2018 was 2782.61 MMSCM which is 11.12% lower than the target for the month but 1.18% higher when compared with March, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production during April-March, 2017-18 was 32649.30 MMSCM which is 7.07% lower than target for the period but 2.36% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II . Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of March, 2018 and cumulatively for the period April-March, 2017-18 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

Reasons for shortfall in production during month are as under:


      * Less gas production from WO16 cluster and no production from B127 Cluster due to delay in implementation of ‘Conversion of Sagar Samrat to MOPU’ and ‘Integrated Development of B-127 Cluster’ project respectively.

      * Delay in commencement of production planned from sub-sea wells in Eastern Offshore.

         1. Natural gas production by OIL during March, 2018 was 236.73 MMSCM which is 4.55% lower than the monthly target and 5.69% lower than March, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-March, 2017-18 was 2881.50 MMSCM which is 3.96% lower than the cumulative target and 1.87% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * Outage of three high producing gas wells of Deohal and Naholia area due to down hole problems.

      * Frequent loading problem of BCPL’s Madhuban Compressor.

         1. Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during March, 2018 was 532.28 MMSCM which is 21.41% lower than the monthly target but 1.01% higher when compared with March, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-March, 2017-18 was 6338.34 MMSCM which is 20.03% lower than the cumulative target and 7.77% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

    Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production


         1. CPSE Refineries’ production during March, 2018 was 12526.86 TMT which is 2.42% lower than the target for the month but 3.19% higher when compared with March, 2017. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-March, 2017-18 was 145233.80 TMT which is 3.5% higher than the target for the period and 5.71% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


     1. IOCL, Paradip: Throughput lower due to refinery M&I shutdown in Mar’18, originally planned in Jul-Aug'17.

     2. NRL, Numaligarh: Shutdown taken in the crude processing unit to install new exchangers, replacement of HGO product cum CR pump, etc.

    3.2 Production in JV refineries during March, 2018 was 1534.05 TMT which is 4.5% higher than the target for the month and 13.82% higher when compared with March, 2017. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-March, 2017-18 was 15538.10 TMT which is 2.22% higher than the target for the period but 7.96% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year.


    3.3 Production in private refineries during March, 2018 was 7059.82 TMT which is lower by 8.82% than the target for the month and 9.78% lower when compared with March, 2017. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-March, 2017-18 was 91162.93 TMT which is 0.75% higher than the target for the period and marginally higher by 0.08% than the production during corresponding period of last year.


    3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of March, 2018 and cumulatively for the period April-March, 2017-18 vis-à-vis April-March, 2016-17 are given at Annexures - IV and V respectively.
