    The University Grants Commission (UGC) vide its letter dated 21 st March, 2017 has requested all the Universities to introduce identification mechanisms like photograph and Unique ID/Aadhaar number in students’ certificates. Such features are useful for the purposes of verification and curbing duplication. At the same time, they help in introducing uniformity and transparency within and across the system of higher education in the Country. UGC has also requested all the Universities to inscribe the name of institution in which a student is enrolled for a program of study as well as the mode of delivery (regular, part-time or distance). A copy of the letter dated 21 st March, 2017 is available at http://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/8481300_UGC-letter-reg-identification-mechanisms-(2).pdf .


    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Dr. Satya Pal Singh today in a written reply to a Lok Sabha question.
