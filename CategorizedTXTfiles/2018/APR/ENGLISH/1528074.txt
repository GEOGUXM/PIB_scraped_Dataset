    The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has said women are the catalysts of change in our society. Addressing the gathering after giving away the Young Women Achievers Awards 2017-18, organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), here today, Shri Rajnath Singh said a country cannot rise if half its population remains unequal. No force can stop India’s emergence as a developed country with such a vast capable, efficient and talented women workforce, he added.


    Citing the provision of 33% reservation for women in the Police Forces, the Union Home Minister said their representation in the CAPFs is increasing at a fast pace now. He said the Government has effected several structural and procedural changes to encourage women entrepreneurship. Shri Rajnath Singh said the Government has directed maximum institutional financing facilitating loan approvals for Women, Dalits, Backward and weaker sections. With women empowerment, a New India will emerge in five years, he added.
