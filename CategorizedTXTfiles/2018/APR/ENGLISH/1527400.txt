    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, planted a Baobab sapling in the gardens of Rashtrapati Bhavan today (April 3, 2018). This sapling was gifted by the University of Madagascar as a gesture of goodwill in return for the Neem tree that the President planted at the University campus in Antananarivo during his State visit to Madagascar in March.


    The Baobab tree has a life span of over 2000 years. It is high in medicinal and nutritional properties, quite like the Neem tree. The exchange of these plants spotlights the value both India and Madagascar attach to traditional knowledge and medicine in their respective cultures.
