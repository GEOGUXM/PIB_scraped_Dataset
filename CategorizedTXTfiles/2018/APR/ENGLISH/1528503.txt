    The new Website and Mobile App of the ‘National Commission for Safai Karamcharis’ was launched by Shri Thaawarchand Gehlot, Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment here today in the presence of the Chairman, Members and other officers of the Department and the Commission. The Minister congratulated the Commission for its new website and expressed hope that the new website and Mobile App will help the Commission in addressing the grievances/complaints of petitioners in an efficient manner.


    The erstwhile website of the National Commission for Safai Karamcharis was not user-friendly. On the advice of the Department of Social Justice and Empowerment, the Commission undertook the task of preparing a new website for itself. The new website is very user-friendly and as per Government of India Guidelines for official websites. It is a comprehensive website giving complete details about the Commission viz. its composition, mandate, manner of filing complaints, details of visits undertaken by its Chairman and Members, etc. The petitioners can file their grievances/complaints, etc. on-line on the website and thereafter track their grievances/complaints. Simultaneously, the petitioner can also lodge their grievances/complaints through their android mobile phones by using the Commission’s App which can be downloaded from the Google Play Store free of cost.
