      Posted On: 02 APR 2018 1:21PM by PIB Delhi


    MGNREGS programme made very significant progress in 2017-18, contributing to livelihood security through durable assets with full transparency using IT/DBTand geo-tagging of each and every asset created under the programme. The Table below from NREGASoft MIS captures the salient features of the performance of the programme over the last five years:

    * Figures of FY 2017-18 are provisional as data uploading for March’18 will continue up to 20th April, 2018.


    The table clearly brings out remarkable progress made in generating payment within 15 days from a low of 26.85% in 2014-15 to 85.75% in 2017-18. The total expenditure of Rs.63,887 crore in 2017-18, is nearly Rs. 25,000 crore more than what was spent in 2013-14. Likewise, for livelihood security and durable assets, thrust on expenditure on agriculture and allied works can be seen with the percentage rising from 48.7% in 2013-14 to 68.46% this year.


    The criticism of the MGNREGS was that works remain incomplete for a long time leading to poor quality assets and unsatisfactory livelihood security. The thrust on completion of works over the last two financial years led to the completion of nearly 1.20 crore assets in 2016-17 and 2017-18 which is nearly equal to what was being completed in four years. Geo tagging of MGNREGA assets which started on 1 st September, 2016 is going on with around 80,000 assets being geo tagged on daily basis. More than 2.84 crore assets out of a total of 3.34 completed assets since inception of the programmes have been geotagged and put in public domain.


    The Institute of Economic Growth Study (2017) on Natural Resource Management, found beneficiaries saying that 76% assets created were good/very good and only 0.5% was unsatisfactory. The thrust on completion shall continue. Governance reforms have been the hallmark of MGNREGS over the last three years with use of IT/DBT, and geo-tagging effectively. The verification of Job Cards and efforts to provide a Job Card to every deprived household as per the Socio Economic Census-2011 has yielded very positive results. As the table above indicates 96.31% of expenditure is now through Electronic Fund Management System as against 37.13% in 2013-14.


    Individual beneficiary schemes have been the focus with around 60% of total works taken up in FY 2017-18 belonging to this category. Moreover, there has been emphasis on Natural Resource Management works. Nearly 40 to 50 lakh hectares of land covered through Natural Resources Management for water conservation each year, rejuvenation of rivers, construction of nearly 5 lakh farm ponds every year over the last two years, thrust on roadside plantation and social forestry, provision of goat-shed, poultry-shed and dairy shed as individual beneficiary schemes have led to the creation of livelihood security through durable assets leading to improved incomes. MGNREGS provides 90/95 days work (approx Rs.18,000) for the one crore Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Gramin) (PMAY (G) beneficiaries. It also provides Rs.12,000 perIndividual Household Latrine (IHHL) wherever required and not provided for under Swach Bharat Mission Grameen (SBM-G). Realizing the importance of Anganwadi Centres as pro-poor initiative where poor women can leave young children in a secure environment, MGNREGS funds have been used for large scale construction of Anganwadi Centre buildings. Nearly 20,000 buildings have been completed in FY 2016-17 and FY 2017-18. Likewise, MGNREGS provided support for Solid and Liquid Waste Management and vermi-composting on a large scale. Many state specific projects have emerged leading to generation of wealth from waste. 2.33 lakh Vermi/NADEP composting pits were completed in FY 2017-18.


    The approval of works for FY 2018-19 have already been completed through a process of decentralised planning and appraisal of proposals. The thrust on 2,264 Mission Water Conservation Blocks which are water stressed regions will continue. Likewise, support for IHHLs and 90-95 days of work to PMAY (G) beneficiaries will remain a priority. In FY 2018-19, Gram Sabhas have come up with proposals for nearly five thousand Gramin Haats and their construction to enable producers specially Women Self Help Groups (SHGs) to sell their produce directly to wholesalers. These will be taken up on priority. River rejuvenation and support for irrigation is also a major area of activity which will be undertaken on large scale in FY 2018-19. FY 2018-19 will also see large scale convergence of women SHGs and their livelihood diversification with MGNREGS resources. All arrears to States are being released before 10 th April, 2018 after due verification of financial documents to be submitted by the States/UTs. With a provision of Rs.55,000 crore at BE stage in FY 2018-19 funds for carrying out works at speed will be ensured in the first quarter of April to June, 2018 when the demand for work is normally very high. There shall be no shortage of funds as long as financial discipline, guidelines, transparency norms are fully followed. Over 6,500 Barefoot Technicians have been trained, nearly 4100 Resource Persons have been capacitated in handling of Social Audits and more than 55,000 SHG women have been trained to become social auditors. 26 States have set up their independent Social Audit Units.Social Audit has been provided full support and will continue to be a priority in FY 2018-19. Improvements like mandatory Citizen Information Boards, adoption of simpler seven register system and improved record keeping with photographs, etc., physical display of progress at Gram Panchayat level and forms of public accountability and community participation will be fully emphasized in FY 2018-19.
