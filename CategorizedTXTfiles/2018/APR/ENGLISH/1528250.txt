    243 rd Corps Day of Army Ordnance Corps (AOC) was celebrated on 08 Apr 2018. In a solemn ceremony organised at the ‘Amar Jawan Jyoti’, Lt Gen Giri Raj Singh, Director General of Ordnance Services & Senior Colonel Commandant, laid a wreath on behalf of all ranks and civilian employees of the AOC, to pay homage to the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country. On this day all ranks and civilian employees of the AOC rededicated themselves to work selflessly towards the service of the Nation.


    The AOC has a glorious legacy and has evolved through the times to provide seamless logistics support to the Army. The Corps is now going through a transformative period of modernisation with path breaking use of information technology to usher in an era of absolute visibility of inventory for optimum management of the twin sinews of war i.e. ammunition and materials.
