    Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) and Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) were launched in May, 2015 with a view to enhance the level of insurance penetration in the country and to provide insurance cover to common people especially poor and the under-privileged sections of the society. The State Governments were requested to give wide publicity to the above two schemes and to take pro-active steps to follow up on the information and identify potential claimants and facilitate them to submit their claims. The details of enrolments and claims under these schemes are as follows:
