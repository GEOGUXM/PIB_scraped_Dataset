    The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has asked the State Governments to take all necessary precautionary measures to prevent any untoward incident in view of the forthcoming Ambedkar Jayanti on April 14.


    The MHA has asked that patrolling should be intensified in all sensitive locations to ensure that no loss of life and property takes place and prohibitory orders may be issued wherever necessary. The advisory stressed that District Magistrates and Superintendents of Police may be asked to take all necessary steps for ensuring that law and order situation remains firmly under control in the areas of their jurisdiction. The MHA has advised them to activate community policing initiatives to ensure peace and harmony.


    The communication was issued in the wake of reports of vandalism of statues in some parts of the country and violence during Bharat Bandh on April 2 and April 10.
