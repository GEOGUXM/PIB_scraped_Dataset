      Modernisation Programme for Anganwadi Centres
      Posted On: 06 APR 2018 1:58PM by PIB Delhi


    Under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme (renamed as Anganwadi Services under Umbrella ICDS Scheme), construction of Anganwadi Centre buildings has been taken up in all the States/UTs. Joint guidelines for construction of 4 lakh Anganwadi Centre (AWC) buildings across the country in convergence with Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) were issued on 17.02.2016.


    Under the revised guidelines, provision for construction of 1 lakh new AWC buildings has been made. Central share for construction of AWC building is Rs. 1 lakh per AWC building for all States/UTs, which is reimbursable on completion of construction work.


    The Ministry is partnering with private sector to successfully modernise Anganwadi Centres across the country. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed between Ministry of Women and Child Development and M/s Vedanta on 21st September, 2015 (effective for three years) as a part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) for construction of the 4000 Anganwadi Centre buildings through its own resources primarily in the States of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.


    The modernised Anganwadi Centres also follow the ICDS programme to combat nutritional deficiency by providing all the six services available under the Scheme. The healthy atmosphere and safe place for the children visiting the AWCs definitely contribute to the reduction in the level of malnutrition.


    This information was given by Union Minister for Women and Child Development, Smt.Maneka Sanjay Gandhi in reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
