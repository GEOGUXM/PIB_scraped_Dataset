      Posted On: 13 MAY 2018 2:58PM by PIB Delhi


    General Bipin Rawat, Chief of the Army Staff shall be visiting Sri Lanka from 14 to 17 May 2018 on an official visit. It shall be the first visit of General Bipin Rawat to Sri Lanka. During the visit, he is scheduled to meet the senior most political and military hierarchy of Sri Lanka.


    The visit assumes significance in light of Indiaâ€™s persistent efforts to strengthen the existing bonds of friendship and military cooperation based on mutual interests and understanding. Indian Army has been catering not only for varied training requirements of the Sri Lankan Army including imparting specific tailor-made training in different fields but also providing military hardware support. During the visit, the Chief of the Army Staff shall be inaugurating a communication Laboratory at School of Signals, Kandy, conceptualized and established by the Indian Army, to train the personnel of Sri Lanka Army Signal Corps. The Army Chief shall also be visiting the Sri Lanka Military Academy at Diyatalawa to exchange best practices related to pre-commissioning training being followed by the two armies.


    Apart from interaction with the senior leadership of the three Services, General Bipin Rawat shall also be meeting the Regional Military Commanders at Kandy and Trincomalee. The visit is yet another milestone in reaching out to our immediate neighborhood and take forward the military to military cooperation to the next level.
