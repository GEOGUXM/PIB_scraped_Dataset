    Shri Paswan informed that as per the schematic guidelines, the hostels with atleast 2/3 rd of the resident students belonging to SC/ST/OBC community are eligible to get subsidized foodgrain for all the resident students, including those who belong to other categories. The Central Issue Price of foodgrain under the scheme is fixed at BPL rates.


    The Food Minister further stated that the scale of issue of wheat and rice (ratio to be decided on the basis of food habits in different areas) is as per the nutrition requirement of the residents, subject to a maximum of 15 kg per resident per month.
