    The Film Facilitation Office is in the process of establishing a dedicated web portal that will disseminate information on filming locations and the facilities available in India for production/post production. Accordingly, the portal will help potential production companies looking to shoot in India to obtain permissions, explore potential benefits (tangible and non-tangible) and obtain an overview of various locations in India that could benefit the storyline of the film under consideration.


    Application - The portal will facilitate the acceptance of application for shooting feature films / TV & Web Reality shows and series and / or TV & Web shows and series in India, along with online payments and issuing permissions. Foreign Audio Visual Agencies intending to shoot documentary films / AV commercials in India would link to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Web portal.

It would capture detailed information pertaining to a particular location, resources or facilities available in a standardized format that would include basic location description, map, best time to shoot, connectivity, photographs, digital walk tour, permissions required, previous movies shot etc.


    Enlisting of Information - The portal would provide information on all Co-production treaties, shooting guidelines of various Central and State agencies, permission process, link to all trade associations.


    Resources and Facilities Directory - The portal would have a holistic database of the resources available in the Indian film industry including DOP, cast, crew, casting agents, line producers, service / facility providers as well as producers. This would not only help build reliability for the Indian producers who shoot abroad but also enhance their profile internationally, thus leading to greater international tie-ups and engagements. It will also link all trade associations like Producers Guild, FFI, CII, FICCI, etc.
