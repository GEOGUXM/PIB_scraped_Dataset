    A misleading news item has appeared today (31.05.2018) in Indian Express alleging kickbacks to Indian Govt. officials through Global Marketing SP Ltd. in the contract for spares for AN-32 Aircraft.


    It is informed that MoD or IAF has neither interacted nor signed any agreement with Global Marketing SP Ltd., nor were any such agreements witnessed. IAF has also confirmed that Global Marketing SP Ltd. has not participated in any of the meetings held towards finalization of the contract dated 26.11.2014 with STE Ukraine.


    Embassy of Ukraine in India had sent a request to MHA and MEA, Govt. of India dated 06.03.2018 for legal assistance in investigation of a criminal case filed against officials of Ukraine Governmentâ€™s State Owned Enterprise (STE). This is as per international treaty between India and Ukraine. This request contains a list of questions to be answered. There are no allegations against any Indian Govt. official. Government of India has only been requested to render legal assistance.
