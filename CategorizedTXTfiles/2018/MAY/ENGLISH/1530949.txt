      Posted On: 02 MAY 2018 3:26PM by PIB Delhi


    The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi today has approved the proposal for renaming and restructuring of Multi-sectoral Development Programme (MsDP) as Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK). CCEA has also approved its continuation during the remaining period of the 14 th Finance Commission.


    Impact:

      * The restructured programme would provide better socio economic infrastructure facilities to the minority communities particularly in the field of education, health & skill development as compared to the present situation, which would further lead to lessening of the gap between the national average and the minority communities with regard to backwardness parameters. The flexibility introduced in the programme will enable addressing important issues that would result in speedier implementation leading to greater inclusiveness of the minority communities.
      * The criteria for identification of Minority Concentration Towns and Clusters of Villages have been rationalized by lowering the population percentage criteria of Minority Communities and fulfilment of backwardness parameters in the following manners:-
      * Earlier only those Towns which were found backward in terms of both in Basic Amenities and Socio-economic parameters were taken up as MCTs. Now, the Towns which were found backward in either or both of the criteria have been taken up as MCT.
      * Earlier only those Cluster of Villages which were having at-least 50% population of Minority Community were taken. Now the population criteria has been lowered to 25%.

    · These rationalization of criteria would facilitate the inclusive growth of communities and social harmony,

      * The area to be covered under PMJVK would be 57% more as compared to the existing MsDP.
      * The MsDP covered 196 district of the country whereas PMJVK will cover 308 districts of the country.

    Expenditure:


    Funding of the scheme would be from budgetary provision of the Ministry. The Expenditure Finance Committee, Department of Expenditure has recommended for the continuation of the programme as PMJVK at the cost of Rs. 3,972 crore as per layout below:

    (*The Budgetary allocation of Rs.1200 crores was received in 2017-18. The programme was implemented on the same format as approved by Cabinet for implementation during 12 th Plan period)


    As stipulated in the scheme, the recurring/maintenance expenses will be borne by the State Government/UTs/Organization .


    Beneficiaries:


    The Programme aims to address development deficits in the identified minority concentration areas. The identification of minority concentration areas has been done on the basis of presence of substantial population of notified Minority Communities based on Census, 2011. The inclusion of Minority Concentration District Headquarters along with the Minority Concentration Towns having population more than 25,000, Minority Concentration Blocks and Cluster of Villages as per Census, 2011 data, will extend the coverage of population of minority communities.


    States/Districts covered:

      * The PMJVK will be implemented in Minority Concentration District Hqrs(MCD Hrs), Minority Concentration Block(MCBs), Minority Concentration Towns(MCTs) falling in 308 districts of 32 States/UTs.
      * The unit area for implementation will include 109 MCD Hqrs, 870 MCBs and 321 MCTs.
      * Moreover, the scheme will also be implemented in Backward Clusters of Minority Concentration Villages(CoMCV). These CoMCV will be identified on the proposal of the States/UTs as per criteria of PMJVK.
      * The PMJVK would now cover five more States/UTs namely Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Nagaland, Goa and Pondicherry.
      * Minority Concentration Areas of 61 districts out of 115 Aspirational districts have been covered under PMJVK.

    Areas identified by data of Census 2011


      * Unit area of implementation has been further broadened by including Minority Concentration Districts Headquarters in addition to the minority concentration Blocks, Minority Concentration Towns and cluster of minority concentration villages.

      * As compared to MSDP, the PMJVK would now cover five more States/UTs namely Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Nagaland, goa and Pondicherry. All States/UTs earlier covered under MsDP have also been included under PMJVK.
      * Under PMJVK Minority Concentration Blocks (MCBs) and Minority Concentration Towns (MCTs) falling in 308district of 32 States have been covered.
      * The area covered under PMJVK will have 109 MCD Hqrs., 870 MCBs and 321 MCTs .

    Special focus by earmarking funds:


    (i) 80% of the resources under the PMJVK would be earmarked for projects related to education , health and skill development.


    (ii) 33 to 40% of resources under the PMJVK would be specifically allocated for women centric projects.


    Monitoring of the Programme strengthened:


    (i) Provisions related to Monitoring Mechanism, Transparency and Publicity of Information have been further strengthened by including an online module along with geo-tagging.


    (ii) A provision to bring all implementing agencies under Public Finance Management System(PFMS) and its effective use ensured to monitor fund utilization has been made in PMJVK.


    Background:


    > MsDP has been identified as one of the Core of the Core Schemes under National Development Agenda in the Report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalization of Centrally Sponsored Schemes, which was constituted by NITI Aayog. The programme was launched in the year 2008-09 in 90 identified Minority Concentration Districts (MCDs) having at least 25% minority population and below national average with respect to one or both of the backwardness parameters with the objective of developing assets for socio-economic and basic amenities. The MCDs were identified on the basis of census 2001 data. The programme continued during 11th Five Year Plan.


    > The MsDP was restructured in June 2013 for implementation during 12th Five Year Plan and the area of implementation was replaced by Minority Concentration Blocks (MCB), Minority Concentration Towns (MCT) and Clusters of Villages. Total MCBs - 710, MCTs - 66 in 196 Districts. The MsDP is currently in operation in 27 States/UTs.


    > MsDP has been designed primarily to address the developmental gaps/deficits in identified backward minority concentration areas by topping up of existing Centrally Sponsored Schemes of various Central ministries/departments without any change in the norms, guidelines and the funding pattern.


    > The projects considered are additional class rooms, laboratories, school buildings, hostels, toilets, buildings for Polytechnics, ITIs, Community Health Centres, Primary Health Centres / Sub-centres, Anganwadi Centres, Rural Housing etc.


    > In addition to gap filling projects, MsDP also provides for taking up innovative projects which are not covered by any of the existing CSS of various ministries and these are funded in the ratio of 60:40 and for NE and Hilly States at 90:10 between the Centre and States. This includes Sadbhav Mandap, Market shed etc.


    Details and progress of scheme if already running


      * Since inception of the Programme, projects for construction of 16 Degree Colleges, 2019 School Building, 37,267 Additional Classrooms, 1141 Hostels, 170 Industrial Training Institutes(ITIs), 48 Polytechnics, 38,736 Anganwadi Centres, 3,48,624 lAY(PMAY) houses, 340 Sadbhavna Mandaps, 67 Residential Schools, 436 Market sheds, 4436 Health Projects etc. were sanctioned.


      * MsDP has made substantial progress in achieving its target for the identified areas and has created useful infrastructures/assets for the people in the areas with substantial minority population. However, the development deficit identified in the selected areas has not been fully addressed.
