The index for ‘Manufacture of Textiles’ group rose by 0.3 percent to 114.4 (provisional) from 114.1 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of viscose yarn, weaving & finishing of textiles, cotton yarn and synthetic yarn (1% each). However, the price of manufacture of cordage, rope, twine & netting, woollen yarn and manufacture of made-up textile articles, except apparel (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Wood and of Products of Wood and Cork’ group declined by 0.1 percent to 131.6 (provisional) from 131.7 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of plywood block boards and wooden box/crate (1% each). However, the price of particle boards, wood cutting, processed/sized and wooden block-compressed or not (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Paper and Paper Products’ group declined by 0.1 percent to 120.8 (provisional) from 120.9 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of paper bag including craft paper bag (3%), kraft paper and paper carton/box (2% each) and base paper, duplex paper and laminated plastic sheet (1% each). However, the price of newsprint (4%) and corrugated paper board and card board (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of other Non-Metallic Mineral Products’ group rose by 1.2 percent to 115.2 (provisional) from 113.8 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of graphite rod (20%), porcelain sanitary ware (3%), non ceramic tiles (2%) and asbestos corrugated sheet, clinker, slag cement, ceramic tiles (vitrified tiles), plain bricks and glass bottle (1% each). However, the price of ordinary sheet glass (4%), marble slab (3%) and pozzolana cement, lime & calcium carbonate, toughened glass and poles & posts of concrete (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Computer, Electronic and Optical Products’ group rose by 1.1 percent to 111.6 (provisional) from 110.4 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of scientific time keeping device (6%), meter (non-electrical) (5%), telephone sets including mobile hand sets (3%) and clock, capacitors, electronic printed circuit board (pcb)/micro circuit and colour TV (1% each). However, the price of electro-diagnostic apparatus, used in medical, surgical, dental or veterinary sciences, microscope and sunglasses (3% each) and computer peripherals (1%) declined.
