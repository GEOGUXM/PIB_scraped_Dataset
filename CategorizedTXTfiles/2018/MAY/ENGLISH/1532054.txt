    Addressing the Officer Trainees, the Prime Minister stressed the importance of representing India abroad in the context of Indiaâ€™s rich history, culture and traditions. The Prime Minister said that IFS Officers should remain alive not only to the current national priorities, but also future requirements for national development. The Prime Minister encouraged the Officer Trainees to become more tech-savvy and engage fully with the State governments and diaspora, who are increasingly important stakeholders in the conduct of foreign relations.
