      Clarification of Ministry of HRD regarding action taken on the issue of bogus teachers
      Posted On: 12 MAY 2018 6:54PM by PIB Delhi


    This is in response to some reports appearing in the online press that no action has been taken on the 80,000 bogus teachers who have been identified after introducing Aadhaar number verification on the Gurujan portal of AISHE.


    The HRD Ministry has clarified that the fact mentioned in the report that no action has been taken is incorrect and it is not reflecting the actual position in the matter. All the 80,000 names have been shared with both AICTE and UGC â€“ the regulators, for taking up with the respective institutions and verify the reasons for incorrect entries. Both the regulators are still on the job since the number of cases is very high. It is also to be clarified that in this case an opportunity is being given to the institutions to rectify mistakes if any in showing entries in Aadhaar numbers. This facility has been opened in the AISHE portal for making the corrections.
