    The Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat programme was launched by the Prime Minister on 31 st October, 2016 to promote engagement amongst the people of different states/UTs so as to enhance mutual understanding and bonding between people of diverse cultures, thereby securing stronger unity and integrity of India. The Uttarakhand edition of Rashtriya Sanskriti Mahotsav would be the 9 th edition in the series.
