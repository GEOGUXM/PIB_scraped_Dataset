      Posted On: 24 MAY 2018 1:48PM by PIB Delhi


    The Central Vigilance Commissioner (CVC) Shri K.V. Chowdary has called for preventive vigilance to check occurrence of corrupt practices. Speaking at the inauguration of a workshop on “Preventive Vigilance- Dissemination of Good Practices” here today, he said, this can be achieved by identifying and plugging vulnerable areas through systemic improvements and structural remedies. He said these measures fulfil the objective of preempting corrupt practices and further enhance the organisational efficiency.


    Shri Chowdary said while probable vulnerable areas are unique to organisations, few commonly occurring corrupt practices are in areas like procurement, sale of goods and services, human resource management, delivery of services to public and enforcement. He called for improving existing systems, reviewing processes for simplification, leveraging technology, reducing personal discretion, effective control and supervision, educating citizens and training for bringing about transparency and accountability in organisations.


    The one-day workshop has five sessions where government organisations and Public Sector Undertakings including Financial Institutions gave presentations and shared good practices adopted by them. Some of the themes for discussion included IT-based recruitment system, use of geospatial technology for infrastructure and planning, vehicle monitoring system, leveraging technology for preventive vigilance, digitisation of land records and systemic improvements in concept of concurrent audit.
