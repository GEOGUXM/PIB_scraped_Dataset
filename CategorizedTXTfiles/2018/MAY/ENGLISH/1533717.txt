      Posted On: 29 MAY 2018 12:02PM by PIB Delhi


    Southwest monsoon has set in over Kerala, today, the 29 th May 2018

          + Today, the southwest monsoon has further advanced into remaining parts of southeast Arabian Sea, Comorin â€“ Maldives area, entire Lakshadweep, most parts of Kerala, some parts of Tamil Nadu and some more parts of southwest, central and northeast Bay of Bengal.
          + Thus the southwest monsoon has set in over Kerala, today, the 29 th May 2018, 3 days ahead of its normal date.
          + The Northern Limit of Monsoon (NLM) passes through Lat. 12 0 N/ Long 60 0 E, Lat 12 0 N/ Long 65 0 E, Lat.12 0 N/ Long 70 0 E, Kannur, Coimbatore, Kodaikanal, Tuticorin, Lat. 09 0 N/ Long 80 0 E, Lat. 13 0 N/ Long 85 0 E, Lat.18 0 N/ Long 90 0 E, Lat. 21 0 N/ Long 93 0 E. Figure-1 shows the Northern Limit of Monsoon (NLM) as on today.

    Prevailing meteorological conditions leading to onset of monsoon over Kerala.


      * Widespread rainfall occurred over Kerala, during the past 3-4 days. The 14 rainfall monitoring stations for Monsoon onset over Kerala have reported more than 60% rainfall from 25 th May. (Fig-2).

      * Westerly winds have strengthened in the lower levels (more than 30 knots) and deepened with Westerly/ West-southwesterly winds upto 600 hPa (approximately upto 4.5km) over the south Arabian Sea (equator to Lat. 10 o N and Long. 55 o E to 80 o E) from today morning.
      * There is persistent convection (cloudiness indicated by Outgoing Long-wave Radiation values <200 Wm-1) from 23 rd May. The Satellite (INSAT-3D) derived Outgoing Long wave Radiation value in the box confined by Lat. 5-10 o N, Long. 70-80 o E is 187 W/m 2 . (Fig-2).
      * In addition to the above features, the following developments are also noticed:
      * An east-west shear zone runs roughly along latitude 12 0 N (across south peninsula) at 3.1 km above mean sea level.
      * A well marked low pressure area lies over southeast and adjoining eastcentral Arabian Sea off north Kerala- Karnataka coasts.
      * Another well marked low pressure area lies over eastcentral and adjoining northeast Bay of Bengal. It is likely to concentrate into a Depression during next 12 hours.

    Further advance during next 48 hours


    Conditions are favorable for further advance of Southwest Monsoon into some parts of central Arabian Sea, remaining parts of Kerala, some parts of coastal and south interior Karnataka, some more parts of eastcentral and northeast Bay of Bengal, and some parts of northeastern states during next 48 hours.
