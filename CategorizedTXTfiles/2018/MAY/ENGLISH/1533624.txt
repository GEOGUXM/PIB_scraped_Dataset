      Posted On: 28 MAY 2018 1:04PM by PIB Delhi


    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted with Ujjwala beneficiaries across the country, through video conference.


    Three Ujjwala beneficiaries were present at each of over 600 centres across the length and breadth of the country, for this interaction.


    An estimated 10 lakh people viewed the interaction through various platforms, which included the Narendra Modi App and various television news channels and social media platforms, among others.


    Expressing happiness at being able to interact with the beneficiaries, and share their experiences, through technology, the Prime Minister said that the Ujjwala scheme has become a symbol of progress. He added that it is driving remarkable social transformation, which is in turn, influencing the holistic development of the country.


    Approximately 4 crore women in rural areas have received LPG connections so far, through the UjjwalaYojana. In all, nearly 10 crore new LPG connections have been issued in the four years since 2014, as compared to 13 crore in the nearly six decade period from 1955 to 2014.


    In his initial remarks, the Prime Minister quoted a story written by Munshi Premchand in 1933, to highlight the importance of easing the lives of home-makers. He said Ujjwala has brought about benefits through better health outcomes, freedom from poisonous smoke andcleaner fuel. He said women now have a greater opportunity to earn extra income, as time spent on cooking has been reduced.


    The Prime Minister emphasized that the Union Government has been paying attention to ensure that there are no middlemen involved in this scheme, and the beneficiaries are chosen through a transparent process.


    He said that 69 percent villages in India now have 100 percent LPG penetration, while 81 percent villages have more than 75 percent LPG penetration.


    Interacting with the Prime Minister, beneficiaries explained how the LPG connection had reduced time spent on cooking, and enhanced the quality of life for the entire family.
