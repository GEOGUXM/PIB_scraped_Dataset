      Posted On: 15 MAY 2018 6:41PM by PIB Delhi


    The Integrated Nodal Agency (INA), in its meeting held today under the chairpersonship of WCD Secretary, decided to issue one more Look-out-Circular(LoC).


    The INA also recommended that the passport of the concerned person may be impounded/revoked as per provisions of the Passport Act.


    Last month, the Ministry had issued 5 LoCs after examining the complaints received regarding NRI matrimonial disputes.


    In criminal matter involving NRIâ€™s, LoC could be issued by the INA in cognizable offences, when the overseas husband is deliberately evading arrest or not appearing in the trial court despite Non Bailable Warrants and other coercive measures or there is a likelihood that he will leave the country to evade trial or arrest. The LoC will be issued after having the case scrutinised by NCW.
