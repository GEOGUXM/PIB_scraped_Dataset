    Shri R K Singh, Minister of State (IC) for Power and New & Renewable Energy, Government of India, laid the foundation stone of the Underground Cabling Project in the Kumbh area of Haridwar today. The project is very significant as Haridwar is one of the most important pilgrimage sites in India and a large number of devotees visit this holy city round the year.


    Speaking after the foundation laying ceremony, Shri RK Singh said that millions of devotees come to Haridwar during Kumbh. This project will ensure the safety of pilgrims and enhance the aesthetics of the divine city. The project will benefit the citizens of Uttrakhand by way of reduced electricity losses. Roads will also become wider once overhead electric poles are removed.


    This project will be implemented in Haridwar under the Government’s flagship scheme ‘Integrated Power Development Scheme’ (IPDS). Underground cables have several advantages e.g. – reduced losses, low chances of developing faults and low maintenance costs. Whereas overhead lines are vulnerable to lightning strikes which may lead to interruption.


    Several dignitaries from Power Ministry and Uttarakhand Government graced at the occasion.
