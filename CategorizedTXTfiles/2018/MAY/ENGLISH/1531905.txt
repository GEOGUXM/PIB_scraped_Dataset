    Pointing out some new initiatives under Ministry of DoNER funded works, Dr. Jitendra Singh said that amenities have been created at Nathu La in Sikkim for acclimatisation of pilgrims undertaking Mansarover Yatra through this route. He added that such tourist facilities are being developed at the popular tourist hub Majuli island in Assam. He said, improved connectivity has already seen growth in tourism in the NE region, which has immense potential to generate employment.


    The Tourism Minister Shri Alphons said, development of tourism and identifying new tourist hubs in the NE region is a priority for his ministry and added that funds will be made available for this task. He said that North East region has great locations which could be ideal as film shooting destinations. He further said that the region could be great attraction for tourists from South East Asian countries. The Ministry of Tourism will provide support for boosting tourism avenues in the North East region, he added.
