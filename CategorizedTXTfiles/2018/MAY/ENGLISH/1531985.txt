    Union Minister for Road Transport, Highways, Shipping, Water Resources and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari will inaugurate the upgraded 4-lane NH-15 from Amritsar to Bhatinda and NH-64 from Zirakpur to Bhatinda, and will lay the foundation stone of 2-laning with paved shoulders of the Munak-Jhakhal-Budhlana section of NH-144B in Punjab tomorrow.


    The 175 kilometre NH-15 stretch has been completed in 24 months at a cost of Rs 2893 crore. It will benefit the commuters as it will now take only two hours to travel between Amritsar and Bhatinda. The Harike bypass on the NH will also reduce the traffic and resultant pollution in the Harike city. Three ROBs, five flyovers, 12 underpasses and 31 large junctions have been constructed under the project.


    Similarly, the 216 kilometre NH-64 stretch has been completed in 24 months at a cost of Rs 2264 crore. The NH will benefit the tourists travelling to Bhatinda, Amritsar and Simla, as the time taken for travelling between Chandigarh and Bhatinda will reduce to three hours only. District Headquarters like, Mohali, Patiala, Sangrur, Bhatinda, Faridkot and Amritsar will get connected by a 4-lane highway. The project includes an ROB, 12 flyovers, 22 underpasses and 42 large junctions.


    The 45.89 kilometre 2-laning with paved shoulders of the Munak-Jhakhal-Budhlana section of NH-144B will be completed in 18 months at a cost of Rs 293 crore. It will reduce the travel time between Bhikhi and Tohana by an hour, and will smoothen the travelling between Haryana and Punjab. The project involves construction of a flyover in front of Guru Nanak College and a grade separator near football chowk of Buldhana. It will have five kilometres of service roads, two VUPs and six small bridges.
