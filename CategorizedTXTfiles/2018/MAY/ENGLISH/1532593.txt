    This is with reference to the article “ Only 22% funds utilised in six Housing Ministry schemes ” published on 12 th May 2018 in a newspaper which was based on the information given to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Urban development. This is a misinterpretation of the statistics relating to funds released/utilisation regarding schemes/missions being implemented by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, resulting in incorrect inferences. While funds released/utilisation is part of the normal government financial procedures to ensure proper accounting systems, it is not a true barometer of the physical progress and speed of the implementation of the mission targets/objectives. Most of the schemes have large capital intensive projects with a completion time range of 1-3 years for the project.


    The Ministry of Housing and Urban affairs has been able to achieve substantial milestones in both physical and financial terms in so far as mission objectives/targets are concerned. T he utilization certificates are required to be submitted within 12 months of the closure of the financial year in which the grants were released. Thus,during the year 2017-18, while the total cumulative grants released was Rs.46,663 crores, Utilization Certificates were due only for the grants released upto March 2016, i.e. for approximately Rs.10,365 crores . The utilization figures, given to the Standing Committee pertained mostly to funds released upto 2015-16 as only this was due in 2017-18. In fact, at the closure of the year 2017-18, as against the due amount of Rs.10,365 crores for utilisation certificates (UCs), actual UCs for an amount of Rs.15,403 crores were received in the Ministry.This figure also included some UCs which were due in the next financial year i.e. 2018-19.


    Mission wise progress of funds released, projects progress and utilisation status, etc. is given below:
