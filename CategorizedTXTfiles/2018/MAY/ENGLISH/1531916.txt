      ICF Gives a Fresh Look to LHB Air-Conditioned Coaches
      Posted On: 11 MAY 2018 6:21PM by PIB Delhi


    As part of its plans to innovate coach designs, now, ICF (Integral Coach Factory, a production unit under Ministry of Railways) has turned out one LACCN (LHB 3 Tier AC) Coach with continuous windows, by providing additional glasses on vertical pillars. This will provide the Air-conditioned coach an aesthetically pleasing and very good appearance from outside. It has been planned to provide such continuous windows in all AC coaches in a phased manner.


    The LHB Coaches made by ICF at present have been provided with split windows of size 1100 mm (L) x 680 mm (H).


    However, there will be no change in the interior of the coaches that will be maintained as before.
