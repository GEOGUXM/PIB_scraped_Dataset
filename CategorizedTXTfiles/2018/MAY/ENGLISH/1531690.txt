      Posted On: 09 MAY 2018 2:41PM by PIB Delhi


    Forty-one officer trainees of Class-I Accounts and Finance Service attending 25 th Professional Training Course at the National Institute of Financial Management, Faridabad, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, today (May 9, 2018) at Rashtrapati Bhavan.


    Addressing the officers trainees, the President said their work and responsibilities sit at the defining edge of “good governance” in the country. Therefore, they have to maintain the highest standard of ethics, accountability and transparency at all times in their respective fields. They have equally critical role to play in implementation of government schemes and projects.


    The President said that the mantra of our Government is “Minimum Government, Maximum Governance”. At the same time, there is rising expectation among our citizens for greater efficiency in public service delivery today. The task at hand for civil servants is demanding. But with greater integration of technology in their work, be it new IT platforms, payment gateways or the endless possibilities of cyberspace, they can achieve the desired results. Reforming our accounting, budget and audit systems and constantly updating them in line with global best practices must also be high on their agenda.
