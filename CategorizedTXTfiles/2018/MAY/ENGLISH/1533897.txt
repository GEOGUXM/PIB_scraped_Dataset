    The Government is for the first time issuing guidelines for Adventure Tourism in India. These guidelines will be launched by the Minister of State for Tourism (Independent Charge), Shri. K. J. Alphons, at an event in New Delhi on 31 st May 2018. The guidelines on Safety and Quality Norms for Adventure Tourism in India have been formulated along with the Adventure Tour Operators Association of India (ATOAI).


    In an effort to make adventure sports safer, the set of guidelines list out the basic minimum standards required for adventure tourism activities in India. Adventure tourism has grown rapidly over the past few years playing a vital role in the economic growth of India as well as attracting a large number of travellers from across the globe to the country. The sole aim of this initiative is to help adventure tour operators understand and execute safety guidelines in a better manner. These guidelines cover land, air and water based activities which include mountaineering, trekking, bungee jumping, paragliding, kayaking, scuba diving, snorkeling, river rafting and many other sports.


    The Ministry of Tourism along with ATOAI and all the tourism stakeholders are committed for India to be looked at as one of the best adventure tourism destinations, with a strong safety management system in place.
