    This is in reference to some news reports on increase in LPG prices in the recent months which is not based on facts. In this connection, it is clarified that t he retail selling price of LPG (non-subsidized price) at Delhi has come down from Rs.747/- in the month of December, 2017 to Rs.650.50/- in the month of May, 2018, a fall of Rs.96.50/-.
