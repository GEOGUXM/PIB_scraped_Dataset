    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall have been given in following sub-sections:


         1. Crude oil production by ONGC during April, 2018 was 1777.33 TMT which is 1.36% higher than the monthly target but 3.78% lower when compared with April, 2017.

         2. Crude oil production by OIL during April, 2018 was 274.33 TMT which is 1.65% lower than monthly target but 0.24% higher than production in April, 2017. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:
         1. Less than planned contribution from old wells – Rise in water cut in wells and decline in total liquid production of wells of Greater Hapjan and Greater Chandmari Fields.
     3. Less than planned contribution from work over wells.

         1. Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April, 2018 was 863.33 TMT which is 2.64% higher than the monthly target and 5.48% higher than April, 2017. Shortfall in production was mainly due to closure of 2 wells in D1D3 and 1 well in MA field KG-DWN-98/3 and well B6 ceased to flow on 30/4/2018 due to low reservoir pressure.


    Natural Gas

     1. Natural gas production during April, 2018 was 2662.97 MMSCM which is 0.95% higher than the target for the month and 5.10% higher when compared with April, 2017. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II. Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of April, 2018 vis-à-vis April, 2017 has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

    Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production


         1. Natural gas production by ONGC during April, 2018 was 1972.04 MMSCM which is 4.93% higher than the monthly target and 10.11% higher when compared with April, 2017.


         1. Natural gas production by OIL during April, 2018 was 221.42 MMSCM which is 6.81% lower than the monthly target and 8.23% lower than April, 2017. The shortfall in gas production is primarily due to temporary suspension of supply to NEEPCO for about 8 days due to pigging and cleaning of their delivery line by the transporter M/s. AGCL. Upliftment of gas by M/s. BVFCL also suffered due to unscheduled maintenance work at their Namrup-II & III plants.


         1. Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April, 2018 was 469.51 MMSCM which is 9.85% lower than the monthly target and 6.36% lower when compared with April, 2017. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


     1. Sohagpur West CBM Block: Underperformance of CBM wells. (RIL)

     2. AAP-ON-94/1: Production lowered due to less consumer demand. (HOEC)
     3. Raniganj East CBM block: Some wells closed for planned maintenance and refrac jobs. Major customer 'Matix' under operational shutdown. (ESSAR)
     4. KG-DWN-98/3: Closure of 2 wells in D1D3 and 1 well in MA field. In D1D3 field, well A13 on 15 Dec 2017, A5 on 24 Jan 2018 B6 on 30 April 2018 ceased and well A20 stopped flowing from 18 Feb to 10 March 2018 due to low reservoir pressure. (RIL)

    Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)


     1. Refinery production during April, 2018 was 19852.83 TMT which is 3.43% lower than the target for the month and 0.87% lower when compared with April, 2017. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III. Company-wise production for the month of April, 2018 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

    Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production


    3.1 CPSE Refineries’ production during April, 2018 was 11635.25 TMT which is 0.59% lower than the target for the month but 4.20% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:

             1. IOCL, Paradip: Lower due delay in stabilization post M&I shutdown.
             2. HPCL, Visakh: Lower due to unplanned CDU shutdown..
             3. CPCL, Manali: Lower due to FCCU / DCU shutdown.

    3.2 Production in JV refineries during April, 2018 were 1500.66 TMT which is 8.19% higher than the target for the month and 9.34% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Shortfall in production in BORL was mainly due to outage of refinery hydrocracker unit.


    3.3 Production in private refineries during April, 2018 was 6716.93 TMT which is lower than the target for the month and when compared with April, 2017 by 10.05% and 10.29 % respectively.


    3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of April, 2018 vis-à-vis April, 2017 are given at Annexures-IV and V respectively.
