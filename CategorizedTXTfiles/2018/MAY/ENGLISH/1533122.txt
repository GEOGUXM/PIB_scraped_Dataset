    The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the "Universal Service Obligation Fund [USOF]‚Äù supported scheme to provide mobile services at 4072 tower locations identified by MHA in inhabited uncovered areas affected by Left Wing Extremism [LWE] of 96 districts in 10 States for Phase-ll project. The total project cost would be Rs.7,330 Crore.


    This network would be used by the security personnel deployed in LWE affected areas. Project will also provide the mobile services to help the residents in unconnected inhabited villages which would improve the economic activities in the region. It will give impetus to the e-Governance activities in the backward and LWE affected area with the availability of digital mobile connectivity.


    The numbers of Tower locations proposed in the 10 States are as follows:
