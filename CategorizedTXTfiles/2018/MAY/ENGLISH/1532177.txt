    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, visited an exhibition on Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) technologies at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) in Trombay, Mumbai today (May 15, 2018). He also inaugurated DAE facilities there.


    Speaking on the occasion, the President said that India is recognised as one of the leading nations in the use of nuclear technologies across multiple disciplines, ranging from energy to agriculture and from medicine to waste management. However, the journey towards excelling in this domain started at BARC almost six decades ago. Since then, the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) has grown to become a multidisciplinary organisation with facilities spread across the nation.


    Acknowledging the achievements made by Indian nuclear scientists in using nuclear technology in the areas of healthcare, food and agriculture, water resources management and environmental protection, the President said these achievements are commendable. Nation building, he said, is a long-term and never-ending process and as such we have lot of challenges to overcome. The DAE has an important responsibility in our national development process.
