      Posted On: 28 MAY 2018 4:58PM by PIB Delhi


    In context of some media reports today interpreting that Election Commission of India contradicts Central Information Commissionâ€™s directive on Political parties covered under the purview of RTI Act, it is clarified that Election Commission of India goes by the CIC order of 3 rd June, 2013 that national parties would be public authorities for the purposes of RTI Act and in pursuance of this all the information about the contributions received by them as well as their annual audited accounts, as and when submitted to the Commission are put in public domain.


    As regards consultation with leaders of different political parties before presenting electoral bonds is concerned, this issue has been transferred to Ministry of Finance as it might concern them and not the Election Commission of India.
