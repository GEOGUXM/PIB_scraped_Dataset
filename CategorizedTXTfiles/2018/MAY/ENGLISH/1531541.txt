Kendriya Vidyalaya          234

Eng College                 75

    10. The news about ,a case where a child from Tamil Nadu claimed that he had been forced to go to Udaipur center by CBSE was wrong, because his online application records show that the child had himself opted for Udaipur as an option for exam center. Similarly, news about depriving Tamil Nadu candidates of attempting question paper in Tamil. was also wrong. In fact, all candidates, who had opted Tamil as medium were given centres within Tamil Nadu, and were given question papers in Tamil.
    In 4 out of 2255 centers in India, during the conduct of examination, when it came to notice that the medium of Question paper was not correct for the candidates, CBSE immediately responded by providing them question paper in the language of their choice.
    11. CBSE has been successful in conducting these high stakes exams largely due to the cooperation of the student and parent community through the years.
    12. The media has also unconditionally supported the Board’s initiatives to curb the menace of adoption of unfair means by candidates.
    13. CBSE shall continue to endeavor to strengthen these exams further every year and bring in as much facilitation for the students as possible for taking these exams, and also for ensuring fairness, transparency, authenticity and sanctity of NEET exams.
