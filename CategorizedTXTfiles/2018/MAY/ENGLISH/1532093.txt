      * Sufficient land should be earmarked in the upcoming airports for cargo operations.
      * Should create air cargo trans-shipment hubs in India – sourcing cargo from neighbouring states and partner countries.
      * The policy should aim at creating inter-modal hubs and should have air-sea, air-road, air-inland waterways connectivity
      * Geographical location and distinct products related to that location should be kept in mind while developing the cargo policy
