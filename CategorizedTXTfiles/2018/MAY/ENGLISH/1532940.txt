    Election Commission of India today held a round table conference with former CECs/ECs. The consultation meeting was attended by former CECs S/Shri M.S.Gill, J.M.Lyngdoh, T.S.Krishna Murthy, B.B.Tandon, Dr. S.Y.Quraishi, V.S. Sampath, H.R. Bramha, Dr. Nasim Zaidi and former EC GVG Krishnamurty.


    Chief Election Commissioner Shri O.P.Rawat, Election Commissioners Shri Sunil Arora and Shri Ashok Lavasa, welcomed all former CECs/ECs present. The invitees lauded the Commission for this initiative and expressed the hope that such consultations would become a regular feature.


    The deliberations focused on following aspects of electoral management:

      * It was noted that universal use of EVM/VVPAT is a commendable initiative. It was opined that Awareness programmes should be extended to educate all the voters about its benefits. This will help in avoiding any controversy about its use.
      * It was noticed that hate speeches are being used during campaigns which vitiate the political atmosphere. There is an urgent need to control such speeches in larger public interest.
      * It was deliberated to analyse the duration of polls so that the number of phases is reduced. The lesser number of phases will reduce the period of MCC it was noted, which has its implications in multiple phases of elections.
      * The ERO-net was well appreciated. However, the process of voter registration can further be eased after taking cues for the models of voter registration in other successful democracies.

    During the meeting, Sr DEC Shri Umesh Sinha also gave a glimpse of current initiatives undertaken by the Commission like Electoral Literacy Clubs, ERO-Net, RO-Net, Grievance Redressal System etc.
