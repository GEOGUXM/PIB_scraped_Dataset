    A medical checkup and treatment camp for underprivileged children was held at INS Sardar Patel, Porbandar by the unit team (the PMO, six paramedical staff and several volunteers). 75 underprivileged children benefitted from the camp. The social outreach programme was undertaken as a part of the third anniversary celebrations of INS Sardar Patel.


    The camp also provided an opportunity for a healthy and positive interaction between the naval personnel and the children & local volunteers of Porbandar. To enhance the awareness amongst the children, seven naval telefilms were concurrently screened while the camp was in progress. Besides the above activities, the children were also taken on a windshield tour of the base and given refreshments during the camp.
