    The Government organized “Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (GSA)” from 14 th April to 05 th May, 2018 and also extended the campaign to villages having population of more than 1,000 in 117 Aspiration Districts from 1 st June 2018 to 15 th August 2018.


    The campaign, undertaken under the name of “Sabka Sath, Sabka Gaon, Sabka Vikas”, was to promote social harmony, spread awareness about pro-poor initiatives of the government and reach out to poor households to enroll them as also to obtain their feedback on various welfare programmes. As a special endeavor during the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan, saturation of eligible households/persons was envisaged under seven flagship pro-poor programmes, namely, Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, Saubhagya, Ujala scheme, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana and Mission Indradhanush. During GSA, farmers meeting was also organized at block level in rural areas of the country with the aim of “Doubling the farmers’ income till 2022”.


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Rural Development, Shri Ram Kripal Yadav in Lok Sabha today.
