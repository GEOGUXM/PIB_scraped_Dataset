      Posted On: 11 DEC 2018 5:51PM by PIB Delhi


    During the 11th Plan Period in year 2008, Government has piloted a scheme on Smart Card based delivery of Essential Commodities under TPDS in the UT of Chandigarh and Haryana State, through Food and Civil Supplies Departments of respective UT/State. This pilot scheme was stopped due to technical challenges and was subsumed under the plan scheme on ‘End-to-End Computerization of TPDS Operations” which was launched in December 2012 (i.e. 12th plan period). The validity of the scheme has been extended by the Government up to 31.03.2019 for completion of all key activities. The Component-I of the scheme comprise digitization of ration cards/beneficiaries’ database, online allocation of foodgrains, computerization of supply chain management, setting up of transparency portal and grievance redressal mechanisms. Component-II of the scheme comprises automation of Fair Price Shops (FPSs), which involves installation of electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) devices at FPSs for authentication of beneficiaries and electronic recording of sale transactions. As per information received from States/UTs, out of total 5.34 lakh FPSs across the country, more than 3.61 lakh FPSs have been automated so far for foodgrains distribution through authentication on ePoS device


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public, Shri C.R. Chaudhary in Lok Sabha.
