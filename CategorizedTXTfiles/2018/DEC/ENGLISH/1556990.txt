      Use of Fog Safety Devices in Indian Railways
      Posted On: 21 DEC 2018 5:32PM by PIB Delhi


    In the interest of safety of passengers, Indian Railways have to resort to the rescheduling/cancellation of trains due to foggy weather conditions in Northern Parts of the country.


    Fog PASS Device is a Global Positioning System (GPS) based hand held portable device which serves as an aid for the crew during foggy weather through audio visual alarm, whenever any landmark comes within the Geo-fence range. Location of stations, warning boards, signals, level crossing gates and Whistle for Level crossing (W/L) boards in the section is fed in the equipment. It displays speed of the locomotive, distance and time to reach landmarks and is carried by the Loco Pilots. These are being used only in those zones of Indian Railways where the trains pass through fog affected region.


    Details of Fog PASS Devices procured and provided to Zonal Railways, which are affected by foggy weather conditions, are as under:
