      Posted On: 12 DEC 2018 4:01PM by PIB Delhi


    Based on the recommendations of a Committee set up by the Government in pursuance of the judgment of the Supreme Court in 1992 in the Indra Sawhneyâ€™s case to recommend the criteria for exclusion of socially advanced persons/sections from the benefits of reservations for the Other Backward Classes, the Department of Personnel and Training issued an Office Memorandum on 08.09.1993, which was preceded by consultations between the then Ministry of Welfare and the Department of Legal Affairs and was approved by the then Prime Minister.


    The letter dated 14.10.2004 was issued with a view to bring clarity regarding determination of creamy layer on ten specific questions which were then being raised from time to time.


    The earlier unsigned typed copy of the English version of the letter dated 14.10.2004, uploaded on the website of the Department of Personnel & Training had certain discrepancies vis-a vis its Hindi version. When the discrepancy was noticed, the correct copy was uploaded on the website. A corrigendum was also issued on 05.12.2016 when a discrepancy with respect to the explanation under Category VI(b) in the Hindi version of the Office Memorandum dated 08.09.1993 was noticed.


    This was stated by the Minister of State in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions and Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office, Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
