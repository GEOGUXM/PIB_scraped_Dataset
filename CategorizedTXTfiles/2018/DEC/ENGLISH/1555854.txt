      Rural Road Connectivity
      Posted On: 13 DEC 2018 5:46PM by PIB Delhi


    Rural Roads is a State subject and Pradhan Mandri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is a one-time special intervention to provide road connectivity, by way of single all weather road to the eligible unconnected habitations in the Core Network. There is no provision of constructing rail under pass/railway level crossing on railway lines at railway crossing on roads constructed under PMGSY. However, recently Ministry of Railways requested this Ministry that while sanctioning any work of road under PMGSY scheme, suitable provision should be made in the estimate to include provision of a subway to facilitate crossings of railway tracks or road alignment should be planned in such a way that it should connect to the existing level crossing or subway. This Ministry has accordingly requested all the PMGSY implementing States to comply with the advice of the Ministry of Railways in future projects of PMGSY.


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Rural Development, Shri Ram Kripal Yadav in Lok Sabha today.
