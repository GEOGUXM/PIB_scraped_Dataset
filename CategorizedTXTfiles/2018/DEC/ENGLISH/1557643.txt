    The Government has approved Pan-India implementation of Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), a Centrally Sponsored Conditional Cash Transfer Scheme, on 17.05.2017 for implementation across the country with effect from 01.01.2017. The scheme is implemented through web based Management and Information System (MIS) Software, viz. Pradhan MantriMatruVandanaYojana-Common Application Software (PMMVY-CAS) which was launched on 01.09.2017. The effective implementation of the scheme has just completed one year and hence, no impact assessment study of the scheme has been undertaken so far.


    In order to expedite the implementation the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) regional review meeting cum workshops as well as national level workshops are conducted regularly for highest level monitoring. Monitoring is also undertaken through video conferences with all the States/ UTs so as to ensure maximum participation by all officials at the State/ UT level. The scheme is implemented through web based Management and Information System (MIS) Software, viz. Pradhan MantriMatruVandanaYojana-Common Application Software (PMMVY-CAS) which is used as an effective tool for regular monitoring of the scheme.
