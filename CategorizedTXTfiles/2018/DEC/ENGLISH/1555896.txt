    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today chaired a high-level meeting to review progress with regard to "Ease of Doing Business."


    The meeting was attended by senior Union Ministers related to economic matters; Maharashtra Chief Minister Shri Devendra Fadnavis; Lieutenant Governor of Delhi Shri Anil Baijal; and senior officials from the Union Government, Maharashtra Government and Delhi Government.


    The Prime Minister was briefed on progress being made on various parameters related to Ease of Doing Business. Subjects such as construction permits, enforcement of contracts, registering property, starting a business, getting electricity, getting credit, and resolving insolvency came up for discussion.


    India’s rise in the World Bank “Doing Business” rankings from 142 to 77, over the last four years, was taken note of.


    Officials explained the steps being taken to plug shortcomings and resolve bottlenecks in implementing business reforms.


    The Prime Minister stressed on the need to improve last mile delivery, and focus on streamlining procedures, which would improve not just the "Doing Business" rankings, but also increase the "Ease of Living" for small businesses and the common man. He said this is extremely important for India, as an emerging and vibrant economy. He also spoke of the tremendous global interest about the rise in India's "Doing Business" rankings.
