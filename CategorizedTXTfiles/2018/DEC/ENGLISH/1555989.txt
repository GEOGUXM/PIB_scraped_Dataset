    The India Development Update (March 2018) and Global Economic Prospects (June 2018) published by World Bank mention that the temporary disruptions caused by the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax and demonetization have dissipated and the growth of the economy has improved significantly since then. The report mentions that India’s GDP growth bottomed out in the middle of 2017 after slowing for five consecutive quarters, and has since improved significantly, with momentum carrying over into 2018.


    This was stated by Shri Pon Radhakrishnan, Minister of State for Finance in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
