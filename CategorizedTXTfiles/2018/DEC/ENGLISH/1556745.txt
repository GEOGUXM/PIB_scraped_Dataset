    The Ministry of Minority Affairs has implemented PradhanMantri Jan VikasKaryakram (PMJVK) earlier known as MSDP wherein proposals are received from the State Government/UT administrations for construction of infrastructure projects in Minority Concentration Areas for the welfare minorities and other communities living in the catchment area. During the current financial year project proposals from 15 States have been received and consider by the Ministry. Projects having Central Share of Rs. 594.54 crores have been approved so far. State-wise details of the projects approved are available on the website of Ministry at link http://www.minorityaffairs.gov.in/empowered-committee-minutes . No viable project proposal of any State/UT is pending with the Ministry for consideration under PMJVK.


    Funds received by the Ministry by way of budget allocation are allocated among the various welfare schemes implemented during the financial year.
