    COAL PRODUCTION

      * The production of raw coal in the country during April-November 2018-19 was 433.896 Million Tonne (MT) compared to 394.910 MT during the corresponding period of previous year.
      * The overall growth in Coal production during April- November, 2018 was 9.8%.

      * Coal India Limited (CIL) Coal Production and Off-take (during April-November 2018)

          + Coal production and coal dispatch/off-take of Coal India Limited (CIL), the state sector coal mining company, during April-November 2018-19 was 358.322 MT and 392.091 MT respectively.
          + Production and dispatch growth of CIL was 8.8% and 6.6% respectively during April-November 2018-19.
          + Generally, it is observed that coal production slows down considerably between June–September every year.
          + The production has picked up from October onwards.

    In addition to the monitoring mechanism available at coal companies and CIL, coal supplies to Power Utility Sector is monitored regularly by an Inter-Ministerial sub-group comprising representatives of Ministry of Power, Ministry of Coal and Ministry of Railways constituted by Infrastructure review Committee of Cabinet Secretariat. This Sub-Group takes various operational decisions for meeting any contingent situations relating to Power Sector including critical coal stock position for power plant.


    Power Sector Linkage Policy – SHAKTI


    CCEA on 17.05.2017 approved fading away of the existing LoA-FSA regime and introduced Scheme for Harnessing and Allocating Koyala (Coal) Transparently in India (SHAKTI), 2017, which was issued by Ministry of Coal on 22.05.2017. The Policy provides for the following:

      * SHAKTI policy has allowed continuation of the existing coal supply to the capacities of about 68,000 MW at the rate of 75% of Annual Contracted Quantity (ACQ). The coal supply may further be increased in future based on coal availability. Also, the policy has enabled about 19,000 MW capacities out of the 68,000 MW which have delayed in commissioning for signing of Fuel Supply Agreements (FSA) provided these plants are commissioned within 31.03.2022. The plants to whom LoAs were issued have been made eligible for signing of FSAs under para A (i) of SHAKTI Policy. As per Para A (i) of SHAKTI Policy dated 22.05.2017, FSA may be signed with the pending LoA holders after ensuring that the plants are commissioned, respective milestones met, all specified conditions of the LoA fulfilled within specified timeframe and where nothing adverse is detected against the LoA holders.

    With these, the old regime of LoA-FSA came to finality and fade away:


    Following are considered under new more transparent coal allocation policy for Power Sector, 2017-SHAKTI (Scheme for Harnessing and Allocating Koyala (coal) Transparently in India):


    · CIL/ SCCL may grant coal linkages to State/Central Gencos/JVs at notified price on recommendations of Ministry of Power.

      * Linkages to IPPs having PPA based on domestic coal but no linkage.
      * Linkages to IPPs/ Power Producers without PPAs shall be on auction basis where methodology would be similar to that followed under linkage auction to non-regulated sector.
      * Coal linkages may also be earmarked for fresh PPAs, by pre-declaring the availability of coal linkage with description, to the States. States may indicate these linkages to Discoms/ SDAs.
      * Power requirement of group of States can also be aggregated and procurement of such aggregated power can be made by an agency designated by Ministry of Power or authorized by such States on the basis of tariff based bidding.
      * Linkages shall be granted for full normative quantity to Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) incorporated by nominated agency for setting up Ultra Mega Power Projects (UMPP) under Central Government initiative through tariff based competitive under the guidelines for determination of tariff, on the recommendation of MoP.
      * Ministry of Coal in consultation with Ministry of Power may formulate a detailed methodology of a transparent bidding process for allocating coal linkages to IPPs, having PPAs based on imported coal, with full pass through of cost saving to consumers.

    As of now, coal linkages have been granted under Para A (i), B (i) & B (ii) of the aforesaid Policy. During the period of January to November, 2018, 12 Fuel Supply Agreements have been signed by Coal India Limited under the SHAKTI Policy, 2017.


    Details of coal linkages granted under various provisions of SHAKTI as of now are as under:

      * Under paraA(i) of SHAKTI : Clearance has been given for signing of FSA for 6 power plants with a total capacity of 4730 MW.
      * Para B(i) of SHAKTI: 18 TPPs granted linkage for a total capacity of 21880 MW.
      * Para B(ii) of SHAKTI: Linkage auction under para B(ii) of SHAKTI policy was conducted in Sep’17 whereby 27.18 MT of annual coal linkage was booked by ten provisional successful bidders for 9045 MW capacity. Fuel supply Agreement has been executed with seven of ten successful bidders, as of now.

    Auction of Linkages of Non-Regulated Sector


    Policy for Auction of Linkages to Non-Regulated Sector was issued on 15.02.2016. All allocations of Linkages/LoAs for non-regulated sector viz. Cement, Steel/Sponge Iron, Aluminium and others (excluding Fertilizer (urea) sector), including their CPPs, shall be auction based. Till 10 th October, 2018, 71.72 MTPA of coal quantity have been booked under the linkage auctions conducted by Coal India Limited in 4 tranches. The percentage gain over notified price of non-power is 17.90%. Fourth tranche of auction is underway from June, 2018 onwards. A total quantity of 26.54 MT has been booked by Sponge Iron, Cement & CPP sub sector in the fourth tranche of auction till 10 th October, 2018 and the average gain over notified price for the above 3 sub sectors have been 30.25%.


      * Rationalization of Coal Linkage


    An Inter-Ministerial Task Force (IMTF) was constituted in June, 2014 to undertake a comprehensive review of existing sources of coal with a view to optimize transportation cost and materialization under the given technical constraints. The report of the IMTF duly approved by the Competent Authority was circulated to the concerned. On the recommendation of the IMTF, three stage rationalization was undertaken. The linkage rationalization for State/Central PSUs was implemented initially, based on IMTF recommendation and carried forward by CIL based on coal availability and requests of PSU TPPs. Overall movement rationalization of 55.66 MT of coal has taken place with annual potential savings of Rs. 3359 Crore.


    Recently, Ministry of Coal has issued the Policy for Linkage Rationalization for Independent Power Producers (IPPs) vide its letter dated 15.05.2018 which started with rationalization of linkages of State/ Central Gencos. As per this policy, CIL has rationalized for a quantity of 5.42 MT for State/Central Gencos with a potential savings of 292 Crores (approx., as estimated by the power plants) which is under the process of implementation.


    In addition, an Inter Ministerial Task Force has also been constituted on 18.10.2018 to examine the possibility of further rationalization of Coal linkages, including swapping of imported coal being transported to hinterland with domestic coal transported near coastal areas. Four meetings of the IMTF has been held.

      * Bridge Linkage

    Policy for grant of 'Bridge Linkage' to specified end-use plants of Central and State Public Sector Undertakings (Both in Power as well as Non-Power sector) which have been allotted coal mines/ blocks was issued on 08.02.2016. Bridge Linkage shall act like a short term linkage to bridge the gap between requirement of coal of a specified end use plant of Central and State PSUs and the start of production from the linked allotted coal mine/block.

      * Third Party Sampling


    Guidelines on Third Party Sampling at the loading end – Standard Operationg Procedure were issued on 26.11.2015. CIMFR has also been permitted for undertaking of sampling and analysis of coal at unloading / receipt end by the Thermal Power Plants. The progress of the Third Party Sampling is being reviewed periodically by a Committee jointly chaired by Joint Secretary (Coal) and Joint Secretary (Thermal).


    CIMFR has completed signing of tripartite agreement for a quantity of 548 million tonne on annual basis. Sampling for almost entire supply to power utilities under FSA / MoU has already been covered by CIMFR.


    In addition, Third Party sampling has been extended to Non-Power consumers taking coal under different FSAs and e-auction on optional basis. IIT-ISM and QCI have been engaged for undertaking Third Party Sampling for Non-Power consumers and Power consumers taking coal under forward e-auction.


    An APP named as UTTAM (Unlocking Transparency by Third Party Assessment of Mined Coal) has been launched in April, 2018 and all consumer/stakeholders as well as Coal Companies can access the declared grade, third party sample analysis results and referee analysis results through this APP.


    Now, coal supply under all FSAs and e-auction for both power utilities and non-power consumers have been covered under Third Party Sampling. Consumers are now paying the coal value for the quality of coal supplied to them based on analyzed grade given by independent third party agencies.
