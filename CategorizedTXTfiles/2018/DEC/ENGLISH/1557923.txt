      Allowance to Armed Forces
      Posted On: 31 DEC 2018 3:49PM by PIB Delhi


    Taking note of the rigours of military life, the 6 th Central Pay Commission (CPC) had recommended an additional, separate element of Pay for the Defence Forces called Military Service Pay (MSP) which the CPC intended would also maintain the edge enjoyed by the Defence Forces over the civilian scales. The Commission was of the view that the rate of MSP as a percentage of the existing pay has to be maintained in case of officers (up to the level of Brigadier / equivalent) as well as PBORs because the difficulties faced in field situations by both these categories are similar.


    The 7 th Central Pay Commission (CPC) had considered all aspects with regard to applicability of MSP including the rates while making its recommendations. This was done after considering the views of the Services in the matter. The 7 th CPC has consciously decided not to create additional categories of personnel for the grant of MSP or to disturb the slab rates for the four categories for which it is being paid up to the level of Brigadiers. The Government after carefully considering the recommendations of the 7 th CPC in respect of MSP has accepted and notified the same.


    Besides MSP, Service personnel are entitled to several other allowances such as High Altitude Allowance, Field Area / Modified Field Area Allowance, Counter Insurgency Allowance etc which are paid based on risks and hardships involved at a location / in an operation.
