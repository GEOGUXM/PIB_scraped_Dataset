      Posted On: 31 DEC 2018 6:24PM by PIB Delhi


    There has been no decline in India’s export of oilmeals during the last three years and the current year. Soybean meal constitute major share (more than 60%) in export of all oilmeals. Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) on export of soyabean meal has been increased to 10% from 7% from 13 th July, 2018. MEIS is available at the rate of 5% on export of other oilmeals (except groundnut oilmeal).


    The Government has come up with a comprehensive Agriculture Export Policy to boost the export of agricultural products. The Department of Commerce also has several schemes to promote exports, including exports of agricultural products, like Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES), Market Access Initiatives (MAI) Scheme, Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) etc. In addition, assistance to the exporters of agricultural products is also available under the Export Promotion Schemes of Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), Tobacco Board, Tea Board, Coffee Board, Rubber Board and Spices Board. These organisations also seek to promote exports through participation in international fairs & exhibitions, taking initiatives to gain market access for different products in different markets, dissemination of market intelligence, taking steps to ensure quality of exported products etc.
