    Health is a State subject, it is the responsibility of the State to issue such orders/instructions to the healthcare facilities in their respective States/Union Territories. However, with the view to reduce mortality due to road traffic injury, the Central Government have issued ‘Guidelines for protection of Good Samaritans’ to all States/Union Territories wherein it is mentioned that the lack of response by a doctor in an emergency situation pertaining to road accidents, where he is expected to provide care, shall constitute “professional Misconduct” under Chapter 7 of the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulation, 2002 and disciplinary action shall be taken against such doctors under Chapter 8 of the said Regulations.


    With a view to bring down preventable deaths due to road accidents, the Government is implementing the scheme namely ‘Assistance for Capacity Building for Developing Trauma Care Facilities in Govt. Hospitals on National Highways’. Under the Scheme, financial assistance is provided to States/Union Territories (UTs) for upgrading/ strengthening trauma care facilities in identified Government Hospitals/ Medical Colleges.
