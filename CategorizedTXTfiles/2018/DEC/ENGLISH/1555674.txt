(a) Unreserved second class: Normal superfast Mail/Express fares.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                            (b) Reserved Class: Minimum fare is Tatkal fare for initial 20% of the berths and thereafter the fare increases for subsequent slabs of 20% of seats/berths booked subject to maximum three times of the Tatkal fare.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

    From above it may be seen that no increase in fare for second class (unreserved). However for other classes higher fares have been fixed in view of investments for the coaches, empty running of certain rakes/locos from one location to another, arrangements of spare Guard/loco pilots, special arrangements for stabling/maintenance of the rakes and in certain cases unidirectional demand pattern etc.
