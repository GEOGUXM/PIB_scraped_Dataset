    Textiles industry in India is one of the largest in the world with a huge raw material base and manufacturing strength across all value chains.The strength of India’s textiles industry lies both in the hand woven sector as well as mill sector. Traditional sectors like handloom, handicrafts and small scale power loom are the biggest source of employment for millions of people in rural and semi-urban areas. This industry contributes to 7% of industrial output in value terms, 2% of India’s GDP and 15% of the country’s export earnings.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
  “Today’s competitive world demands quick- time response in shaping initiatives to address the challenges of growth and converting them into opportunities. To this end, the Ministry of Textiles has been working relentlessly to ensure a conducive policy environment, facilitating enabling editions for the industry and private entrepreneurs to set up units through its various policy initiatives and schemes.”

    SILK INDUSTRY


    Integrated Scheme for Development of Silk Industry:The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approvedthe Central Sector Scheme "Integrated Scheme for Development of Silk Industry" for three years from 2017-18 to 2019-20. The Scheme has four components:

      * Research & Development (R&D), training, transfer of technology and IT initiatives
      * Seed organizations and farmers’ extension centres
      * Coordination and market development for seed, yarn and silk products and
      * Quality Certification System (QCS) by creating amongst others a chain of silk testing facilities, farm based & post-cocoon technology up-gradation, and export brand promotion.

    The story of silk begins with cocoons


    The scheme with atotal allocation of Rs.2161.68 crore is expected to increase the silk production from the level of 30348 MTs during 2016-17 to 38500 MTs by the end of 2019-20 with the following interventions:


    • Production of import substitute bivoltine silk to the tune of 8500 MTs per annum by 2020.


    • R&D to improve productivity from the present level of 100 Kgs to 111 kgs of silk per hectare of plantation by the end of 2019-20.


    • Large scale propagation of improved reeling machines (automatic reeling machine for mulberry, improved reeling and spinning machineries and Buniyaad reeling machines for Vanya silk) under Make in India programme to produce quality silk to cater to the market demand.


    The scheme will promote women empowerment and livelihood opportunities for SC and ST and other weaker sections of the society. It will help to increase productive employment from 85 lakhs to 1 crore persons by 2020.The scheme aims to achieve self-sufficiency in silk production by 2022. To achieve this, production of high grade silk in India will reach 20,650 MTs by 2022 from the current level of 11,326 MTs thereby reducing imports to Zero. It is proposed to increase 4A grade silk from the current level of 15% to 25 % of mulberry production by 2020. The implementation strategy is clearly based on convergence at the State level with the schemes of other Ministers like MGNREGS of Rural Development, RKVY & PMKSY of Ministry of Agriculture, for maximizing benefits to the sericulturists. The R&D projects pertaining to disease resistant silkworm, host plant improvements, productivity enhancing tools and implements for reeling and waving will be done in cooperation with Ministries of Science and Technology, Agriculture and Human Resource Development (HRD).


    New Races of Silk Worm Seed:


    Central Silk Board (CSB) has notified newly developed races of silkworm seed of mulberry and Vanya silk for increasing the productivity of cocoons and to increase the income of the farmers engaged in sericulture. Silk worm breeds for specific agro-climatic condition are essential for increasing the productivity of cocoons.


    Tropical Tasar Silkworm (BDR-10) race developed have 21% more productivity than the traditional Daba breed. Farmers can get upto 52 kg cocoons per 100 disease free layings (dfls). Thissilkworm breed will help the tribal farmers of Jharkhand, Chattishgarh, Odisha, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Maharastra, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.


    Multivoltine x Bivoltine Mulberry hybrid(PM x FC2) race of silkworm can produce 60 kg per 100 Dfls and the race is better than earlier race PM x CSR. Due to high quality silk and significant egg recovery, this race is suitable for the farmers of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Maharashtra.


    Erisilkworm (C2) race can produce 247 numbers of Eri cocoons per 100 Dfls. This is suitable for the farmers in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Maharastra, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Sikkim, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal.


    Central Silk Board under the Ministry of Textiles is engaged in applied research for developing new breeds of races of silkworm seed and conducts extensive field trial before commercial use in the field.


    INTEGRATED SKILL DEVELOPMENT SCHEME (ISDS):


    ‘Samarth’- Scheme for Capacity Building in Textile Sector:


    Union Minister of Textiles, SmritiZubinIrani, chaired a meeting of stakeholders on Samarth – Scheme for Capacity Building in Textile Sector under the Skill India Mission in May, 2018 in New Delhi, to familiarize the stakeholders about the scheme and its guidelines. The broad objective of the new scheme is to skill the youth for gainful and sustainable employment in the textiles sector covering the entire value chain of textiles, excluding spinning and weaving.


    The concerns of the stakeholders and challenges faced by them during implementation of the previous scheme were discussed in the meeting. Feedback from the concerned stakeholders on how the scheme can contribute and benefit the textiles industry and boost skill development was also discussed.


    The guidelines of the scheme were released on 23 rd of April 2018. The scheme was approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on 20 th of December 2017 with an outlay of Rs. 1300 crore. It is intended to provide demand driven, placement oriented National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF) compliant skilling programmes to incentivize and supplement the efforts of the industry in creating jobs in the textiles sector. The scheme targets to train 10 lakh persons (9 lakh in organised and 1 lakh in traditional sector) over a period of 3 years (2017-20).


    The Integrated Skill Development Scheme (ISDS) was introduced by the Ministry of Textiles as a pilot scheme in the last two years of XI Five Year Plan (FYP) with an outlay of Rs. 272 crore, including Rs. 229 crore as Government contribution with a physical target to train 2.56 lakh persons. The scheme was scaled up as main phase during the XIIth FYP with an allocation of Rs. 1,900 crore to train 15 lakh persons. The ISDS addresses the critical gap of skilled manpower in textile industry through industry-oriented training programmes. It is implemented through three components where major thrust is given to PPP mode where a partnership has been developed with the industry in establishing a demand-driven skilling ecosystem. The scheme has been largely aligned with the common norms of Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship.


    Skill Development in Textiles sector

      * Total 11,14,545 persons were trained under the scheme mainly in apparel and garmenting (86%) with total expenditure of Rs. 935.17 crore, of which 8,43,082 persons (75.64%) were given employment in the textile sector.

    NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FASHION TECHNOLOGY (NIFT)


    NIFT students receiving certificates from Textiles Minister


    Indiasize, a National Sizing Survey will be conducted by the National Institute of Fashion Technology(NIFT), New Delhi, to develop a comprehensive size chart for ready-to-wear industry based on the body measurements of the Indian population. It is a scientific exercise where anthropometric data will be collected from a sample population in the age group 15 to 65 years to create a database of measurements that will result in a standardized size chart which is representative of the Indian population and can be adopted by the apparel industry. The surveys entail measuring statistically relevant sample size pan country using human safe technology of 3D whole body scanner, a non-contact method of taking body measurements and analyzing the collected data to create size charts.


    The project will entail measuring of 25,000 male and female Indians in 6 cities in 6 regions of the country: Kolkata(East), Mumbai(West), New Delhi(North), Hyderabad(Central India), Bengaluru(South) and Shillong (North-East). Using 3D whole body scanners, computers will extract hundreds of measurements from a scan. The data created as part of this project will be confidential and secure. The duration of the project will be around two years from the date of commencement.


    Providing well-fitting garments in the absence of standardized size chart is proving to be a big challenge for the domestic textile and apparel industry which is projected to reach USD 123 billion by 2021 and holds 5 th position in apparel imports.


    A large percentage of shoppers face difficulty in finding clothes that fit perfectly according to their body measurements. The reason is differences in anthropometric built of people in different geographical regions across the country. Till date 14 countries have successfully completed national sizing surveys: USA, Canada, Mexico, UK, France, Spain, Germany, Korea, China and Australia.


    Indian apparel industry uses size charts which are tweaked versions of size charts of other countries so returns of the garments are in the range of 20% to 40% and is increasing with the growth of ecommerce and the main reason for returns are poor garment fit.


    The findings of the study will impact various other sectors like automotive, aerospace, fitness and sport, art and computer gaming where insights from this data can produce ergonomically designed products which are suited for the Indian population.
