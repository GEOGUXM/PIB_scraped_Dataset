    Safety is accorded the highest priority by Indian Railways and all possible steps are undertaken on a continual basis to prevent accidents and to enhance Safety. The following steps are taken to prevent rail accidents due to fog and other reasons :-

     1. To provide safeguard in train operation in Automatic Block System during foggy weather, the number of trains are restricted to two between two stations.
     2. Reducing the speed of trains.
     3. During fog, when Loco pilot feels that visibility is restricted, he runs at a speed at which he can control the train so as to be prepared to stop short of any obstruction.
     4. Deputing additional staff to alert the Loco Pilot through placement of detonators before the First Stop signal.
     5. Improving the visibility of signals.
     6. Loco Pilots are advised to take precautions, be vigilant and alert and to observe Special Rules and instructions regarding speed limits under foggy conditions.
     7. Fog PASS Device, a Global Positioning System (GPS) based hand held portable device, is used. This device is not installed on a locomotive as such but is given to Loco Pilots in fog affected sections. It serves as an aid for the crew during foggy weather through audio visual alarm, whenever any landmark comes within the geo-fence range.
     8. Extensive footlplate inspections by officers and supervisors, particularly during night hours are being ensured.
     9. Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK) - As announced by Hon’ble Minister of Finance in his Budget Speech for 2017-18, a fund namely ‘Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK)’ had been introduced with a corpus of ₹1 lakh crore over a period of five years from 2017-18 onwards for critical safety related works. A provision of ₹20,000 crore has been made in Budget Estimate 2018-19 out of ‘RRSK’, as was done in 2017-18. The Funds under RRSK are being utilized to finance works under Plan heads Traffic Facilities, Rolling Stock, Level Crossing, ROB/RUB, Track Renewal, Bridge Works, Signal and Telecommunication Works, other Electrical Works, TRD Works, Machinery and Plant, Workshop and Training/HRD.
    10. Expenditure on safety has increased consistently from ₹45516 Cr. in 2015-16 to ₹53457 Cr. in 2016-17, ₹60885 Cr. in 2017-18 and further ₹73065 Cr. (Budget Estimate) in 2018-19.
    11. Topmost priority is given to Rail/Track renewal by making available funds and material for rail renewal. Further adequate traffic blocks for carrying out work are also being provided.
    12. Switch over to the manufacture of Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches from 2018-19 onwards and stopping the manufacture of ICF coaches. The LHB coaches having superior design and better safety features like anti-climbing features etc.
    13. Elimination of unmanned level crossings on Broad Gauge through closure, merger, provision of subways and manning, etc. Upto November, 2018 all the unmanned level crossings (UMLC) have been eliminated on Broad Gauge except a very small number i.e. 28 UMLCs.
    14. New works have been included in the category of Safety works like Platform extension and raising, foot overbridge, pathways and boundary walls etc. to improve passenger safety.
    15. Delegation of powers and easing of procedures, improving safety awareness amongst railway employees, and better training facilities like imparting simulator based training for improving the driving skills and the reaction time of Loco Pilots.
