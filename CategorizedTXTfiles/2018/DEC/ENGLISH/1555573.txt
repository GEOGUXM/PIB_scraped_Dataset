    State-wise details of sown area under sugarcane crops during each of the last three years i.e. from 2015-16 to 2017-18 are given at Annexure.


    The normal area (average of latest five years) under sugarcane cultivation in the country is 48.84 lakh hectares. During 2015-16 area under sugarcane was estimated above the normal area coverage at 49.27 lakh hectares. The area under sugarcane declined to 44.36 lakh hectares during 2016-17 due to lesser area coverage in Maharashtra and then increased to 47.32 lakh hectares during 2017-18.


    The area under sugarcane cultivation depends on farmerâ€™s preference, shift of area to other competing crops, agro-climatic conditions, inter-crop profitability, irrigation facilities, and resource availability with farmers and timely payment of cane dues to farmers by the mills etc.


    To enhance production and productivity of sugarcane in the country, the Government has been implementing Sugarcane Development Programme under National Food Security Mission - Commercial Crops (NFSM-CC) in 13 major sugarcane growing states of the country viz. Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh,Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh from 2014-15. Under this scheme thrust has been given on transfer of technology through frontline demonstrations and training in order to extend benefits to the farmers. The components under NFSM-CC Sugarcane includes demonstration on inter-cropping and single bud chip technology with sugarcane, assistance for breeder seed production, production / supply of tissue culture plantlets/seedlings, distribution of plant protection chemicals and bio-agents, etc. The Central Government also fixes Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane, well in advance of sowing season, to induce farmers to sow sugarcane. FRP is a minimum benchmark price below which sugar mills cannot purchase cane from the cane growers.


    The states can also support Sugarcane Development Programme under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) with the approval of State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLCC).
