      Posted On: 12 DEC 2018 5:26PM by PIB Delhi


    Government has planned to remove or man all unmanned level crossings (UMLCs) on Broad Gauge (BG). As on 01.04.2018, there were 5792 unmanned level crossings out of which 3479 were on Broad Gauge, 1135 on Meter Gauge and 1178 on Narrow Gauge.


    Elimination of UMLCs has been a top priority for Railways as level crossings are a safety hazard for both rail and road users more so for road users. As on 01.04.2014, there were 8948 UMLCs on BG. It is submitted that all UMLCs on BG have now been eliminated except 28 UMLCs which have also been planned to be eliminated by closure, merger, subway and manning.


    This information was given by the Minister of State of Railways, Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
