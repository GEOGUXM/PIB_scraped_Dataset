Products like fibre, yarn and fabric in the textile value chain are being strengthened and made competitive through various schemes, likePowertex for fabric segment, Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (ATUFS) for all segments except spinning and Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP) for all segments. Assistance is provided to exporters under Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme. Further, Government has enhanced interest equalization rate for pre and post shipment credit for certain textile sectors from 3% to 5% from 2.11.2018.
