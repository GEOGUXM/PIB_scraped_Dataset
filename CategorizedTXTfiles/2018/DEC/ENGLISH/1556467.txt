    As per the latest publish report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Conviction Rate (CVR) of IPC crimes at national level during 2014 - 2016 is as under :

                           
Year  Conviction Rate (CVR)
                           
                           
                           
2014  45.1                 
                           
                           
                           
2015  46.9                 
                           
                           
                           
2016  46.8                 
                           
                           

    Lack of Witness Protection is one of the reasons amongst others for low conviction rate. Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India and State Governments are responsible for prevention, detection, registration and investigation of crime and for prosecuting the criminals through their law enforcement agencies. The Ministry of Home Affairs have issued advisories to the States and UTs, from time to time, to maintain law and order. These advisiories are available in the Ministry’s website viz www.mha.gov.in . However, a Witness Protection Scheme, 2018 was prepared by the Ministry of Home Affairs and submitted to the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India; Hon’ble Supreme Court in its order dated 5.12.2018 in the Writ Petition No. 156/2016 has approved the said Witness Protection Scheme, 2018. The scheme has come into effect from the date of the Judgement.


    This was stated by the Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
