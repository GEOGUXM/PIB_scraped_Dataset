    Inland Water Transport (IWT) mode is widely recognized as an environment friendly and cost effective mode of transport. As per RITES Report of 2014 on Integrated National Waterways Transportation Grid, 1 litre of fuel moves 24 tonne - km on road, 95 tonne-km on rail and 215 tonne-km on IWT. The cost of movement of freight by the three modes of transport is given below:

                                            
Mode                Railways  Highways  IWT 
                                            
                                            
                                            
Freight (Rs./T.km)  1.36      2.50      1.06
                                            
                                            

    In addition to the economic and environmental benefits, IWT aims to create for the shippers and logistic players, an alternative to the two dominant modes of transport i.e. road and rail.
