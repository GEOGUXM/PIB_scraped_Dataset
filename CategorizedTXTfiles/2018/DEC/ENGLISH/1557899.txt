      Benefits of PMUY Extended to Poor Families
      Posted On: 31 DEC 2018 2:54PM by PIB Delhi


    Pradhan Mantri UjjwalaYojana (PMUY) is currently under implementation across the country. As on 26.12.2018, more than 5.89 crore connections have been released under PMUY. State/UT-wise details are at Annexure.


    As on 26.12.2018, OMCs have released more than 5.89 crore LPG connections under PMUY consumers. Earlier, the beneficiaries under PMUY were identified either from SECC list or from seven other identified categories. Now, the Government has decided to extend the benefit to all left out poor families underPMUY, subject to fulfilment of terms & conditions.


    OMCs have reported very minuscule number of cases of established irregularities in providing gas connections to BPL households under PMUY since launch of the Scheme. OMCs have taken punitive action as per the extant Marketing Discipline Guidelines (MDG) and the Distributorship Agreement against LPG distributors in all the established cases of irregularities.


    Implementation of PMUY is monitored closely in terms of number of beneficiaries identified and the actual number of connections released vis-a-vis LPG coverage in States/Districts. The difficulties faced by OMCs mainly relate to identification of households, difficult terrain, low awareness on usefulness of LPG etc. The Government has taken up the matter with concerned State Governments. Further, OMCs have launched awareness programme through print and electronic media highlighting the benefit of usage of LPG.


    As on 01.12.2018, there are 22,328 LPG distributors in the country. Further, with a view to strengthen the LPG distribution infrastructure, OMCs had advertised more than 6400 locations across the country, which are mostly in rural areas.


    This information was given by Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan in a written reply to the Lok Sabha today.
