      Posted On: 13 DEC 2018 10:55AM by PIB Delhi

    Latest satellite imageries and surface observations indicate that a depression has formed over southeast Bay of Bengal and lay centred at 0530 hrs IST of today, the 13 th December, 2018 near latitude 6.5°N and longitude 88.7°E, about 850 km east-southeast of Trincomalee (Sri Lanka), 1170 km southeast of Chennai (Tamil Nadu) and 1350 km south-southeast of Machilipatnam (Andhra Pradesh). It is very likely to intensify further into a deep depression during next 12 hours and into a Cyclonic Storm during the subsequent 24 hours. It is very likely to move northwestwards towards Andhra Pradesh & adjoining north Tamil Nadu coast during next 72 hours.


    Forecast track and intensity are given in the following table:
