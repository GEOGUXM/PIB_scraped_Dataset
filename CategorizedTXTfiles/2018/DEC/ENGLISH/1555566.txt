      Increase in MSP
      Posted On: 12 DEC 2018 12:03PM by PIB Delhi


    Government fixes Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) of 22 mandated Kharif and Rabi crops and Fair & Remunerative Prices (FRP) for Sugarcane on the basis of recommendations of Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP), after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned & other relevant factors. In addition, MSP for Toria and De-Husked coconut is also fixed on the basis of MSPs of Rapeseed/Mustard and Copra respectively.


    Government generally increases the MSPs of all notified crops which provide adequate return over cost of production. Government has increased MSPs substantially for all mandated crops for the season 2018-19 . This decision of the Government was a historic one as it fulfills the commitment to the farmers to provide 50 per cent return over cost of production for the first time for all mandated crops. Details of MSP, cost and percent return over cost for 2016-17, 2017-18 & 2018-19 is given at Annexure.


    While recommending MSPs, CACP considers a host of factors including all India weighted average cost of production of crops. The costs considered are comprehensive and include all paid out costs such as those incurred on account of hired human labour, bullock labour/machine labour, rent paid for leased in land, expenses incurred in cash and kind on use of material inputs like seeds, fertilizers, manures, irrigation charges, depreciation on implements and farm buildings, interest on working capital, diesel/electricity for operation of pump sets etc, miscellaneous expenses and imputed value of family labour. The MSPs fixed by Government for most of the crops provide atleast a return of 50 per cent over cost of production for the year 2018-19.
