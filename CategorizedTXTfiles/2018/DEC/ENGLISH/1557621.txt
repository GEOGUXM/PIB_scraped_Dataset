      Posted On: 28 DEC 2018 4:23PM by PIB Delhi


    Under the Strengthening of Tertiary Care Cancer facilities scheme under National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, CVD and Stroke (NPCDCS), financial assistance is provided for setting up of State Cancer Institutes (SCIs) and Tertiary Care Cancer Centres (TCCCs) in different parts of the country. The maximum permissible assistance for SCI is Rs. 120 crores and for TCCC is Rs. 45 crores, which includes State share of 40%, except for North-Eastern and Himalayan States where the State share is 10%. Assistance under this scheme is for procurement of radio therapy equipment, diagnostic equipment, surgical equipment, enhancement of indoor patient facility for cancer and such other purposes relevant for diagnosis, treatment and care of cancer. Upto 30% of the approved cost can be used for construction.


    Health is a State subject. The Central Government supplements the efforts of the State Governments to prevent and control cancer and to provide affordable and accessible care.


    A request was received from the Government of Maharashtra for setting up TCCC at BKL Walawalkar Hospital Diagnostic & Research Centre in Ratnagiri district. However, under the scheme, two TCCCs were envisaged to be set up in Maharashtra and the proposals for the same have already been approved at RashtrasantTukdoji Regional Cancer Hospital & Research Centre, Nagpur and Vivekanand Medical Foundation & Research Centre, Latur, as per the recommendations of the State Government and first installment of the Central share has also been released.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
