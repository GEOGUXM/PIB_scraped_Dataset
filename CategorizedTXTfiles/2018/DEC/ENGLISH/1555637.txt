Since then, the Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) are competent to take appropriate decision on pricing of petrol and diesel in line with international product prices and other market conditions. Other cost elements in the Retail Selling Prices (RSP) of petrol & diesel are Excise Duty, VAT, BS IV premium, marketing cost and margins, dealers Commission etc. The OMCs have not only increased but also decreased the prices accordingly.
