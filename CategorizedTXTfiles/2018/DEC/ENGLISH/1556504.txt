      Posted On: 18 DEC 2018 5:26PM by PIB Delhi


    The National Steel Policy 2017 and Domestically Manufactured Iron & Steel Products Policy 2017, has led to huge growth in both production and consumption of steel. The per capita consumption has risen from 59 kgs in 2013-14 to 69 kgs in 2017-18. India has produced 103 Million Tonnes of steel in 2017-18 and will soon become the second largest producer of steel in the world in the year 2018. The capacity of steel production has increased from 97 Million Tonnes in 2012-13 to 138 Million Tonnes in 2017-18.The Government of India’s emphasis and commitment to building infrastructure,Make-in-India and Smart City Mission has led to the consumption of steel growing dramatically. More than 50% production is in the secondary steel sector comprising of small producers spread across the country employing a large number of people directly or indirectly.


      * Ministry of steel is promoting rural and urban development through low cost housing designs by INSDAG and various other structures like bridges, culverts, anganwadis, panchayat halls and community toilet.

      * Ministry of Steel has in collaboration with M/o Railways, Road Transport, Rural Development, Environment and Forest, Coal and Consumer Affairs increased steel usage and fast tracking of steel projects.

    Use of Steel in Indian Railway tracks

      * The Ministry of Steel utilized MyGov platform to crowd source ideas for increasing steel consumption in India.
      * A contest was conducted inviting ideas in steel sector called #myLOVESTEELideas:

    The first prize was awarded to Sumit Gupta from Delhi for his idea of Steel based expandable tiny homes for providing low cost basic housing with solar panels and bio toilets.


    Second Prize was awarded to HareeshS. from Thiruvanthapuram for his idea of designs for Stainless steel waste bin, incorporating enclosed segregated storage and with provisions for advertising space.


    Third prize was awarded to VasimMalek from Nadiad City , Gujarat for his idea of laying underground permanent steel utility ducting along roads and in apartments for eliminating disruption of daily life of citizens due to repeated digging up.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Flagship programmes like 100 Smart Cities Mission, Housing for all Mission, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation and high-speed bullet trains and metro trains all will hugely contribute in increasing steel demand in our country.
