    Inland Waterways Authority of India ( IWAI) has put in place a structured management and monitoring system with competent and experienced professionals, to ensure that the projects on NWs are qualitatively executed in a time bound manner. In addition, the progress of execution of projects is regularly reviewed at various levels within IWAI and the Government.


    Inland Water Transport ( IWT) mode is widely recognized as environment friendly and cost effective mode of transport. As per RITES Report of 2014 on Integrated National Waterways Transportation Grid, some of the important benefits of IWT mode compared to rail and road transportation are fuel efficiency and cost savings as given below:


     1. 1 Litre of fuel moves 24 tonne - km on road, 95 tonne-km on rail and 215 tonne-km on IWT.

     2. Comparative cost for movement of freight.

    In addition to the economic and environmental benefits, IWT aims to create for the shippers and logistic players, an alternative to the two dominant modes of transport viz. road and rail.


    Minister of State for Shipping Shri Pon Radhakrishnan gave this information in reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
