      Posted On: 27 DEC 2018 5:42PM by PIB Delhi


    The wind power projects in the country are installed on the basis of commercial viability through tariff based competitive bidding process. As on date, the bids for setting up of wind power projects of aggregate 8389.90 MW capacity have been finalised through Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd. (SECI) and National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd. (NTPC), as detailed in Annexure-II . Besides, bids of 500 MW each have been finalised by the states of Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Maharashtra.


    The Government has set a target of installing 60 GW of wind power capacity by 2022, against which 35 GW capacity has already been installed. The state wise installed capacity and energy generation (actual production) of wind power in the country during last three years and current year are given in Annexure -I .


    The Government is promoting wind power projects in entire country by providing various fiscal and financial incentives such as Accelerated Depreciation benefit; concessional custom duty exemption on certain components of wind electric generators. Besides, Generation Based Incentive (GBI) is being provided to the wind projects commissioned before 31 March 2017.


    In addition to fiscal and other incentives as stated above, following steps also have been taken to promote installation of wind capacity in the country:

      * Technical support including wind resource assessment and identification of potential sites through the National Institute of Wind Energy, Chennai.
      * In order to facilitate inter-state sale of wind power, the inter-state transmission charges and losses have been waived off for wind and solar projects to be commissioned by March, 2022.
      * Issued Guidelines for Tariff Based Competitive Bidding Process for procurement of Power from Grid Connected Wind Power Projects. These Guidelines aim to enable the Distribution Licensees to procure wind power at competitive rates in a cost effective manner.

    This was informed by Minister of State (I/C) for New and Renewable Energy and Power Shri R. K Singh in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
