    Indian Railways is committed to make India accessible for Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan) as part of “Sugamya Bharat Mission” or Accessible India Campaign of Government of India. Improvement/augmentation of amenities at Railway stations, including those for differently abled passengers is a continuous process. Provisions of facilities for Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan) are to be provided at all stations over Indian Railways. The categorization of station is reviewed every five years. In April,2018, it has been decided to change the categorization of Station from ‘A-1’, ‘A’ & ‘B’, (C0, ‘D’, ‘E’ & ‘F’ category to NSG1 - NSG6, SG1 – SG3 & HG1 – HG3 based upon passenger handled and earnings of the stations. In order to provide better accessibility to Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan), Short Term Facilities and Long Terms facilities have been planned at all stations, beginning with Non Suburban Group ‘NSG 1’, ‘NSG 2’, ‘NSG 3’ & ‘NSG 4’ (erstwhile ‘A-1’, ‘A’ & ‘B’) category stations.
