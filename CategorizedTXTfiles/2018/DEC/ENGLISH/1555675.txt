      Posted On: 12 DEC 2018 5:25PM by PIB Delhi


    All electrified Railway stations other than those in gauge conversion have already been provided with 100% LED luminaries by 30.03.2018. Also, 99% of service buildings have been provided with 100% LED lights over Indian Railways.


    Use of 100% LED lights will reduce energy consumption for non-traction purpose by about 10%. This will be equivalent to about 240 million units of electricity per annum.


    This information was given by the Minister of State of Railways, Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
