      Posted On: 17 DEC 2018 6:06PM by PIB Delhi


    As on 01.04.2018, 30,212 Route Kilometers (RKM) of Indian Railways are electrified and electrification work is in progress on 33,658 Route Kilometers which includes 13,675 Route Kilometers sanctioned in September, 2018.


    To reduce dependence on imported diesel fuel and carbon emission Indian Railways have already embarked upon a major programme to speed up electrification of Railway Lines. Achievements of Railway Electrification in last years and Planning of the current and next three years is as below:-

    The sanctioned cost of electrification of balance 33,658 Route Kilometers is ` 29,486 crore.


    With complete electrification of BG routes of Indian Railways following savings will accrue:-


    (i) Energy bill of Indian Railway will reduce by about ` 13000 crore/annum.


    (ii) Consumption of fossil fuel (Diesel) will reduce by about 2.8 billion liters which will result in saving of foreign exchange.
