    NITI Aayog has set up an Apex Committee and five Task Forces under it for carrying out R&D activities and developing roadmap for implementing Methanol Economy in India. Task Force on Production of Methanol using High Ash Coal is one of them. The Government has notified G.S.R 490(E) dated 24.05.2018 regarding Mass emission standards for flex-fuel Methanol M15 or M100 and Methanol MD 95 vehicles.


    I ndia imported 212.7 Million Tons of Crude oil in 2016-2017. It is estimated that a 15% methanol blending can result in replacement of around 31.9 million tons of crude oil. With increasing crude oil prices, it can result in significant savings for India. Further the CO and HC emission reduction for M 15 as compared to neat gasoline by approximate 40 % is an added benefit. Further CO2 and evaporative emission benefits are also envisaged. With NITI Aayogâ€™s initiatives, Department of Science & Technology has sanctioned R&D projects on demonstration of two plants (1 TPD each) for production of methanol using high ash coal one at Thermax Ltd., Pune, and another at BHEL, Hyderabad and are progressing well.


    This information was given by Union Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways Shri Mansukh L Mandaviya in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
