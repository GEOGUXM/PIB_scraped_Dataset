    The major reasons for the decline in exports are due to external factors namely recession in the major market of European Union (to which about 55% of exports are directed), instability in middle-east, stiff competition from Polyurethane Garments to the Leather Garments segment, decrease in demand of non-leather footwear in African countries due to emergence of production centres in those countries and competition from China and decrease in global imports of finished leather.


    This information was given by the Minister of State of Commerce and Industry, C. R. Chaudhary, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha.
