    There is a proposal under consideration of the Government to bring “Sports” under concurrent List from State List. In this regard, the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports (Department of Sports) has sought comments from the concerned Ministries/Departments as well as Governments of States/UTs.


    The main objective of shifting “Sports” from State List to Concurrent List is to enable the Central Government to provide for a robust comprehensive framework for sports.


    All sports promotional schemes of Department of Sports are applicable to whole country irrespective of area and gender. However, some schemes of the Ministry have specific component for increasing the participation of women and youth from tribal areas in sports.


    Continuous efforts are made to increase the participation of women and youth from tribal areas in the sports. The participation of number of girls trainees under SAI Schemes have increased from 3530 (2015-16) to 4031 (2016-17) to 4426 (2017-18).
