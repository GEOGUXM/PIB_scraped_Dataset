    The year 2018 has been a significant one for the Ministry of Shipping. Bolstered by progressive policy interventions like amendment of Model Concession Agreement, revision of tariff guidelines and the various steps taken towards facilitating Ease of Doing Business, the major ports kept up their impressive performance of the past four years in terms of capacity addition and improvement of efficiency parameters.


    The SagarmalaProgramme saw the completion of 89 projects, while 443 projects worth Rs. 4.32 lakh crore are under various stages of implementation and development.


    The year was especiallyremarkable for developments in the inland water transport sector. The inauguration of the multi modal terminal on River Ganga at Varanasi by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the first ever post - independence movement of container cargo from Kolkata to Varanasi on the river, and the commencement of integrated movement of cargo from Kahalgaon in Bihar to Pandu in Assamover three waterways – Ganga, Brahmaputra and the Indo Bangladesh Protocol Route, have firmly established that the vision of inland water as a cheaper and more environment friendly mode of transport is fast becoming a reality.


    Cruise tourism was another area with important developments like the inauguration of a modernized international cruise terminal at Chennai Port and the launch of Mumbai-Goa cruise service, as was the skill development sector with the setting up of Centre of Excellence in Maritime & Shipbuilding (CEMS) at Vizag and Mumbai, National Technology Centre for Ports, Waterways and Coasts (NTCPWC), at IIT Madras in Chennai and the decision to set up Multiskill Development Centers (MSDC) at all major ports under Sagarmala.


    The paragraphs below give the sector-wise details of the major work done by the Ministry during the year.

    1.6 Policy initiatives


    The achievement of the Major Ports in terms of capacity augmentation, improved operational efficiency and higher operating surplus has been made possible due to certain pro-active policy initiatives taken by the Ministry of Shipping as explained below.

     1. The Model Concession Agreement has been amended with a view to obviate the problems being faced in execution of PPP Projects on account of certain provisions of the present MCA, in order to enhance confidence of investors and make the investments in the Port Sector attractive.
     2. The tariff guidelines were revised to provide flexibility to port operators to align the tariff closer to market tariff subject to achievement of certain performance standards.
     3. 100% FDI is being allowed in PPP Projects in the Port Sector.
     4. A new Major Ports Authorities Bill to replace existing Major Port Trusts Act 1963 to provide greater autonomy and modernization of institutional structure is under consideration and has been introduced in the Lok Sabha on 16.12.2016. This is awaiting consideration and passing by the Lok Sabha.
      * v. Revised guidelines have been issued to all the Major Ports for moving away from the practice of parking their surplus funds solely in the Public Sector Banks and investing their pension /provident/gratuity fund and surplus funds in accordance with guidelines of Ministry of Labour and Employment and Department of Public Enterprises, consistent with the provisions of Major Port Trusts Act, 1963.

    1.7 Ease of Doing Business


    As per the World Bank report 2019 on Ease of Doing Business, India has taken a huge leap of 23 ranks from 100 in 2017-18 to 77 in 2018-19 indicating it is continuing its steady shift towards global standards. Towards facilitating ‘Ease of Doing Business (EoDB)’, Ministry of Shipping had identified various parameters for reducing dwell time and transaction costs in the Major Ports. These include elimination of manual forms, accommodation for laboratories to Participating Government Agencies (PGAs), Direct Port Delivery, Installation of Container Scanners, E-delivery orders; RFID based Gate-automation System, etc. These initiatives have already been implemented at Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JN Port) and are being taken up in other Major Ports.


    Elimination of manual Forms has cut down long queues and waiting time for containers at the port gate and enabled faster evacuation of EXIM cargo and reduced congestion at port gates.The RFID solution has been implemented in all Major Ports to enhance security, remove bottlenecks for seamless movement of traffic across port gates, ensure tracking & tracing of man, material, vehicle, equipment, & other assets, and collection of revenue as per the notified rates.


    A centralized web-based Port Community System (PCS) has been operationalized across all Major Ports which enables seamless data flow between the various stakeholders viz. Customs, CFSs, Shipping Lines &ICDs,Lines/Agents, Surveyors, Stevedores, Banks, Container Freight Stations, Government regulatory agencies, Customs House agents, Importers, Exporters, CONCOR/Railways, etc. through common interface. The present system PCS 1.0 has been upgraded to PCS 1x .


    Ministry of Shipping has issued an order dated 27.3.2018 making use of e-invoice, e-payment and e-delivery order mandatory for all stakeholders across all Major Ports, all terminals within the Major Ports, private ports, private terminals and CFSs/ICDs.


    Logistics Data Bank Service under Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor Development Corporation Ltd. (DMICDC), for enabling track & trace movement of EXIM container has been implemented at JNPT and is being implemented at other Major Ports.


    JN Port is the first port to start Direct Port Delivery (DPD) and Direct Port Entry (DPE). DPD has increased from 5.42 % in March 2016 to 41.92% in August, 2018. In JNPT the percentage of Direct Port Entry of Export containers increased from 60% to 76.98% in August, 2018. The exporters are currently benefitted by savings in cost of about Rs.2,000/- per TEU and in time of 1 to 2 days while resorting to DPE.


    At JN Port the dwell time of import containers has reduced from 58.08 hrs. in 2016-17 to 50.82 hrs. in 2017-18. The dwell time of export containers has reduced from 88.35 hrs. in 2016-17 to 83.71 hrs. in 2017-18.


    Work order for procurement of 8 mobile container scanner has been issued. Site preparation at ports is in progress. Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) in respect of containerscanners meant to be procured for Paradip, Vishakhapatnam , New Mangalore, Mormugao, Kandla ,Kamrajar and Kolkata Ports have been done. Procurement of Drive through (Roads) scanner (Nos. 4) is under process. Selection of site for Drive through (Rail) scanner is also under process.


    Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust which is the pilot port for implementation of reforms under EoDB has undertaken a no. of initiatives for ensuring convenience to trade & reduction in cargo EXIM Dwell time. To ensure faster cargo evacuation, JNPT has set up a Customs Processing Zones, Centralized Parking Plaza, besides undertaking widening of Port Highways. It has also developed a Common Rail Yard. JNPT has procured electronic RTGCs for increasing yard productivity, besides making ground breaking initiatives for increasing Direct Port Delivery & Direct Port Entry to facilitate trade. All these reforms are regularly communicated to the stakeholders through website update, social media & regular stakeholder meetings.
