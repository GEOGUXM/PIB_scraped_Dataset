    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, received His Excellency Mr Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, the President of the Republic of Maldives , at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (December 17, 2018). He also hosted a banquet in his honour.


    Welcoming the Maldives President to India , the President said that we are honoured that he has chosen to visit India on his first State Visit and that too, within a month of assuming office. This speaks for our close ties and special friendship. The President said that India attaches the highest importance to its relationship with Maldives. Maldives can always count on India as a steadfast partner in its progress as a nation.


    The President said that along with strengthening our bilateral relations, we must also enhance our partnership on global issues. Climate Change needs urgent attention and action. We are deeply concerned of its impact, and especially so on Maldives and other Small Island States that are most vulnerable to it. India has taken the lead to fight Climate Change through the International Solar Alliance. The President invited Maldives to become a member of the Alliance and strengthen its efforts.


    Subsequently, in his banquet speech, President Kovind said that India wishes to see a democratic, stable, prosperous and peaceful Maldives. As the Maldives Government embarks on its journey to fulfill the mandate given by the people of the country, India assures all possible support as a true friend.
