    The methodology used by the Commitee on Real SectorStatistics is different from that used by CSO in its releases and thus the Growth Rates are not comparable.


    The Government of India vide its Press Release dated 28-11-2018 has released the official estimates of Back-Series for the years 2004-05 to 2010-11 with the revised base year 2011-12.


    The Back-Series estimates are required for comparability of earlier data series (2004-05 base) based on changed methodology, data sources and coverage used in the revisedbase year 2011-12.


    This information was given by the Union Minister for Ministry of Statistics and ProgrammeImplementation, Shri D V Sadanand Gowda in Lok Sabha, today.
