    Environmental Clearance has been obtained on 27.03.2018. India based Neutrino Observatory (INO) has applied for Wildlife Clearance to the Govt. of Tamil Nadu in early 2018, as also building clearances for the Inter Institutional Centre for High Energy Physics (ICHEP), Madurai and INO, Pottipuram sites. Clearance from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (PCB) has to be applied after obtaining above clearances.


    The Madurai bench of the Hon’ble Madras High Court had in its order of March 2015 said that no scientific work can start at the underground site before getting clearance from the Tamil Nadu PCB. On the other hand the Environmental Clearance obtained from Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC) in March 2018 was challenged in the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and has been upheld.


    There have been some complaints regarding access to a temple and grazing for cattle from the residents of nearby villages. INO authorities have taken up outreach programme in the matter.


    This was stated by the Minister of State in Ministry of Personnel, PG & Pension and in the Prime Minister’s Office, Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.
