    The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has been implementing various schemes in the country, including in Madhya Pradesh, to promote solarenergy.


    The names of the schemes are as under:


    i. Development of Solar Parks and Ultra Mega Solar PowerProjects.

     1. Scheme for setting up 1000 MW of Grid-Connected Solar PV Power Projects by the Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) and the Government of India organisations with Viability Gap Funding(VGF).
     2. Scheme for setting up 300 MW of Grid-Connected Solar PV Power Projects by Defence Establishments and Para Military Forces withVGF.
     3. Pilot-cum-demonstration projects for development of grid connected solar PV power plants on canal banks and canal tops.
     4. Bundling Scheme - 15000 MW grid-connected solar PV power plants through NTPC Ltd./NVVN.
     5. VGF Scheme for setting up of 2000 MW of Grid Connected Solar PV Power Projects through Solar Energy Corporation of India(SECI).

    vii. VGF Scheme for setting up of 5000 MW of Grid Connected Solar PV Power Projects throughSECI.


    viii. Installation of Grid Connected Solar Rooftop PowerPlants.


    ix. Off-Grid Solar PVScheme.


    The details of quantum of funds provided to Madhya Pradesh under various schemes during the last two years are given in Annexure-I .


    The details of provision of subsidy for consumption of solar energy are given in Annexure-II .

3.   Scheme for Setting up of 750 MW Grid-connected Solar PV Power Projects under Batch-1 of Phase-II of JNNSM with Viability Gap Funding Support           The selection of the bidders has been based on the Viability Gap Funding (VGF) required for the project in an ascending order up to the full capacity. Viability Gap Funding (VGF) is limited to 30% of the project cost or 2.5 crore per MW, whichever is lower. Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) has signed PPA with such project developers for purchasing entire power from the project for 25 years at 5.45 Rs. per unit (4.75 Rs. per unit for projects availing accelerated
