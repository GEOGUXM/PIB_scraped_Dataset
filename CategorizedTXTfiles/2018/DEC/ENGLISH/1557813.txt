    On this day Netaji had visited this place. I urge all of you to take out your mobile phones and commemorating him, switch on the flash lights of your phones in order to pay tribute to him. Say along with me -


    Netaji Zindabad!

    Vande Mataram!


    Thank you so much!


    All the dignitaries present on stage, the family members of Subhas Babu who have specially come here today and my dear brothers and sisters who have gathered here in large numbers.


    I salute this land that had been purified by the sacrifice and heroism of innumerable patriots who had put their lives at stake for freedom. The Andaman and Nicobar group of islands are not only a symbol of natural beauty but also like a pilgrimage centre for the Indians. The greatness of this land remains in the golden history that illuminates not only its geography but also its past. This group of islands is a symbol of our struggle for freedom and of the heroism and resolutions of each and every Indian.


    Friends,


    Our government is committed to empower this group of islands that is significant in terms of the country's past, present and the future and to ensure that it becomes an important part of the country's development story. In order to put this idea on ground, today, projects worth thousands of crores of rupees are being launched or foundation stones laid to connect every corner of Andaman with the facilities. These projects are associated with education, health, connectivity, tourism and Industrial employment. I congratulate all my dear brothers and sisters for the various development projects.


    Friends,


    I got the opportunity to visit two important monuments associated with the country's freedom. Firstly, I visited the Cellular jail and then went to the place where 75 years ago Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had unfurled the flag while declaring the country's independence.


    Friends,


    A completely different feeling fills the mind while entering the campus of the Cellular jail. I really don't know what those people were made up of as they happily suffered all the atrocities. While walking inside the campus of the Cellular jail, one feels that the valiant sons of Mother India are writing 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' with their blood and sweat on the waves of the sea; burning themselves and their lives every moment so that the rays of freedom are emanated.


    Each and every event associated with the life of Veer Savarkar that we have read and heard comes to life in front of our eyes. Those cells where thousands of revolutionaries like Savarkar, Baba Bhan Singh, Mahavir Singh, Indradhanush Ray had to spend so many years and were tortured, are no less than temples for all of us. Several heroes of freedom like Barindra Kumar Ghosh, Ullaskar Dutt, Prithvi Singh Azad, Trilokya Nath Chakraborty and Bhai Parmanand have glorified every corner of the Cellular jail. The grateful nation can never forget these anonymous heroes of freedom.


    Say along with me -


    Let the Martyrs be immortal!


    Let the Martyrs be immortal!


    Friends,


    When it comes to the heroes of freedom, the name of Subhas Chandra Bose fills us with pride and a new zeal. The first Prime Minister of the Azad Hind government had made this land of Andaman, the land of Indian freedom. On Netaji's call, several heroes of Andaman had dedicated their lives for the country's freedom after which the Azad Hind Fauj had unfurled the flag of independence here.


    Today 75 years have passed since that historic event of 30 December 1943. In the memory of that event, we are hoisting a 150 feet high flag to etch this event in memory of our citizens for eternity. Fortunately, I had also got a similar opportunity just a few months back in the Red Fort. At that time, the Azad Hind Fauj had completed 75 years.


    Brothers and sisters,


    A coin and postal stamp have also been released in the memory of this proud moment of history. Moreover, an important decision has been taken by the government so as to ensure that the memory of the freedom fighters including Netaji remains indelible in every corner of Andaman and the entire nation keeps seeking inspiration. Today, while I am talking to you, a notification is being issued. I am about to make that announcement before you with a great pride! From now onwards, the Ross Island will be known as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Island, the Neil Island will be known as Shaheed Island and the Havelock Island will be known as Swaraj Island.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Netaji himself had declared India free from the British rule by waving the Indian flag on the land of this group of islands. On this day, he had addressed a large public gathering of Indians in this very ground, which has now become Netaji Stadium. Then he had said that by occupying this area, the interim government had become a reality. After four years of that utterance, Mother India was freed from the bondage of slavery.


    Friends,


    If doubts and questions were ever raised regarding India's unity during the long period of colonial rule, that was a question of mindset not values. Subhas Babu too believed that we all were one since the ancient times. One cannot deny the fact that there had been attempts to break this unity during colonial rule. Netaji had a firm belief that by emphasizing upon our identity as one nation, that mentality could also be changed. Today I am glad that while walking on the path of 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat', we are all trying to move forward in line with the sentiments of Netaji.


    Friends,


    Often, a few people, knowingly or unknowingly talk about mainland and island during discussions. This has become a part of our vocabulary.


    My dear brothers and sisters,


    For me, the entire India, every corner and part of it is Mainland. Port Blair is equally a Mainland as much as Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai are. This is the reason why our government is focusing on connectivity in those areas which were left behind for whichever reason. Our determination to strengthen the country's physical and emotional integration remains firm.


    Brothers and sisters,


    The feeling of integration strengthens when we commemorate our heroes from the past. Time and again I say that the nation that fails to recognize its real heroes, its history and honour, can never progress. The country that preserves its history and heritage has a strong development trajectory.


    The Central Government has been trying to revive every small part of its magnificent history for the last four and a half years. It is also trying to place it before the countrymen as a source of inspiration because history is not only a phenomenon but also a jewel. History is the day gone by as well as a realization of tomorrow. History not only enshrines courage, might and pain but is also an inspiration for the courage and might. History is the test of our efforts as well as a reflection of our hard work. History forewarns us and teaches us to stay alert.


    History is tied in time and also the energy for a new resolution. History gives us the courage to have new hopes, new dreams and also gives us the courage to dedicate ourselves to the future.


    Friends,


    With this idea, the government has fulfilled the dream of the Police Memorial that was in limbo for several years. The government has constructed the Panchteerth of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar. Our government has built the tallest statue of the world i.e. the Statue of Unity to pay tribute to the pioneer of national unity and peasant movements Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. The country is proud of it today. The various monuments are meant not only for preserving the history but also to pay tribute to the valiant sons who united the country.


    Moreover, we have declared National honours and awards named after Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Sardar Patel. Today I am also announcing to open Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose deemed University.


    Brothers and sisters,


    The main element in the building of a New India inspired from the various national leaders is development. We are trying to ensure that both our resources and culture develop simultaneously; every corner and every person of the country develops with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'. When it comes to the development of the resources, industrial development is an important dimension of it.


    The government is committed to industrial development that is conducive for the conditions and environment of this region. All the efforts such as the use of solar power, LNG, electric cars, the traffic system of this place, are for creating a balance between development and environment.


    Friends,


    The government has come up with a major scheme for industrial development in this area and I am going to announce it amidst you all today in this historic moment. It is called the Lakshadweep and Andaman and Nicobar Island Industrial Development Scheme. Under this, the government will provide financial assistance and concessions to the entrepreneurs who set up eco-friendly industries. With the help of this scheme, several industries will come up here in the future that will provide employment opportunities to the youth here.


    This scheme will benefit thousands of enterprises associated with tourism, food processing and Information Technology. A policy book for startups has been released here today. With all these efforts, the young friends here are sure to benefit. Attempts are being made to develop tourism by preserving its identity and culture of this area. Today several projects related to tourism infrastructure have been launched and their foundation stones laid. Possibilities in the field of high-end tourism will increase with the Passenger Terminal to be constructed in Havelock port or with the expansion of Yard Marina. We are working on a scheme to extend it up to 100 yards instead of 20 yards.


    Friends,


    Industries and tourism develop only when connectivity is good. This year four ships have been included in the transport sector of this place in order to strengthen its connectivity. Besides, under the Make in India programme, 4 ships are being rapidly built in Kochi Shipyard. We are striving to make this group of islands more and more self-reliant. Large vessels are maintained in other parts of the country today. Now, Port Blair's Dock Yard too is being expanded.


    Friends,


    I was told that it used to take a lot of time to travel from Chatham to Bombooflat. Now approval has been given for constructing a bridge between the two places. In the meeting that was held today with the local representatives, the issue of roads was also raised. I was told that there was a problem of repair and maintenance of roads in rural areas here. I urge the Lieutenant Governor to assess and review the condition of the roads. The report should be sent to the Central Government within two weeks. And after the study of the report, the Central Government will provide all possible help.


    Besides, to boost air connectivity, a new integrated terminal building is being built at Veer Savarkar International Airport. This building will be completed very soon. Chartered flights from Port Blair to Chennai and Kolkata will be made available to you all on subsidized rate.


    Friends,


    Along with the waterways, airways and roadways, I-ways too are extremely important. Phone and internet connectivity are also being improved. The under-sea Optical Fibre coming from Chennai, will provide a good quality internet connection to Port Blair as is available in cities of Delhi and Chennai.


    Moreover, the SWAN i.e. the State Wide Area Network too has been started today. Under this, in the first phase, 12 locations of the major islands, the habitable areas will be connected. This will provide high speed internet to the government offices at district and block levels that will facilitate online delivery of government services. In a way, it will boost Digital India in the various islands along with Andaman and Nicobar.


    Friends,


    19 Fish landing centres are being set up so that the youngsters get employment in their traditional occupation as well along with the jobs in new enterprises and tourism sector. Nine have already been completed and the work on the rest of the 10 is progressing at a rapid pace. In addition, financial assistance of Rs.200 crores is being provided to boost agriculture, pisciculture and animal husbandry.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Today crucial projects have been launched and their foundation stones have been laid to fulfil the needs of electricity and water supply. The height of the Dhanikari dam is being increased so that Port Blair and nearby areas do not face water problems for at least the next 20 years.


    When it comes to electricity, solar power plants of 7 MW have been approved in the last 6 months. Besides, the LNG power plant, the foundation stone of which has been laid today, will help in meeting the needs of electricity for the next 25 years.


    Port Blair is playing an important role in the direction of the waste to energy programme. The new Plasma Gas Plant that will be set up here will provide you with clean drinking water as well as clean energy and green fuel.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Your resolution in terms of cleanliness is also commendable! I congratulate the people for the same. I am really glad that the people of this island have declared the island group as Open Defecation Free. Cleanliness is not only enhancing its beauty but also improving the health of the people.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Our government is prioritizing the health of the people of our country. You too are benefitting from it. Two years ago, the Andaman and Nicobar Island Institute of Medical Sciences started in Port Blair. More than 2500 poor and retired people have got their treatment done under the government's Andaman and Nicobar Island Scheme of Health Insurance. Similarly, several poor families here are getting the benefits of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana. Free treatment of up to Rs.5 lakhs for serious ailments in the most advanced hospitals of the country is now possible here as well.


    Friends,


    With the expansion of health services here, the two PHCs and CHCs are being upgraded to district hospital. Besides, the foundation stone of an AYUSH hospital has also been laid today. After these facilities are well in place here, you will not be required to travel to far-off places to get treatment.


    Brothers and sisters,


    The government is also focusing on education besides healthcare. Four years back, a new degree college was opened here and in 2016, a new Law college had also been started. Now you also have the facility of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Deemed University. Polytechnic College has also been started in Diglipur and just a short while ago, I have dedicated an ITI in Nicobar to you all.


    Brothers and sisters,


    The government has been making honest efforts relentlessly to ensure the 5 streams of development throughout the country - education for children, income for the youth, medicines for the elderly, irrigation for the farmers and addressing the people's grievances. All the schemes that have been launched and their foundation stones laid today are associated with the same idea.


    Moreover, we are also committed to ensure that our glorious history, culture and our heroes receive the honour for their valour and sacrifices.


    Once again, I congratulate all my dear brothers and sisters for this historic occasion and for the projects that aim at making your lives better.


    Tomorrow is the last day of the year 2018. Day after tomorrow will be the first day of the New Year 2019. I wish that may the New Year bring new enthusiasm, zeal and energy as well as best health to the people of Andaman and Nicobar, Lakshadweep islands and the whole country. I would like to urge you all once again - to take out your mobile phones, turn on the flash lights and say aloud with me â€¦.


    The place where Subhas Babu had laid the foundation stone of Swaraj, we are pledging to start a strong journey with the resolution of 'Suraaj' on this occasion of 75th anniversary. Turn on the flash lights of your mobile phones and say along with me with all your strength-


    Vande Mataram!


    Vande Mataram!


    Vande Mataram!


    Thanks a lot.
