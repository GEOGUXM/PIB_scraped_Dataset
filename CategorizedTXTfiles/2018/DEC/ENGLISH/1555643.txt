    The Central Government administers a Scheme titled “Central Scheme for Assistance to Civilian Victims of Terrorists/Communal/ Left Wing Extremism Violence and Cross Border Firing and Mine/IED Blasts on Indian Territory”. According to the said Scheme, the State Government concerned initially gives financial relief to the civilian victim/next of kin of victim, which is Rs 5 lakh in case of death/permanent incapacitation (50% and above) and then seeks reimbursement of the expenditure from the Government of India. Apart from it, the concerned State Governments also provide assistance to the victims as per their policy.


    The ex-gratia/compensation is paid to the families of security personnel as per the extant guidelines of CAPFs/Army/State Governments and under the ‘Security Related Expenditure (SRE) Scheme’ for the State Police/Security Personnel/civilian victims.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question in the Rajya Sabha today.
