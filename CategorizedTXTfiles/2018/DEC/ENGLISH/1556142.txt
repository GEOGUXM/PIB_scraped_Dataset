      Posted On: 17 DEC 2018 11:37AM by PIB Delhi

      * RED warning issued for Andhra Pradesh & Yanam (Puducherry) Coasts
      * Landfall today afternoon around Kakinada

    The Severe Cyclonic Storm ‘ PHETHAI ’ over westcentral Bay of Bengal moved further northwards with a speed of 24 kmph during past 06 hours, weakened into a cyclonic storm and lay centred at 0830 hrs IST of 17 th December, 2018 over westcentral Bay of Bengal near latitude 15.8°N and longitude 82.2°E, 370 km north-northeast of Chennai (Tamil Nadu), 120 km east-southeast of Machilipatnam (Andhra Pradesh) and 130 km south of Kakinada (Andhra Pradesh). It is very likely to move nearly northwards and cross Andhra Pradesh coast around Kakinada during 17 th December afternoon. However, due to unfavourable environmental conditions, it is likely to slightly weaken further before landfall and cross coast as a cyclonic storm with a wind speed of 70-90 kmph gusting to 100 kmph.


    Cyclone ‘ PHETHAI ’ is also being tracked by DWR Chennai, Machilipatnam and Vishakhapatnam apart from Satellite and other observations. Forecast track and intensity are given in the following table:
