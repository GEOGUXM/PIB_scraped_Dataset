      Posted On: 19 DEC 2018 3:44PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government has no proposal under consideration to promote the Government officials based on public rating/feedback.


    Department of Pension & Pensioners’ Welfare has informed that an “Aadhar-based Digital Life Certificate (DLC)” for pensioners was launched on 10 th November, 2014.


    Aadhaar is used for authentication of pensioners. As a result of this facility the pensioner is not required to present himself before his pension disbursing agency or produce other documents that he is alive.


    After generation of the DLC, the pension disbursing agencies integrated with the system will get access to the submitted DLC for processing and release of pension there after.


    Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has informed that it has a well-designed, multi-layered robust security system in place to maintain the highest level of data security and integrity in accordance with the Aadhaar Act, 2016 and the Regulations notified under the Act. Some of the security measures include provision of secure channel, implementation of Aadhaar Data Vault, Hardware Security Module, Registered Devices, Virtual ID-UID Token, biometric locking etc.


    This was stated by the Minister of State in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions and Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
