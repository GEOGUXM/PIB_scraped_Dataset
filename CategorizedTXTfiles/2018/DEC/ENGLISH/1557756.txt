    Indian Railways achieved all- round progress during the year with firm focus on safety and passenger services by leveraging the latest in technology and marshalling the inherent strength of a highly dedicated workforce. Some of the significant achievements of the year are highlighted below:


    Enhanced Safety


    Safety continues to be the foremost priority of Railways and is accorded the greatest consideration. During the current year, MoR launched following four safety drives on all Zonal Railways with a view to preventing accidents and strengthening safety on Indian Railways:-

      * On 13.04.2018, all zonal railways were advised to launch a one month safety drive particularly focusing on strict observance of shunting practices with compliance of rules/instructions contained in G&SR etc.
      * On 08.05.2018 all zonal railways were advised to launch a 30 days safety drive specially targeting safety at manned/unmanned level crossings.
      * On 19.06.2018 all zonal railways were asked to launch a safety drive to prevent accident due to cyclonic storm, heavy rains, landslides etc. during monsoon season.
      * On 16.10.2018, zonal Railways were advised to launch a special safety drive for a period of fifteen days with special emphasis on safety of work sites, stacking and handling of railway material near track and maintenance of points & crossings.

    Some of the significant steps taken to enhance safety are:

      * Induction of technology for safety improvements – Smart Coach

    Smart coach with diagnostic system monitor bearing vibrations provides advance information on health of bearing wheel & track. In addition, coach has been provided with wheel slip protection monitoring. Further improvements are being brought about to provide fire safety through fire and smoke detection unit integrated with passenger announcement and information system for emergency evacuation and video analytics with phased detection and unusual occurrence features to further enhance safety and security.


      * On-line Monitoring of Rolling Stock (OMRS)


    Implementation of OMRS is the first step towards predictive maintenance for its Rolling Stock. OMRS monitors the health of each rolling stock and identifies the defective bearings and wheels. Real time alarm is generated to take corrective action before the line failure of the rolling stock. OMRS equipment will also trend the condition of bearing when implemented in whole rail network of IR.


      * Complete switchover to LHB : Indian Railways have decided to completely switch over to manufacture of LHB design main line coaches from 2018-19 onwards. The production of LHB coaches in Production Units has continuously increased over the years Production of LHB coaches from 2004-05 to 2013-14 was 2327 coaches, whereas 5548 coaches were produced from 2014-15 to 2017-18. During 2018-19, it is proposed to manufacture 4016 coaches.


    As a result of relentless efforts put in by Railways, consequential train accidents decreased from 104 to 73 during 2017-18 in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous year. In the year 2018-19 (from 1st April, 2018 to 30 th November, 2018) consequential train accidents decreased further from 51 to 44 in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous year. Category-wise break-up of accidents is given in the following table:-

      * Web base system for track crossing permission - A web based system for granting permission of track crossing related to various public utilities i.e. water/sewerage/gas pipeline, OFC Cable etc. has been developed and made operational on Indian Railways since 01.04.2015. This system provides submission of online application and knowing status of the same till permission is granted. This avoids the frequent visits of the user to the Railway Offices for knowing the status of application.
      * To expedite clearance of track crossing cases, power to accord sanction is delegated to DRM for all the cases.
      * Land Data Management - A web based application called Land Management Module integrated with Track Management System (TMS) of Indian Railways has been developed, for maintaining centralized land data i.e. details of acquisition/area/usages and land plans of Land Bank of Indian Railways in digitized form. Indian Railways has already completed most of the work related to digitization of land record.
      * Indian Railways have also digitized details of vacant land plots measuring more than one acre .

      * Open Access

      * IR is presently drawing about 1100 MW through Open Access, in 10 States of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Haryana, Karnataka, Delhi, U.P. and also in Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC).
      * Railway have saved Rs. 1249 Cr. from April’18 to Sept’18.
      * Indian Railways is doing much better than what was targeted in Mission 41K and till Sept’ 18, it saved about Rs 8902 Cr. T his is more than 16% the proportionate target of Rs 7653 Cr , as envisaged in “Mission 41K.”

      * Automatic Switched Neutral Section (ASNS)

      * Successful trials of ASNS have been carried out in the month of Oct’18(under the supervision of RDSO).
      * This is going to be very important as Indian Railways have decided to run trains at 160 kmph.
      * This will help in reduction of stress to Loco Pilots thereby efficient and safe operation of trains.
      * This will also ruled out any damage to OHE due to Loco Pilots entering neutral section with DJ opening.

      * 100% Green Powered station:

      * Indian Railways’ go green and save electricity initiative has proved to be immensely beneficial.
      * Malwal Railway station of Northern Railway under Firozpur Division is the first Green Powered station commissioned in India (Jan’11). It is meeting all its power needs like lighting and fans load from solar power only.
      * Asangaon Railway station of Central Railway under Mumbai Division has been second 100 % Green Powered station powered with windmill & solar panels (March’18).

      * Railways are making extensive efforts in this direction to make more and more 100% green powered stations.

      * Important Milestones for the current year

      * Indian Railways has been consistently trying to improve the illumination levels at various stations. Various policies have been issued from time to time to improve the illumination levels. The last major decision taken in this regard was to switch over to 100% LED on all Railway Stations.
      * As per the direction of Minister of Railways, Indian Railways has switched over to 100% LED lights stations as on 30.03.2018; a day before the targeted date. This has improved the illumination levels considerably. This was done as Phase-I of the project for improvement in illumination, wherein the existing lights were replaced by LED lights on one is to one basis.
      * PAT: Indian Railway is continuing on its path towards achieving higher energy efficiency & shall achieve the targets set for it under Govt. of India’s Perform Achieve & Trade (PAT) cycle-II and in the next cycle and shall strive for maximizing its gains through earning of more & more energy saving certificates (ESCerts).]
      * Railway is also working on plans to install solar panels on vacant Railway Lands along the tracks and other land parcels for generating power to meet its Traction energy requirement. This would be done First time in the World.

    Mission Raftaar


    Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) along with diagonals carry approximately 58% of freight traffic and 52% of coaching traffic with a share of only 16% of the network (~10000km) taken up for initial emphasis. Major impediments to mobility have been identified viz. ~70% of the routes having sectional speed of less than 130kmph. 2736 level crossings, averaging one LC at every 3-4km. 730 locations speed restrictions (Average one SR at every ~15-20km). ~10% (~900) turnouts of speed of less than 30kmph. A road map has been developed to overcome the existing impediments in a systematic manner. All but 28 unmanned LCs removed on IR.A speed policy framework has been developed to address this issue of the mismatch between speed potential of rolling stock and fixed infrastructure. It has been decided to upgrade 10000km of Golden Quadrilaterals and diagonals for 160 kmph speed and remaining routes for 130 kmph speed. Some of the important elements of the policy are :


      * Replacement of loco hauled commuter trains with Mainline Electric Multiple Units (MEMU trains: MEMU trains have a potential for average speed increment of up to 20kmph in comparison to loco driven passenger trains. Busy Ghaziabad- Allahabad – Mughalsarai route has been made free from conventional trains by replacement by MEMU. For replacement of loco hauled commuter trains with MEMU trains on six routes, total 1048 MEMU coaches and 136 DEMU coaches are required. IR has planned to ramp up the production of MEMU rakes to 1232 coaches in next three years (approximately three times existing level) for ensuring full implementation. Total 124 pair passenger services have been replaced by MEMU/DEMU services on Indian Railways. The travel time has been reduced by 5-20 minutes in these services. Delhi- Mumbai, Delhi- Howrah and Mumbai- Chennai will be completed in Yr 2018-19. All routes will be made free from conventional commuter trains by Yr 2021.

      * Right Powering of freight trains: Over the years Horse Power to trailing load ratio has deteriorated due to longer trailing loads. This has adversely affected average speed of freight trains. New policy introduced for right powering arrangement for freight trains with a horse power to trailing load ratio of 1.5-2.0 to bring it at par with international standards. For eight major railways out of the requirement of 663 additional locomotives, 300 locomotives have been provided.
      * Introduction of Twin Pipe Air Brake System on freight trains: Twin piped braking system saves on an average ~90 seconds in every event of braking, which becomes significant over a long distance. All new wagons are being manufactured with twin pipe system. Retrofitment of all 1.7lac wagons has been sanctioned. Approximately 11000 wagons have been retrofitted.
      * Procedural Improvements: Policy circular 6 which governs increasing speed of trains has been rationalized. It will enable faster realization of gains from new technology and various speed raising initiatives.
      * Decision has been taken to stop the manufacture of conventional ICF coaches and replace them with LHB coaches with speed potential of 160kmph. Successful trial of T-18 by ICF has been done and the same is in the process of commissioning.
      * Standardization of coaching rakes enables first-in-first-out/ reduce rescheduling/ avoid out of path running of trains. In the new time table 960 rakes out of 2732 rakes have been standardized.

    Technology for practical uses

      * Quick Watering Facilities: This facility allows quick filling of water in coaches, which is also essential to maintain cleanliness in them. 7 stations (Ajmer, Jaipur, Abu Road, Vijayawada, Villupuram, Erode and Vadodara stations) have been provided with quick watering facilities. Sanction for provision in 47 more stations has been obtained. For another 66 stations, work for out of sanction in Supplementary Demands for Grants 2018-19 at a cost of about Rs 230 cr has been planned and processed at Railway Board level. Instructions have been issued to all Zonal Railways to be in readiness to award the work as soon as sanction is received for above work. Further, Zonal Railways have been also processed sanction for 27 locations at their level.

      * Monitoring of punctuality through Data Loggers : To authentically report train timings, a system of integrating data-loggers with the Control Office Application (COA) software has been started in Jan’08. Train timings are captured in real time at zonal interchange points and important inter divisional exchange points, there are 168 such points over IR.


    Green Initiatives: Care for Environment

      * Assessment and rating of IRs Production Units and major Workshops as Green Industrial Units started with ‘GreenCo’ certification of 2 Workshops and 1 Production unit in 2016-17. 31 more Workshops, 4 more Production Units, 2 Diesel Sheds, one Stores depot and 2 STCs have been ‘GreenCo’ certified since. 22 of these units have been certified in current financial year 2018-19.

      * Eight Railway Stations and two Railway Schools have achieved Green Certification. 6 out of these 8 railway stations achieved Green Certification in 2018-19. Rail Nilayam/ Secunderabad, IRICEN/Pune and Administrative building of ICF/Chennai are also certified as Green buildings. Railway Hospital Ajmer is the first railway hospital to achieve Green rating recently.


      * Head On Generation (HOG) System: EOG system requires diesel fuel besides having other problems related with maintenance & pollution. In Head on Generation (HOG) electric power for the coaches is received from over head lines through two 500 KVA converters fitted in electric locomotive. This helps in eliminating noise and reduction in carbon foot print. Average saving with HOG on an average is around Rs.70000 per trip per train as it varies with duration of journey.


    After development of concept in 2013-14, Production Units have been turning out all LHB coaches as HOG compliant since December, 2016.

    Promoting Tourism

      * Vistadome Coaches & Hill Railways : These coaches are provided with enhanced viewing area including on roof to enable tourists to enjoy panoramic view while travelling. The feature has been well received. Total of four such coaches are in service on scenic sections.

    Preservation of Heritage in Railways


    In 2018, Railways implemented various policy reforms for meaningful preservation of Railway Heritage and promoting steam heritage tourism. These include creation of budget head for funding heritage related activities, unified structure of zonal level heritage committees, special delegation of powers to Divisional Railway Managers for promoting steam tourism, provision of engagement of retired railway officials for heritage preservation etc. As a result of these reforms, this year witnessed inauguration of steam charter services over Kangra Valley Railway (KVR) and Nilgiri Mountain Railway (NMR), special steam hauled round trip services over Kalka Shimla Railway & Nilgiri Mountain Railway, introduction of AC coaches over Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, introduction of weekly steam service between Garhi Hasru – Farukhnagar in Delhi Division, steam tourist specials in South India hauled by EIR-21 (Express) which is one of the World’s oldest working steam locomotives (Year built 1855) etc. All these have immensely helped creating interest in steam heritage tourism in the country. Steps taken include :

      * As a major Digital India initiative in recent years, Ministry of Railways partnered with Google’s nonprofit Arts & Culture initiative to make India’s railways century old heritage accessible worldwide using advanced digital technologies through online storytelling and virtual reality. This is a first of its kind effort of Indian Railways to digitize its heritage and bring it online for universal access.
      * The project, named Lifeline of a Nation (accessible at https://g.co/indianrailways ) was launched by Minister of Railways on 28 th September, 2018. The online platform brings together a collection of digital storytelling with more than 3,000 images, 150 videos and 150 iconic locations of Indian Railways across India. The project offers insights regarding the lesser known stories and heroic efforts of people like track men, station charges and workshop engineers, to celebrate their contribution to India’s Railways.
      * On 15th August, 2018, Railways launched digital museums at selected railway stations in India to spread awareness among public about the rich heritage of railways. The effort aimed at showcasing the more than century old the legacy of Indian Railways via one to two minute-long movie clips on digital LED screens at the entrance gate of railway stations and also at different comfort areas. The short films will showcase heritage buildings, locomotives and much more to make people aware of the rich heritage of Indian Railways. With a target to reach 100 stations, so far these screens are operational at more than 30 stations.
      * As a living example of industrial heritage and to depict technological development over Indian Railways, five meter gauge (MG) and three narrow gauge (NG) lines have been identified for preservations and further developing them as heritage tourism destinations.
      * In December, 2018, Railways notified the Indian Railways Heritage Charter (IRHC) -2018, for the first time in its history, outlining its commitment and providing broad guidelines for restoration, preservation and conservation of century old rich railway heritage of India.

      * Revival of steam locomotives: To preserve the rich heritage of Indian Railways, vigorous efforts of revival of steam locomotives, since 2017 has been taken. This has resulted in to revival of EIR 21, the oldest steam locomotive in the world by Golden Rock Workshop of Southern Railway, Beyer Garratt by Kharagpur Workshop of South Eastern Railway, ZB 66 in Kangra Valley section and Miss Muffet by Jamalpur Workshop of Eastern Railway.


    Customer Focused Policies for Freight


    To make the rail transportation attractive to its customers, various initiatives were taken in 2017-18 which includes tariff rationalisation, classification of new commodities, expansion of freight basket through containerisation, new delivery models like RORO services, Long Term Tariff Contract policy with key customer, Station to Station rate, Double Stack Dwarf Container (DSDC), Customer friendly rationalization of weighment Policy,Electronic Registration for Demand of Wagons (e-RD) etc.


    These policies launched in 2017-18 have been further extended upto March 2019.


    The main initiatives undertaken during 2018-19 are:-

      * Electronic Transmission of Railway Receipts (eT-RR)

    With introduction of E-RD (Electronic Registration for Demand of wagon), eT-RR has been implemented which use a user-friendly and paperless transaction system where Railway Receipt is generated and transmitted electronically to customer through FOIS and delivery of goods is given through e-surrender of eT-RR. That is, customer is saved the hassle of carrying physical Railway Receipt from originating to destination station. After success of pilot project at one terminal namely HPCL/Loni of Central Railway, it has been implemented over Northern Railway in second phase in March 2018. Proliferation on pan India basis is on anvil.

      * Customer friendly rationalization of weighment Policy
      * Zonal railways have been empowered to permit weightometer / pre-weighbin system of weighment in private siding on case- to- case basis w.e.f. 18.06.2018.
      * Dispensation from mandatory (100%) weighment in the case of container rake loaded with containers carrying standard bags of uniform size.

    · Exemption from weighment has been granted in case of loading of standard Bags of uniform size in container. Low density commodities like Pet Coke, Met Coke, Chuni and De-oiled cake have been exempted from mandatory weighment.

      * Designed tare weight of new wagons namely BOXNS, BCFC, BRHNEHS, BOBRNHS, BOBRNEL, BOBYNHS, BFNSM 22.9 has been notified

      * Issue of multiple Railway Receipts (RRs) for container traffic

      * Indian Railways had extended facility of multiple RRs in favour of more than one Container Train Operator for a single container train (w.e.f.20.04.2017). The guidelines have been implemented recently in September 2018. This facility has come in on an opportune time as M/o Shipping has now relaxed ‘Cabotage’ law for foreign vessels on transportation of loaded for empty containers between Indian ports. With this relaxation, aggregation of containers at ports is likely to get a fillip. The facility of multiple RRs(Railway Receipts) for each operator shall further aid aggregation and promote economic growth. In addition, it is in sync with GST requirements and shall help each operator to avail Input Tax Credit(ITC) as per freight paid.
      * Promoting containerization

    To promote containerisation, following measures have been taken: –

      * Introduction of new delivery model of Double Stack Dwarf Container to be charged by applying 17% concession on FAK rate has been extended upto 31.03.2019.
      * The methodology for levying Terminal Access Charge (TAC) for handling container train in railway terminal has been liberalised from 1.5 times to one time in case of double operation (i.e. unloading followed by loading), reduces non-freight cost to customer.
      * With effect from 11.07.2018, movement of CP Coke, a restricted commodity, has now been permitted in transportation in container at CCR (Container Class Rate) i.e. by applying 15% concession on Applicable class rate published in Goods tariff.
      * Decision has been taken to transport empty containers and empty flat wagon for private container rakes at a discount of 25%. The move is likely to give a thrust to movement of empty container by rail towards ports to return as loaded, thus profiting Indian Railway with higher container share.

      * Liberalised Automatic Freight Rebate Scheme in Empty flow Directions


    This scheme has been issued w.e.f.01.01.2017. Under this scheme loaded traffic in empty flow direction is being charged at LR1 (with certain conditions), which amounts to average discount of 30 – 40%. In the revised policy, benefit has been extended to the traffic booked from originating Division to intermediate point on that O-D division. Further, rebate has also been extended to the traffic booked from originating division to all the other divisions (not listed in the empty flow direction) of the destination zone. This will help to decrease empty flow movement of rakes. This scheme has further reviewed and revised guidelines have been issued w.e.f. 01.10.2018. This will help to decrease empty flow movement of rakes.


      * Freight Heavy Haul Initiatives:

      * P rototype of the 25T axle load BOXNS wagons was made in Oct’15. The wagon will run at 100 kmph in loaded and empty condition with pay load to tare ratio of 4.1 as compared to conventional BOXNHL wagons, which have payload to tare ratio of about 3.6. These wagons will achieve increased throughput per rake by 14.8%. 25t wagons are required for operation on DFC, which were tried upto 110/100 kmph on SER successfully. Induction of these wagons has already started, till Nov. 2018, 2600 wagons are in operation and another 2400 are in the pipe line.
      * For increasing throughput of finished goods and other containable goods, a dwarf container has been designed which can be moved in double stack loading even under electrified sections of IR. This enables increase in throughput of containable commodity even on electrified lines. This service has been opened on Jamnagar-Ludhiana route and efforts are on to proliferate on other routes also.
      * In the area of multimodal transport, the concept of Road-Railers which was under trial for past few year has been finalized in 2016-17. The commercial operation of the train has started in August, 2018. This allows for specially designed road trailers to bring container load form the customer premises to Railway sidings where it gets converted to train and goes to the destination. This initiative brings door to door delivery for container traffic without need for any container handling at railway premises.
      * In the area of transportation of finished steel namely hot rolled and cold rolled steel coils, new wagon BFNSM has been designed which is specifically designed for increasing the throughput of steel coil by more than 35% per rake compared to other similar wagons. Safety approvals for this have been obtained and induction of these wagons has started in 2018 already.

    Transformation of Indian Railways

      * Large scale process and cultural reforms are being introduced in order to steadily transform Indian Railways into a more vibrant and efficient organization and make it an engine of economic growth and development of the country. Empowerment of General Managers (GMs), Divisional Railway Managers (DRMs) and frontline staff and comprehensive delegation of powers have been done so as to fast track decision making, Deliverance and overall working of Railways. Model Schedule of Powers has also been issued from Railway Board in October 2017 (revised version in July 2018) for the first time to bring uniformity in delegations across zones.
      * The enhanced delegations and empowerment will improve safety, give faster access to work and breakdown sites, improve station and passenger interfaces, ease of procurement by user departments, improve upkeep of equipment, improve cleanliness and hygiene at stations and in trains and enhance training and capacity building of staff.
      * Stress on integrity and ethics - Prime thrust of Indian Railways is on transparency in its functioning and on impeccable integrity of its employees at all levels. In this aspect, a policy of zero tolerance against corruption is being followed. Mission Satya Nishtha has been launched on 27 July 2018 across IR to inculcate the culture of honesty and transparency.
      * Workshop on Leadership and Emotional Intelligence for GMs and DRMs has been organized at NAIR to further align the top management of the Railways with the Transformation initiatives (Workshop for GMs held on 10 & 11 Nov’ 2018, for DRMs on 17 & 18 Dec 2018 and 8 & 9 Dec 2018). This is being further proliferated to the level of Principal Heads of Departments.

    Personnel & Educational Initiatives

      * Two recruitment drives were launched by the Railways in the first half of the year:-
      * For 27,795 ALPs and 36,576 Technicians (Total – 64,371).
      * For 62,907 vacancies in Level I including Trackmen.
      * The first stage examination involving 47.56 lakh candidates have been successfully completed on 04.09.2018 with record attendance percentage of 77%.
      * For Level I, a total of 1.90 crores have been called for examination which commenced on 17 th September, 2018 and ended successfully on 17 th December, 2018. Total attendance in this examination was about 61%. It is a paperless and computer based test.
      * Thus in a short time of less than nine (9) months, the Railway has not only called for the applications, but shortlisted them and organized the recruitment examinations too. It is the biggest computer based test involving about 2.40 crore candidates.
      * To address the problem of inaccuracies and deficiencies in the assessment of vacancies on Indian Railways and their linkages to RRBs, Online Indenting and Recruitment Management System (OIRMS) has been implemented in recruitment processes against latest Centralized Employment Notifications (CENs) No.01/2018 for the posts of ALP & Technicians and 02/2018 for vacancy assessment by Railways/PSUs, and online indenting of the same have been carried out with the help of OIRMS software.

      * India’s first Rail and Transportation University


    National Rail and Transportation Institute (NRTI), Vadodara has begun its first academic session with two under-graduate programmes from 05 th September, 2018. A total of 103 students (17 girls and 86 boys) have joined the two courses (62 in B.Sc. and 41 in BBA). The Courses are:-

      * B.Sc. in Transportation Technology
      * BBA Programme in Transportation Management
      * The NRTI was dedicated to the nation on 15 th December, 2018.

      * E mployees grievance redressal and health check up camps across Indian Railways

      * In September 2017 Zonal Railways and Production Units organized grievance redressal camps at various field locations for redressal of employees grievances. This was combined with health checkup of employees. In the above camp the service records of the employees were shown to the employees and copies also supplied to them.
      * 9025 health camps were held throughout the country for employees during last 12 months. 12 lakh employees were covered in this drive.

      * Training under ‘Project Saksham’

      * A massive training programme named as ‘Project Saksham’ has been launched this year for giving 5 days on the job training to all 12 lakhs employees of Indian Railways. This will help in competence building of employees and thereby productivity and efficiency of the organization. We have by now trained more than 12 lakhs employees which is a record in itself.

      * Introduction of objective type question in Departmental promotion examination in Railways.

      * In order to bring objectivity in the selection procedure in departmental selections, Ministry of Railways has introduced a system of 100% objective question for departmental selection in non-gazetted categories by way of either computer based test or by OMR sheets. The benefits of objective type question paper are – greater coverage of subject questions, transparency in selection, quick declaration of result and avoidance of complaint from candidates. A question bank on each of the subject will be prepared, to be updated from time to time.

      * Introduction of Mobile application on staff matter.

      * Various Zonal Railways have launched Mobile applications to cater to service request for Railway employees. This will improve the grievance redressal mechanism and help in better productivity of staff as satisfaction level of staff will improve.

      * Scanning of service records of all employees.

      * Ministry of Railways has had scan more than 12 lakh service records of its employees. This will improve access of service records to employees. Our further aim is to use the scanned records for development and launch of HRMS application.

      * Development and updation of data on COMPTRAN

      * A portal named as COMPTRAN (Common Portal for Mutual transfer) for employees desiring mutual transfer to their place of residence has been developed which helps in online search for mutual partners for employees’ inter Zonal transfers. Recently, the Zonal Railways have been asked to update the data on the portal so that it is helpful for employees as regards search for their mutual partner is concerned. This is a welfare scheme for employees of Indian Railways.

      * Aadhar Enabled Bio-metric Attendance System (AEBAS)

      * AEBAS has been implemented on Indian Railways in compliance with DOPT’s instructions contained in their OM No.11013/9/2014-Estt(A-iii) dated 21.11.2014. This will improve monitoring of staff attendance and hence improve productivity.

    Continuing with its winning spree, RSPB has been doing fabulously in 28 game disciplines on national and international sports arena and is a established and one of the most prestigious Sports Bodies in India today. Indian Railways is a proud institutions today having 162 Arjuna awardees, 21 Padmashree and 5 Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna awardees on its roll besides thousands of national and international talented athletes. Indian Railways performance in the field of sports has been unparalleled.


    R ailway S ports P romotion B oard made a number of policy changes in the larger interest of sports and brought out following changes during January-November 2018:


      * To pave the way of becoming officer, RSPB has made provisions more easier to its athletes who are representing India in various international championships.

      * RSPB has introduced 3-4 coaching camps and started fielding its teams atleast 4-5 national level tournaments and has started giving hotel accommodations to its athletes participating in national/international tournaments.
      * As a result, RSPB has been able to get podium performances from its athletes in 40 national championships, best ever performance of RSPB till date. Internationally also, RSPB has come out with 10 gold medals in Commonwealth games and 27 medals in Asian Games besides other various international tournaments.
      * RSPB successfully hosted the World Cycling Championship at Bikaner in North Western Railway recently.

    Research and Development

      * Streamlining of vendor registration process of RDSO: A number of steps have been taken by RDSO towards streamlining new vendor registration process. The process of vendor registration has been made completely online and there has been reduction in average time of fresh registration cases from existing 30 months to 6 months. EOI has been floated by RDSO open for application throughout the year. Hence suppliers based outside Lucknow, now have the provision of online vendor registration application and the whole process of registration is completed within a specific timeline. There was also an emphasis to resolve all the pending vendor registration cases in within reasonable time frame. There were 691 old pending cases initially by October’17 which have been brought down to 98 by December’18.

      * Collaboration with Other Research and Academic Institutions : IR has made a significant move by engaging with IITs (Indian Institute of Technology) to leverage their core competencies in developing new technologies and products. Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)s have been signed in the between Ministry of Railways and these institutes for establishing Centre of Railway Research (CRR)s. The research domains allocated to these CRRs’, based on their competencies, have been listed below:

    Other Notable Initiatives


      * ‘SAMANVAY’ Portal for co-ordination with State Governments : A ‘SAMANVAY’ portal ( www.railsamanvay.co.in ) has been developed for online reporting of issues pending with State Governments pertaining to infrastructural developmental projects which are being undertaken by different Railway agencies. Concerned State Governments were requested to go through the pending issues of Railways in States which are uploaded on SAMANVAY portal and take needful action to help Railway expedite its developmental/expansion projects.

      * Rail Good Work Portal: With a view to generate numerous innovative yet practical ideas across the most critical areas of Railways Operations, the Railway board has undertaken several initiatives from time to time. Rail Good Work Portal is an on-line platform for all units under IR, where they can showcase the various good works being done by them. An exercise has been undertaken to identify the best and the most impactful entries uploaded on the good works portal and ask the innovators for descriptive videos for mass scale implementation across IR and to further encourage the habit of doing good work and reporting thereon.
