    It is true that the Defence expenditure as per percentage of Central Government. Expenditure has fallen, however, the Defence expenditure in absolute terms has been showing a steady increase.


    The projections made by the Services are forwarded to Ministry of Finance for favourable consideration as it is the nodal Ministry for allocation of funds. Based on the overall resource position, funds are allocated by Ministry of Finance. While distributing these allocations among the Services, it is ensured that sufficient funds are available to meet critical requirements.


    Also depending on expenditure during the year and additional requirements projected, funds are sought at Supplementary/ Revised Estimate (RE) stage. The allocated funds are optimally and fully utilized towards operational activities. Further, if required, schemes are reprioritized to ensure that urgent and critical capabilities are acquired without any compromise to operational preparedness.
