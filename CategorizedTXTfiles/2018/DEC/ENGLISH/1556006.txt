The scheme provides an assured return of 8% per annum for 10 years. The differential return i.e. the difference between return generated by LIC and the assured return of 8% per annum is borne by Government of India as subsidy on annual basis .Mode of pension payment is monthly, quarterly, half-yearly and annually based on option exercised by the subscriber. The scheme was open initially for subscription for a period of one year i.e. from 4th May, 2017 to 3rd May, 2018.
