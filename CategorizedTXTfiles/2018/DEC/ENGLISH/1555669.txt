    The targets for nuclear power generation are set on an annual basis, as a part of annual Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), a Public Sector Undertaking under Department of Atomic Energy (DAE).


    However, the Government has planned to increase the installed capacity base of nuclear power in the country for increased electricity production from nuclear power. The present installed nuclear power capacity of 6780 MW would reach 13480 MW by the year 2024-25 with the completion of projects under construction (including 500 MW Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR), being implemented by Bhartiya Nabhikiya Vidhyut Nigam Limited (BHAVINI). The Government has also accorded administrative approval and financial sanction for 12 nuclear power reactors aggregating a total capacity of 9000 MW, which are scheduled to be completed progressively by the year 2031. On their completion, the total nuclear power capacity would reach 22480 MW.


    More reactors, based on both indigenous technologies and with foreign cooperation are planned in the future. With the increase in the nuclear installed capacity base, the electricity generation from nuclear power would also increase.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
