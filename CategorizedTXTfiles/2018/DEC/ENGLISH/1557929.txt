    Conscious of the issues of slums and poverty, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has channelized its efforts in promoting equitable growth in urban areas through Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM). The Mission addresses major social challenges of urbanization & economic growth such as urban poverty, unemployment and social exclusion through five key components: Social Mobilization and Institution Development (SM&ID), Employment through Skills Training & Placement (EST&P), Self-Employment Programme (SEP), Support to Urban Street Vendors (SUSV) and Scheme of Shelter for Urban Homeless (SUH). During the year: -

Also, i t has been decided to develop two Model Shelters for urban homeless in each state , one in the state capital and one in another big city, having sizable population of urban homeless. Also, two ULBs in each state, one in a million plus city and one in another big city are to be developed as Model ULBs for urban street vendors .

    Skill training and placement under the Mission is one of the vital cogs of Skill India Mission. So far, 8,89,844 persons have been trained & certified, and 4,64,178 candidates have been placed wage as well as self-employment. In order to improve skill training programmes based on direct feedback by the candidates through SMS/online mode, a Personalized After Training Rapid Assessment System (PARAS) has been introduced.


    City Livelihoods Centres (CLC) provide an interface between service providers, such as plumbers, electricians, carpenters, tailors, tutors etc., and service seekers i.e. households and local institutions. More than 350 CLCs are functioning, acting as aggregators for local urban services. CLCs also provide marketing support to SHGs to improve sales of their products. To promote self-employment, interest subvention is provided on bank loans over and above 7% ROI. So far Rs 16,160 crores has been sanctioned for 8,36,869 loan accounts.

The survey for identification of street vendors has been completed in 2,322 cities; 16,89,564 street vendors have been identified and 8,18,095 vendors have been given ID cards.


    H omeless persons are a particularly vulnerable section of the urban poor population, often facing extreme living conditions, malnutrition and other health issues, as well as exclusion from society. The SUH component aims to provide shelters equipped with basic amenities to provide dignified living conditions and connect them to available safety nets. The SUH guidelines make it mandatory for local municipal bodies to conduct systematic third-party surveys to assess accurately the need for shelters at locations close to places of natural congregation. 1,776 shelters for urban homeless have been sanctioned so far, to create capacity for 89,000 urban homeless persons, and 1,084 shelters are currently functional.
