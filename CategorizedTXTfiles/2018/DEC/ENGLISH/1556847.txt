      Posted On: 20 DEC 2018 5:42PM by PIB Delhi


    International Centre for Automotive Technology (ICAT) launched the Certification with high security features in order to prevent use of forged certificates in New Delhi this week.


    This is a first of its kind initiative taken by any automotive certification agency in India for enhancing the security of the CMVR certificates which includes Type Approval Certificates (TAC) and Conformity of Production (COP) Certificates for vehicles, engines and components.


    Joint Secretary, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH), Shri Priyank Bharti and CEO,NATRiPImplementation Society, Ms. Neeti Sarkar released a new ICAT certificate format in the presence of senior officials of the Ministry and ICAT.


    The new ICAT certificate format consists of nine new and unique security features incorporated in the certificate. The most important security feature is the paper itself on which the certificate is to be printed as it is a special paper which is made especially according to ICATâ€™s specific requirements. The unique features in the certificate are as listed below:

      * High security paper
      * Printing using the ultraviolet ink
      * Troymark
      * Microprint
      * Pantograph
      * Reverse Pantograph
      * Secure code
      * Print code
      * Digitally printed stamp and seal of ICAT

    While some of the security features are generic in nature same for all the certificates), the other features are specific for each certificate i.e. the contents or the information covered through these features will be specific for that particular certificate. Another distinction is that some of the features are visible only through ultraviolet light. The certificates will be printed using special printers which have been imported by ICAT for this very purpose.


    With the new high security features it will become difficult to forge or counterfeit the ICAT certificate.


    The event was attended by officials of SIAM, ACMA, OEMs viz. Maruti Suzuki, Toyota, Volkswagen, Honda Cars, Mahindra, and Tata component manufacturers viz. Denso.


    ICAT is the premier certification agency authorized by Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) for providing testing and certification services to the vehicle and component manufacturers situated within India and abroad. In addition to the certification services, ICAT is providing extensive testing services for product development and validation.
