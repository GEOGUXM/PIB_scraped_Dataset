    Government has undertaken various interventions to boost the pulse and oilseeds production during last four and a half years to achieve self-sufficiency in the country.

Similarly, the production of oilseeds has increased from 24.88 Million Tonnes to 31.3 Million Tonnes during the same period, registering an increase of 25.80%.


    The Govt. of India has supported the growers’ with record procurement of pulses at MSP. Further, the Govt. of India’s decision to create buffer stock of pulses has also led to the increase of pulses production in the country. The bold step to raise Minimum Support Price to 1.5 times of cost of production undertaken this year will further encourage the farmers to grow more pulses and oilseeds. Notably, the MSP of Moong has increased from Rs. 4500 per quintal in 2013-14 to Rs. 6979 in 2018-19. Similarly for Urad from Rs. 4300 to Rs. 5600 per quintal and for Sunflower from Rs. 3700 to Rs. 5388 per quintal.


    It is notable that during 5 years from 2009-10 to 2013-14, only a quantity of 7.28 lakh MT of pulses and oilseeds valuing Rs. 3117.38 Crore was procured at MSP whereas during the period from 2014-15 to 2018-19, a quantity of 93.97 lakh MT of pulses and oilseeds valuing Rs. 44,142.50 Crore were procured at MSP by Govt. of India. Procurement of 78.84 Lakh MT amounting to Rs 35,800 crore alone has been contributed by the states of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana & Andhra Pradesh. More than 54 lakh farmers benefitted from the procurement of pulses and oilseeds during this period indicating that on an average a farmer was benefitted to the extent of approximately Rs. 80,000 by this MSP procurement. The procurement of pulses and oilseeds has increased by almost 13 times during the year 2014 till date as compared to the procurement done from 2009-2014.


    The recently launched Umbrella Scheme “Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) provides for a holistic arrangement for assurance of a remunerative and stable price environment for growers /farmers to increase agriculture production and productivity. This Umbrella Scheme comprises Price Support Scheme (PSS) for pulses & oilseeds, Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) & Pilot of Private Procurement & Stockist Scheme (PPSS) for oilseeds to ensure MSP to the farmers. The other existing scheme of Department of Food & Public Distribution for procurement of paddy, wheat and coarse grain and of Ministry of Textile for cotton and jute will continue for providing MSP to farmers. The implementation of the schemes will entail joint arrangements by the Central Govt. and State Govt. The PM-AASHA scheme provides for a budgetary support of Rs. 15,053 Cr.


    As against a Govt. Guarantee of Rs. 2,500 Crore upto the year 2013-14, a Govt. Guarantee of Rs 18,250 Cr for the Years 2018-20 has been made available for smooth conduct of PSS operations.
