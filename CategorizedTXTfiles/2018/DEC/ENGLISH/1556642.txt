2016                    1194931   1187111

    There has been about fivefold increase in the number of grievances received in CPGRAMS from 2014 to 2017. The rate of disposal has also kept pace with the number of grievances received during the period. High rate of disposal has been achieved since the Government has taken every possible step to put in place a strong Grievance Redress Mechanism.


    Government has taken several steps to make the Grievance Redressal Mechanism effective for quick disposal of public grievances which are as under:


    (i) Review of Grievances of identified Ministry/Department is undertaken every month during meetings conducted on PRAGATI (Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation) platform .


    (ii) For effective monitoring of grievances at Secretary level, an electronic Dashboard has been created showing the consolidated status of grievances disposed and pending, on CPGRAMS. Weekly reminders through SMS are also being sent for pending grievances.


    (iii) A Grievance Analysis Study in respect of top 20 grievance receiving Ministries/ Departments/ Organizations listed on CPGRAMS for identifying grievance prone areas, their root cause analysis and suggested systemic reforms for reducing such grievances, has been carried out by Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances. Several suggested systemic reforms have been implemented by the concerned Ministries/Departments. Some of these reforms are: automatic refunds on cancellation of Railway Tickets, Single Window Pension through disbursing Banks, intensive mechanized cleaning of coaches, e-verification of Income Tax Returns, expeditious Income Tax Returns upto Rs.50,000/-, etc.


    (iv) In continuation of the Grievance Analysis Study in respect of top 20 Ministries/ Departments receiving maximum grievances on CPGRAMS, another Grievance Analysis Study for next 20 Ministries/ Departments receiving bulk of the grievances has also been carried out by Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances.


    (v) A Public Grievances Call Centre has been set up for reminding the concerned officials of top 40 Ministries/Departments/Organizations for expeditious disposal of grievances pending for more than 2 months.


    (vi) An Award Scheme has been launched for recognising outstanding performance with respect to disposal of grievances on CPGRAMS on a quarterly basis through issue of Certificate of Appreciation.


    (vii) Review meetings are being taken on regular basis with the representatives of Central Ministries/ Departments for monitoring pendency of public grievances.


    (viii) Training on CPGRAMS is conducted on regular basis.


    (ix) A new Mobile App which is more user-friendly for lodging of public grievances has been developed. The Grievance Action Status can also be viewed on the mobile itself. This has been integrated with Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance (UMANG). This initiative also facilitates lodging of grievance anywhere anytime.


    This was stated by the Minister of State in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions and Minister of State in the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
