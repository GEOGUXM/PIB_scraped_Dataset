    Samagra Shiksha - an Integrated Scheme for School Education has been launched throughout the country as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme with effect from the year 2018-19.

It is an overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education. It envisages the ‘school’ as a continuum from pre-school, primary, upper primary, secondary to senior secondary levels.

    Preference for opening of new school is given to tribal areas, and areas with high concentration of Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) and minority population. The districts with high concentration of population of SCs, STs and Muslims have been identified as Special Focus Districts (SFDs) for ensuring equity and inclusion at all levels of school education. Provisions have also been made for 1020 residential schools/hostels for children living in sparsely populated areas, children living in areas where schools cannot be opened due to unavailability of land and children in need of care and protection.

Approval has been given for special training of 8.08 lakh children with the financial outlay of Rs. 56353.95 lakh in 2018-19.
