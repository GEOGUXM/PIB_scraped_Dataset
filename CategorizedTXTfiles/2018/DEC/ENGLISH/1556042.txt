    The Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has been working hard towards facilitating safe passenger movements for Kumbh-Mela 2019
    
    Kumbh-Mela is scheduled to be held at Sangam, Prayagraj (Allahabad) from 15.01.2019 to 15.03.2019. IWAI has set up four floating terminals, one each at, Kilaghat, Sarasvati Ghat, Naini Bridge and Sujawan Ghat.
    
    Further, two vessels namely C.L. Kasturba and S.L.Kamla will be deployed for pilgrim movement.
    
    Fairway with navigational aids will be maintained between Prayagraj (Allahabad) and Varanasi with targeted least available depth (LAD) of 1.0 m. Five temporary jetties at Chatnag, Sirsa, Sitamarhi, Vindhyachal and Chunar have also been setup for embarkment and dis-embarkment of passengers.
    
    IWAI has the mandate to provide safe and efficient mode of transport through Inland navigation.
    
    As a part of development of NW-1 (Allahabad to Haldia) IWAI is making substantial interventions to make navigable the Allahabad -Varanasi stretch of River Ganga. In this regard, IWAI is working on providing a sufficient draft of 1.0 m for the entire channel in river Ganga between Allahabad and Varanasi. This will ensure seamless and safe movement of vessels.
