    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the Centre of Excellence for Sickle Cell Anaemia, Thalassemia and Other Genetic Blood Disorders at the Prathima Institute of Medical Sciences in Karimnagar, Telangana today (December 22, 2018).


    Speaking on the occasion, the President said that our country has made significant strides in the field of healthcare. However, we still have a long way to go in evolving a holistic healthcare system, one which is uniformly affordable and accessible. Strengthening public hospitals, municipal hospitals, charitable hospitals and primary health and wellness clinics must receive priority. This apart, we need to spread awareness on healthcare issues especially in rural areas and among disadvantaged sections.
