    The National Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy 2016 was adopted on 12.5.2016 as a vision document to guide future development of IPRs in the country. This has led to the following achievements:-

     1. Strengthening of Institutional Mechanism

    The administration of Copyright Act, 1957 and Semiconductor Integrated Circuits Layout-Design Act, 2000 has been transferred to Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion.

Under the Finance Act 2017, the Copyright Board has also been merged with the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB).

    Various steps undertaken by the Government, including augmentation of technical manpower, have resulted in drastic reduction in pendency in IP applications.

    A IPR Enforcement Toolkit have been prepared to assist police officials in dealing with IP crimes, in particular, Trademark counterfeiting and Copyright piracy.


    While there is no specific scheme to establish IP Centres in all universities in India, State Governments have been approached to establish IPR Cells in various academic institutions; IPR Cells have been established in 41 universities across different States. In addition, ‘Institution Innovation Councils’ (IICs) have been set up in more than 1000 Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) through the Innovation Cell at AICTE under the Ministry of HRD.


    Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) are private rights which are applied for, and enforced, by the owner of the concerned IP. IP professionals from the relevant fields, including legal field, assist them in this regard. In particular, 2240 Patent agents and 702 Trademark agents have been registered under the relevant provisions of the Patents Act, 1970 and Trade Marks Act, 1999 respectively by the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks. Further, an advocate registered under the Advocates Act can directly work as Trademarks Attorney for filing/processing of trademarks applications.
