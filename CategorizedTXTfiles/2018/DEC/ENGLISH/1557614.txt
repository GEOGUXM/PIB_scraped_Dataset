    The bilateral MoUs/Agreements do not contain any provision on extending financial aid or providing of medical aid.


    The objective of the MoUs / Agreements is to establish comprehensive inter-ministerial and inter-institutional cooperation in the field of health and medicine with the aims and objectives of upgrading the quality and reach of human, material and infrastructural resources involved in healthcare, training and research on the basis of equality, reciprocity and mutual benefit. The collaborations encourage joint initiatives and technology development in the health sector.


    To further elaborate the details of cooperation and to oversee the implemention of the MoUs / Agreements, joint meetings are held at appropriate times as mutually decided upon. It provides opportunities for sharing and emulating best practices and learning from each other, to address public health challenges.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
