     1. National Mission for Clean Ganga(NMCG):

         1. Ganga Rejuvenation:-


      * Under Namami Gange programme, a total of 254 projects worth Rs.24,672 crore have been sanctioned for various activities such as sewage infrastructure, ghats & crematoria development, river front development, river surface cleaning, institutional development, biodiversity conservation, afforestation, rural sanitation, and public participation.


      * 131 projects out of 254 were sanctioned for creation of 3076 MLD new sewage treatment plants (STPs), rehabilitation of 887 MLD of existing STPs and laying/ rehabilitation of 4942 km sewer network for abatement of pollution in river Ganga and Yamuna.


      * In a paradigm shift in sewage sector in the past one year, works on six STP projects (50 MLD in Varanasi, 82 MLD in Haridwar, 30 MLD at Mathura, 50 MLD at Kanpur, Unnao & Shuklaganj, 35 MLD at Farrukhabad and 72 MLD at Allahabad-Jhushi, Naini & Phaphamau) have been started under Hybrid Annuity PPP mode (HAM). Other projects sanctioned under HAM are Mirzapur Gazipur and Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh; Digha, Kankarbagh and Bhagalpur in Bihar; Kolkata, Howrah, Bally, Kamarhati and Baranagar in West Bengal.


      * For River Front Development, works at 145 ghats and 53 crematoria are in progress and expected to be completed by March 2019.


      * For river surface cleaning, 11 trash skimmers have been deployed at Haridwar, Garh Mukhteshwar, Kanpur, Varanasi, Allahabad, Patna, Sahibganj, Nabadwip, Howrah Delhi and Mathura-Vrindavan.


      * On rural sanitation front, all 4465 villages on the bank of river Ganga have been made Open Defecation Free (ODF) and 10,83,688 Individual Household Toilets have been constructed by Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation (MoDWS). NMCG has released Rs. 829.0 crore to MoDWS for this.


      * Total 6 no. of projects on biodiversity conservation and restoration of aquatic biodiversity of river Ganga including Dolphin, Ghariyal, Otter, water birds and fish & fisheries have been taken up, out of which 2 projects have been completed.


    Rs. 190.3 crores has been sanctioned to the State Forest Departments of Uttrakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West-Bengal for the year 2018-19, as a part of the afforestation program in the Ganga basin.


      * Five State Ganga Committees and 48 District Ganga Committees constituted for effective monitoring of projects and activities in the five Ganga states.


      * Participation of corporates in Namami Gange grew stronger after successful completion of two road shows in London and Mumbai. Corporates have shown their interest and commitment towards cleaning of Ganga. Countries like Australia, United Kingdom, Germany, Finland and Israel have shown keen interest in collaborating with the Indian government for river Ganga cleaning.

      * During the financial year 2018-19 (till 30.11.2018), National Mission for Clean Ganga has released Rs.1532.59 crore to the states, Central Public Sector Undertakings for the implementation of the programme, including expenditure incurred for establishment.

    1.2 E-flow notification


      * The Central Government on October 10 th 2018 notified the minimum environmental flows for River Ganga that has to be maintained at various locations on the river. Environmental flows are the acceptable flow regimes that are required to maintain a river in the desired environmental state or predetermined state. The notification issued by the Government will ensure that the river has at least the minimum required environmental flow of water even after the river flow gets diverted by projects and structures for purposes like irrigation, hydropower, domestic and industrial use etc. This was an important step taken towards maintaining the uninterrupted or Aviral flow of the river.


    1.3 Sisamau drain interception

      * One of the major achievements in the state has been the recent interception and diversion of Sisamau Nala in Kanpur, the worst pollutant for river Ganga that emptied waste water from the tanneries into the river. 140 MLD water from this drain has been intercepted and is being diverted to an STP for treatment.

    1.4 Industrial Pollution Management


      * 961 Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) have been identified on main stem of river Ganga after reinventorisation exercise carried out by CPCB (2017-18).


      * As on November, 2018, out of 961 GPIs, 795 units have connected to Online Continuous Effluent Monitoring System (OCEMS) to CPCB server.


      * Out of 961 GPIs inspected, 474 are found complying, 209 are found non-complying, 256 are found temporarily closed and 22 are found permanently closed.


      * Action has been taken against 209 Non-Complying units wherein 199 units have been issued Show Cause Notice and 10 units have been issued closure directions.


      * Zero Liquid Discharge achieved in 32 molasses based Distilleries. Due to adoption of advanced process technology, Spent wash generation in Distilleries reduced from 12-15 KL/KL to 8 KL/KL of alcohol production.


      * For Sugar industry, Charter prepared and issued for the up gradation of the manufacturing process technology, ETP system and best practises and waste minimization practises.


      * In Pulp & Paper, disposal of black liquor from agro-based industries has been prohibited and are permitted to operate with Chemical Recovery Plants (CRPs) to achieve zero black liquor discharge.


      * Estimated reduction in fresh water consumption and effluent generation are about 45%-50% as compared to the pollution level estimated in 2012, in spite of expansion in production capacity and number of units in Pulp & Paper Sector.


      * Proposal for construction of 20 MLD CETP, Collection and Conveyance system, Pilot-scale 200 KLD ZLD plant and 900 KLD Common Chrome Recovery unit at Jajmau tannery Cluster, Kanpur has been sanctioned amounting Rs.554 crores with certain financial conditions.

      * Proposal for up-gradation of existing CETP at Mathura Textile cluster has been sanctioned amounting Rs.13.87 crores with a condition that industry has to contribute 25% of project cost and 100 % O&M.

    1.5 Water Quality Monitoring

      * 36 Real Time Water Quality Monitoring Station (RTWQMS) are operational under Namami Gange programme.

      * Water quality monitoring is carried out 130 locations. Dissolved Oxygen levels improved at 39 locations, Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) decreased at 42 locations and coliform bacteria count decreased at 47 locations (2017 vs 2018 data).


      * Bio-monitoring of river Ganga at various locations (Haridwar to Diamond Harbour in West Bengal) has been carried out to study the Benthic Macro Invertebrates, which reflects the biological health of river. It has been observed that water quality of Ganga supports diversified community structure and the river stretches shows slight to moderate level of pollution with respect to Biological Water Quality Criteria (BWQC) which is a suggestive criteria considered by CPCB. There has been improving trend in the biological water quality at some of the locations.
