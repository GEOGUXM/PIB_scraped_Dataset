      Posted On: 18 DEC 2018 6:15PM by PIB Delhi


    The Department of Social Justice and Empowerment is implementing following Centrally Sponsored and Central Sector Schemes for the educational upliftment of the Scheduled Castes Students :

     1. Post Matric Scholarship for Scheduled Castes Students;
     2. Pre-Matric Scholarship for Scheduled Castes Students;
     3. National Overseas Scholarship for Scheduled Castes Students etc.;
     4. National Fellowship for Scheduled Castes Students;
     5. Central Sector Scholarship Scheme of Top Class Education for SC Students; and
     6. Free Coaching Scheme for SC and OBC Students.

    The budgetary allocation under the aforesaid schemes during the last five year is given below.


    Of the schemes mentioned in response to (a) above, Central Assistance is released to the States/UTs under the Schemes of Post Matric Scholarship for SC students and Pre Matric Scholarship for SC students. The due Central Assistance is the requirement that is over and above the Committed Liability of the States/UTs under the scheme. The due central assistance is released to the States/UTs depending upon submission of complete proposals which inter-alia includes Audit Statement of the expenditure incurred, Utilization Certificates, details of beneficiaries/demand etc. The details of the Central Assistance released during the last five years under both the Schemes are enclosed at Annexure 2. Under the Post Matric Scholarship for Scheduled Caste Students, arrears have accumulated over the 12 th Plan period due to higher than anticipated demand from States/UTs.
