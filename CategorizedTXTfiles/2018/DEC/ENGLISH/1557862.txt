Detail of this project and its present status are as under:

                                                                                           (Physical progress- 58%)
                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   

    Another project proposal was received from Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation for establishment of Defence Park at Sanand. The proposal was not considered as MIIUS permits sanction of maximum two projects per State and when this proposal was received, two proposals had already been given ‘in-principle’ approval in Gujarat. MIIUS scheme was valid till 31.03.2017 and no new projects are being taken up under this scheme.


    DIPP does not have any specific policy or scheme for assistance to promote or establish Defence Parks in States and there is no proposal at present to implement any specific scheme for providing assistance to promote or establish Defence Parks. However, consequent to the announcement in the Budget Speech (2018-19) by Finance Minister for setting up of two Defence Industrial Production Corridors in the country, the Government has decided to establish two such corridors, one in Tamil Nadu and the other in Uttar Pradesh.


    This information was given by the Minister of State of Commerce and Industry, C. R. Chaudhary, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
