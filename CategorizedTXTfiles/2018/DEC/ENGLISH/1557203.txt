    Ministry of Power, Government of India has decided to make all meters smart prepaid in 3 years from 1st April, 2019. This step is likely to bring revolution in power sector by way of r eduction in AT&C losses, better health of DISCOMs, incentivisation of energy conservation, ease of bill payments and doing away with the paper bills.


    Move towards smart meters is a pro poor step as consumers need not pay the whole month's bill in one go, instead they can pay as per their requirements. Manufacturing of smart prepaid meters will also generate skilled employment for the youth.


    It may be recalled that the State Governments had earlier signed the Power for All document and had agreed to supply 24*7 power supply to their consumers. Thus the distribution licensee shall provide 24*7 power to their consumers by 1st April, 2019 or earlier. However the appropriate Commission in exceptional circumstances for the reasons to be recorded in writing may grant extension in this time period.
