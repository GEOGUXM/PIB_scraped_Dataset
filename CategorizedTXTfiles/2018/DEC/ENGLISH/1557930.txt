      Posted On: 31 DEC 2018 3:56PM by PIB Delhi


    One hundred two Accident Black Spots have been identified in the State of Tamil Nadu, out of which 96 are on National Highways (NHs). Immediate temporary measures such as erection of cautionary sign boards, provision of rumble strips etc. have already been taken on all black spots on NHs. Permanent remedial measures have also been taken on 24 Accident Black Spots and work on 52 numbers of black spots is in the execution/bidding stage.


    To address road safety concerns, the Ministry has issued guidelines to carry out road safety audit for all the new road projects having length of 5 km or more at the stage of Detailed Project Report (DPR) / Engineering Design. Adequate mitigation measures including construction of Foot Over Bridges (FOBs), underpasses /overpasses /cattle underpasses, Road signage, Road Marking, delineators, crash barrier etc. are made as an integral part of the highways development projects depending upon the site requirement, land availability etc. The rectification of the accident black spots are carried out as a separate or as a part of corridor development project for which expenditure is incurred from the overall allocation of funds under the development of National Highways. Ministry has not allocated funds to the NGOs for rectification of Accident Black Spots.


    Minister of State for Road Transport & Highways Shri Mansukh Mandavia gave this information to Rajya Sabha in reply to a question today.
