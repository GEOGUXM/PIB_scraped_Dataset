      Posted On: 30 DEC 2018 4:39PM by PIB Delhi


    All the dignitaries present on the stage and my dear brothers and sisters of Car Nicobar.


    Yesterday I was with Mother Ganga in Varanasi and today I am here with you all in the lap of this vast sea. Just like mother Ganga has been showering her blessings on the people with her purity, this sea has been singing praises of Mother Bharti since time immemorial and providing energy to the country's security and strength.


    Friends,


    Today, as soon as I landed here, I saluted all our ancestors from various islands including Car Nicobar who had sacrificed their lives for freedom and development of this place.


    Friends,


    You not only possess nature's wonderful treasure but also have the best culture, traditions, art and skills. Just a few moments ago, the dance performance by the children shows that India's cultural richness is as profound as this ocean.


    The way you have held on to the tradition of joint family system is a great strength for our Indian way of living. This is a true example of how work, resources and labour can be divided and utilized properly and efficiently. This family institution or the family system is a great strength for our country from Kargil to Car Nicobar and Kutch to Kohima.


    Friends,


    Just a few moments back I had been to the Tsunami Memorial and the Wall of lost souls. There, I paid homage to those who had lost their lives in that horrible natural disaster. 14-15 years ago that heart-breaking event had disrupted your lives and the lives of the other people here and had snatched away your loved ones. However, the way all of you have rebuilt Car Nicobar with your hard work, is indeed commendable!


    Brothers and sisters,


    Today various projects have either been launched or their the foundation stones laid so as to improve and uplift the lives of the people of Car Nicobar with better facilities. It includes various projects ranging from education to health, employment to skill development, transportation to electricity and from sports to tourism. I congratulate you all for these projects. This is an extension of our idea of development which has its roots in development of infrastructure and connectivity i.e. 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'. This means that not a single person or any corner of the country should remain untouched by development. This is a manifestation of the same idea.


    We are working with the goal of ensuring that the gaps in expansive parts of the country are bridged and the spirit of co-existence strengthens in the hearts of the people. For the past four years, I have been relentlessly striving as a Prime Minister to personally visit every corner of the country and interact with you all.


    Friends,


    The projects that were either launched or their foundation stones laid just a few moments back also include a project on sea wall. You have been demanding for a long time the solution to the danger that was looming large due to soil erosion. Working on this demand, a sea wall will be constructed at a cost of about Rs.50 crores and I have got the opportunity to lay the foundation stone of the same. Now work will progress at a rapid pace and on the completion of this sea wall project, it will work as a protective shield for Car Nicobar.


    Friends,


    Besides security, work is also being done to ensure that the 5 streams of development – such as education for children, income for the youth, medicines for the elderly, irrigation for the farmers and addressing people's grievances – are available in Car Nicobar. I realized that the youngsters here had to travel long distances for education and training. Now the setting up of Industrial Training Institute i.e. ITI in Arong village will benefit the young friends to a great extent. The youngsters will pass out as electricians, plumbers, automotive technicians and will be able to get jobs anywhere in the country.


    Friends,


    The youngsters of Car Nicobar are today also moving towards other occupation such as towards education and health sector along with the traditional sources of income. The skill in sports is inherent in its youth. Sports are in your veins. Car Nicobar is now becoming famous for its best sporting talent in various sports including football. A few moments ago, I have also got the opportunity to meet the talented sportsmen of this place. I was told that its junior football team has won the famous Subroto Mukherjee cup four times.


    Friends,


    The modern sports complex that has been set up in Lapati village is dedicated to you for nurturing the talent here. This is the only such sports complex of Andaman and Nicobar islands. Several facilities have been added to the sports complex constructed at a cost of approximately Rs.8 crores. Apart from hostels for boys and girls, a synthetic track has also been created here.


    Car Nicobar has produced several talented players for the country in the fields of cycling, kayaking and rowing, besides football. In the future, a Velodrome for cycling and a swimming pool also will be created in the sports complex foundation stone for which has been laid today.


    Friends,


    The central government is committed to provide every resident of Andaman and Nicobar the kind of facilities associated with his or her life. Efforts are being made to improve all the facilities such as providing affordable food grains, clean water, gas connection and kerosene oil. The government is also committed to provide better health facilities especially for the people living here. The expansion of the Diglipur sub-district hospital will improve the healthcare facilities here to a large extent.


    Friends,


    The central government is striving to develop these areas according to its needs and circumstances. The government is trying to move towards development by protecting the environment and preserving its culture. The government has taken several decisions keeping this spirit in mind.


    The government has taken some important decisions for the farmers residing in the coastal areas of the country including Andaman and Nicobar islands who are associated with the farming of Copra and coconut. The MSP of Copra has been increased by about Rs.2000 per quintal. The MSP of Milling Copra has been increased from Rs.7750 to Rs.9500 per quintal and the MSP of Ball Copra has been increased from Rs.7750 to Rs.9920 per quintal. Several farmers associated with Copra farming will be benefitted out of this increase.


    Friends,


    The central government is also engaged with the work of empowering our fishermen. Recently, a special fund of Rs. 7000 crores has been created to make fishery a profitable occupation in our country. Under this, the fishermen will get loans at reasonable interest rates.


    'Our coastal areas are capable of being the centres of Blue Revolution’ – with this vision, our government is moving ahead. Several projects such as businesses related to fishery or cultivation of seaweeds are being encouraged. The government is providing financial assistance to the fishermen for availing modern boats. With this vision, packages are being provided for various schemes related to fisheries, farming and animal husbandry.


    Brothers and sisters,


    In order to preserve the environment of Car Nicobar, the prospects of cultivating and using solar power here are being assessed and groomed. Today, India is among the countries of the world where the production and use of solar energy is moving fast. We are committed to providing affordable and green energy to the country with solar energy. Today, India is providing leadership to the world for bringing about a revolution in solar energy with International Solar Alliance. India is working with the vision of 'One World, One Sun, One Grid'.


    Friends,


    The coastal areas of our country provide immense possibilities in terms of renewable energy. We are working towards turning these possibilities into opportunities. Under this scheme, a target of setting up of a Rooftop solar plant with a capacity of 300 kilowatts in Car Nicobar has also been set. I was informed that in several institutions including schools and hospitals solar panels of 50 kilowatts have already been installed and are in operation. The government is trying to ensure that all the energy needs of Car Nicobar are met by solar power in the future.


    Friends,


    Car Nicobar, this sea and the Malacca strait are significant for both resources and security. This is a major shipping channel between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. This is the busiest route of the world for the cargo ships. Keeping this in mind, the modes of transportation are also being developed. This will not only provide benefits to you all but will also open up employment opportunities.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Keeping in mind the needs of the country, the foundation stone of Trans-shipment Port has also been laid today. This project will create opportunities for new enterprises in the southern part of the Gulf.


    Also, under the Sagarmala scheme, there is a massive plan to upgrade the infrastructure for developing the coastal areas of the country. Under this scheme, hundreds of projects are under construction at a cost of approximately Rs.2.5 lakh crores. 14 Coastal Employment Zones (i.e. CEZs) will be developed around the coastal areas of the country in the near future.


    Friends,


    Prime Minister Modi said, Under the Sagarmala scheme, the decision of extending Campbell Bay jetty to 150 metres at a cost of approximately Rs.50 crores in Car Nicobar has been made. Besides, plans have also been made to increase the depth of Mus Jetty so that large ships do not face problems in mooring here.


    Brothers and sisters,


    The government is also working towards improving the air connectivity to this region in the coming days. The government is striving to improve your lives and uplift the standard of living.


    Friends,


    I also express my heartfelt gratitude to the Tribal Council. You are playing an important role in strengthening the country's democracy and accelerating the pace of development here. I have been told that the sisters and the daughters here have good participation rate in the Village Council. These efforts too are commendable.


    The government is fully committed to the development of Car Nicobar. In the coming New Year, our efforts will continue with fresh zeal and enthusiasm!


    In the end, once again I congratulate you all for the various development projects.


    Thanks a lot! Jai Hind!
