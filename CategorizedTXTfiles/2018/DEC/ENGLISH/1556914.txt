Under Digital India Programme MeitY has effectively utilised Digital technologies to transform the lives of people while ensuring digital inclusion of all the segments. The Government is committed to provide governance and services to our citizens in an affordable and efficient manner within the shortest span of time.
          + Through Aadhaar, the Government has provided digital identity to 122.9 crore residents of the country with 99% coverage of adult population as on 30 th November, 2018. Earlier, a substantial percentage of population, especially the economically poor and the rural segment, women and children, did not have an identity card by which they could access a service. Aadhaar has given individuals a Government issued ID card which can be authenticated any time anywhere. Aadhaar combined with Digital Locker, eSign, and various forms of digital payments have paved the way for common man getting services on his mobile instead of having to run to multiple Government offices.

    As a result, the production of LCD/ LED TVs has gone up from 1.5 crore units in 2016-17 to 1.6 crore units in 2017-18. The production value of Light Emitting Diode (LED) Products has gone up from ₹7,134 crore in 2016-17 to ₹9,630 crore in 2017-18.

          + Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order 2017: The Government has issued Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order 2017 to encourage ‘Make in India’ and to promote manufacturing and production of goods and services in India with a view to enhancing income and employment.

    In furtherance of the aforesaid Order MeitY has notified for 11 Electronic Products viz., Desktop PCs, Laptop PCs, Tablet PCs, Dot Matrix Printers, Contact and Contactless Smart Cards, LED Products, Biometric Access Control/ Authentication Devices, Biometric Finger Print Sensors, Biometric Iris Sensors, Servers, and Cellular Mobile Phones vide Notification No. 33(1)/2017-IPHW dated 14.09.2017 and Notification No. 33(5)/2017-IPHW dated 01.08.2018, respectively. The Electronic Product Notifications will help stimulate the flow of capital and technology, create employment opportunities, promote higher value addition in the electronic products manufactured in the country and reduce dependence on imports.


          + Electronics and Information Technology Goods (Requirements for Compulsory Registration) Order, 2012: Keeping in view the safety of Indian consumers and to curb the inflow of substandard electronic products, the “Electronics and Information Technology Goods (Requirements for Compulsory Registration) Order, 2012” was notified on 3 rd October, 2012 under the provision of Compulsory Registration Scheme of BIS Act, 1986. This Order had come into effect from 3 rd July, 2013. So far, 44 products categories have been added to the schedule of the Order and the Order has come into effect for all the notified products/ standards.


    The Indian Language support for Mobile Phones as per IS 16333 (Part 3) has been added to the schedule of this Order on 24 th October, 2016. The standard provides for inputting of text in English, Hindi and at least one additional Indian official language along with facility of readability in the phones for all 22 Indian official languages and script supporting these languages. The Order has come into effect from 1 st May, 2018.


    The Compulsory Registration Scheme has resulted in high compliance of notified electronic goods to Indian safety standards and more than 15,000 registrations have been granted by BIS to manufacturing units covering approximately 75,000 products models/ series.


     1. To promote the use of electronics in healthcare, agriculture, energy and environment, transportation, Safety and security, communication and computing, R&D projects have been taken up in the sector of Medical Electronics and Health Informatics (ME&HI), Electronics System Design and Application (ESDA), Electronics Material and Component Development (EMCD), Microelectronics Development, Nanotechnology with main focus on Nanoelectronics and Computer Security. Followings are the achievements during the year 2018 -

          + Design and development of 64-bit Microprocessor by IIT Madras and 32-bit Microprocessor by IIT Bombay designed using Open Source Instruction Set Architectures (ISA) fabricated successfully at 180nm technology node of SCL Mohali.
          + Four numbers of 6 MV LINAC developed for the treatment of cancer. Three of them have been deployed at Indian Institute of Head and Neck Oncology, Indore, Amravati Cancer Foundation, Amravati and BKL Walawalkar Hospital, Chiplun. On an average 30 patients are being treated per day on these machines. Technology has been transferred to industry.
          + Centre of Excellence on Tactile Graphics has been established at IIT Delhi for development of tactile diagrams for Divyang. Tactile diagrams created for text books i.e. Science & Math books for Grades 6 to 10, India map book etc. for visually impaired children. A start-up company under the project “Centre of excellence in tactile graphics” has been incubated for production of tactile diagrams.
          + Various devices developed/are being developed under the Centres of Excellence in Nanoelectronics setup.
          + An Aadhaar enabled cloud based Personal Health Record Management System (PHRMS) application has been designed to store Personal Health record of Individuals. System is deployed on National Health Portal server.

          + Specialized Manpower Generation -

              o An umbrella Programme “Special Manpower Development Programme in Chips to System Design (SMDP-C2SD)” has been initiated with the aim to generate specialized manpower in the area of VLSI design and to develop System-on-Chip/ System. 28,000 numbers of specialised manpower generated in last 3 years and 15 projects taken up for the development of 70 Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and 30 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based board level design. State-of-the-art VLSI designs labs setup at 60 institutes. About 30 Chips fabricated at SCL Mohali & other foundries.
              o To train specialised research manpower in the area of Nanoelectronics using the R&D facility established at IISc, Bangalore and IIT Bombay, a joint program “Indian Nanoelectronics Users Program (INUP)” has been started and utilised by the researchers across the country for proof of concept of their ideas. There are around 410 publications and 30 patents under this program.

          + To secure the cyber space following key actions have been initiated -

              o Cyber Swachhta Kendra (Botnet Cleaning and Malware Analysis Centre) has been launched by the Government in February, 2017 for detection of systems infected by malware/ botnets in the country and to notify, enable cleaning and securing systems of end users to prevent further malware infections by providing free bot removal tool via web portal.
              o Free bot removal tool downloaded in the year 2017 are 4,78,508. The number of Free bot removal tool downloaded in the year 2018 are 8,18,910.
              o Government has initiated setting up of National Cyber Coordination Centre (NCCC) to generate necessary situational awareness of existing and potential cyber security threats and enable timely information sharing for proactive, preventive and protective actions by individual entities. Phase-I of NCCC has been made operational.

     1. All this ensures that with the aim of Minimum Government Maximum Governance, ease of living of the citizens is at the core of Digital India. This has laid a robust foundation for India to become one of the leaders in digital transformation.
