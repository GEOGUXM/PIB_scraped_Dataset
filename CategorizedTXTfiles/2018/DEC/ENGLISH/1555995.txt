    A delegation of railway officers approached Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh for intervention by Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) for redressal of their cadre related issues.


    Led by Shri Anand Mathur, President, Indian Railway Personnel Officers Association (Regd.) (IRPOA), the members of the delegation presented a memorandum to the Minister expressing their gratitude to him because the DoPT had approved the recommendations of the Cadre Review Committee (CRC) for encadrement of the post of Member Staff (MS) in Railway Board. The members, however, stated that the Railway Board had taken a different view on this matter.


    The memorandum also claimed that the officers of IRPS cadre had experience of handling matters relating to establishment, cadre management, industrial relations & labour laws and thus possess varied experience in managing cadre of all employees in all the departments. The officers therefore solicited the kind intervention.


    Dr Jitendra Singh said that he would find out all the details related to the matter and take an appropriate view.
