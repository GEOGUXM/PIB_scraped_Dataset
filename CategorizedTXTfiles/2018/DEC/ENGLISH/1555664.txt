      Posted On: 12 DEC 2018 5:04PM by PIB Delhi


    ISRO is planning to launch more state-of-the-art satellites in the near future encompassing, optical remote sensing, microwave remote sensing, Infra Red remote sensing (IR). Also making scientific missions to moon and the communication satellites to provide high throughput communication links as well as Direct To Home (DTH) applications. These satellites will address various user requirements.


    These satellites will be realized and launched by the coming three years.


    The details of the financial allocations are as following:
