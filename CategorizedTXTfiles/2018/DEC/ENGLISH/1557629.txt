      Posted On: 28 DEC 2018 4:29PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government of India has initiated the Capacity Building Programme for Elected Women Representatives (EWRs) of Panchayati Raj Institutions with an objective of empowering them by developing leadership capacities so that they serve as catalysts for social change and function as peer facilitators in the field, become vocal for their rights and participate effectively in the governance processes.


    State Governments have been actively involved in imparting these trainings. Mainly, State Institute of Rural Developments (SIRDs) and State Resource Centres (SRCs) are actively collaborating with Ministry of Women and Child Development in conducting training programmes across the States. Convergence with various Departments at the district level is being sought while organizing the training programme. This involves collaborating with institutions of the Departments of Panchayati Raj, Agriculture, Women & Child Development, Rural Development, etc. In Phase-I of the programme (2017-18), a total 18,578 EWRs in 14 States were trained. In Phase-II, 18 States have been included for capacity building programmes for EWRs.

    The Capacity Building Programme undertaken by Ministry of Women and Child Development is a significant endeavour in creating a forum for EWRs to understand their roles and responsibilities in a more prolific manner. Although it is the first step towards harnessing the full potential of EWRs, but this is envisioned as a continuous process in order to instill confidence, courage, conviction, motivation and above all providing hand-holding support to EWRs for mainstreaming them in the governance process.


    This was stated by Minister of State for Women and Child Development Ministry, Dr VirendraKumar in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
