    The annual allocation to Ministry of DoNER under NLCPR scheme is determined through the normal budgetary process of the Government of India. Earmarked spending by Central Ministries in the North Eastern Region have contributed to improved connectivity and infrastructure. In recent years, the average growth rate of NE states has been relatively higher than the all India average.
