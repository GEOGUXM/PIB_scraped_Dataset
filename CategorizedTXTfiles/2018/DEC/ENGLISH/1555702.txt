      Posted On: 11 DEC 2018 5:57PM by PIB Delhi


    Sugar production during last sugar season 2017-18 was about322 Lakh MT which is highest production so far in the country. Sugar production during current sugar season 2018-19 is estimated to be about 315 Lakh MT which is almost of the same level of previous season. As of now, India is the second largest producer of sugar in the world. In order to improve the liquidity position of the sugar mill to facilitate clearance of cane arrears of farmers and to divert surplus sugar for ethanol production, Government has fixed remunerative price of ethanol produced from B-Hy molasses and diverted from cane juice. These measures may lower sugar production.


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food &Public Distribution, Shri C.R. Chaudhary in Lok Sabha.
