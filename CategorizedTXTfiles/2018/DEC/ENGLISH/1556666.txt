    Under the provisions of the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act. 2015 and Rules made thereunder, so far 25 coal mines (24 to private companies and 1 to a Government Company) have been allocated through Electronic Auction till date. The methodology for auction of coal mines / blocks for sale of coal under the provisions of the CM (SP) Act, 2015 and the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 [MM(DR) Act, 1957] has been approved by the Government and Order in this regard has been issued on 27.2.2018.


    As per the current import policy, coal is kept under Open General License (OGL) and consumers are free to import coal from the source of their choice as per their contractual prices on payment of applicable duty. There has been a consistent effort to increase domestic coal production so as to reduce dependence on coal imports. The all India raw coal production has increased from 565.77 MT in 2013-14 to 676.48 MT in 2017-18. Absolute increase in all India coal production from 2013-14 to 2017-18 (four years) is 110.71 MT as compared to increase of coal production of 33.73 MT from 2009-10 to 2013-14 (four years).


    Coal India Limited (CIL) has also increased its production from 462.41 MT in 2013-14 to 567.36 MT in 2017-18 (four years), an absolute increase of 105 MT as compared to increase of coal production of 31.15 MT between 2009-10 and 2013-14 (four years).


    Further, in the current year during April-November, 2018, all India coal production was 433.90 MT with a growth rate of 9.8% and coal production of CIL was 358.32 MT with a growth rate of 8.8% over the corresponding period of previous year.


    However, coking coal will continue to be imported as there is limited availability of coking coal in the country. Further, power plants designed on imported coal will also continue to import coal.


    This information was given by the Minister of Coal & Railways, Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
