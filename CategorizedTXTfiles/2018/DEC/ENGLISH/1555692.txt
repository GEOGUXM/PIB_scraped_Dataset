      Food Security Scheme
      Posted On: 11 DEC 2018 5:52PM by PIB Delhi


    National Food Security Act, 2013 provides for identification of beneficiaries under two categories- Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and Priority Households(PHH). While the eligible families under AAY are to be identified as per the criteria evolved for the scheme, the identification under PHH is to be done as per the criteria evolved by the States/UTs. There is no report of any eligible beneficiary being left out of National Food Security Act. Therefore, the question of conduct of fresh survey does not arise .


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri C.R. Chaudhary in Lok Sabha.
