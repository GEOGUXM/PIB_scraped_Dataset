The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has also compiled more than 100 mobile apps developed by ICAR, State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) and Krishi Vigyan Kendras and uploaded on its website. These mobile apps have been developed in the areas of crops, horticulture, veterinary, dairy, poultry, fisheries, natural resource management and integrated subjects. These apps offers valuable information to the farmers, including package of practices, market prices of various commodities, weather related information, advisory services, etc.


    Farmers can get information on farm subsidies; dealers of Seed, Pesticide, Fertilizer, Farm Machinery; crop insurance and subsidies; under various schemes through main portal of the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare i.e. agricoop.gov.in. and Farmers’ portal i.e. https://farmer.gov.in/ . Farmers’ portal provides information on all agriculture related areas through a single umbrella. Farmers can also get scheme-wise information from the portals of the Sub-mission on Agriculture Mechanization ( https://farmech.dac.gov.in/ ); Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture ( https://midh.gov.in/ ); Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana ( https://pmksy.gov.in/ ); Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana ( https://pmfby.gov.in/ ); Soil Health Card Scheme ( https://soilhealth.dac.gov.in/ ); National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm ( https://nmoop.gov.in/ ); National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development; ( https://www.nabard.org/content.aspx?id=602 ); National Mission For Sustainable Agriculture ( https://nmsa.dac.gov.in/ ); etc.
