Similarly, Madame Tussauds Wax Museum visitors will be getting an attractive discount of 30% on combo packages of NRM. It is envisaged that this innovative, first time ever, public-private museum collaboration, shall attract more tourists to both National Rail Museum and Madame Tussauds Wax Museum. In this regard, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed between Ministry of Railways and Madame Tussauds Wax Museum. Secretary, Railway Board, Shri Ranjanesh Sahai, Director & General Manager of Madame Tussauds, Shri Anshul Jain, Sr. Officials of Ministry of Railways and other dignitaries were also present on the occasion.


    In addition, there will be a special provision for school groups. School children will be able to enjoy both museums at a 45% discount. This will help in promoting railway heritage and also enable children to learn about national heroes, thereby making the student excursion more inclusive, holistic and interesting.


    Delhi has many popular museums but most of them require individual ticketing. The broader vision of this collaboration is to spread the concept of a discounted single ticket for accessing more museums, even spanning over 3-4 days. This will not only be convenient to tourists, it will also promote tourism industry. Similar facility is already available in major tourist cities across world.
