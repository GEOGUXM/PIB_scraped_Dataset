      Government refutes speculations on interim appointments in CBI
      Posted On: 03 DEC 2018 4:48PM by PIB Delhi


    Reports have appeared in a section of the media to the effect that the Government is considering the following two options to end the alleged policy paralysis in CBI:-

     1. Appointing an OSD of DG rank to look after the affairs of the CBI
     2. To place a senior IAS officer in a supervisory role.

    The Government of India strongly refutes this imputations. It is clarified that the Government has taken the step of divesting the present Director and Special Director of the CBI of their powers under section 4(2) of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 as an interim measure.


    The matter is sub judice before the Supreme Court and any action that is to be taken will be strictly in accordance with the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the pending proceedings and not before the Hon’ble Supreme Court decides the matter. What is stated in the reports are absolutely false.
