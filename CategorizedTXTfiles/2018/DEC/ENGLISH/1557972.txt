    During Kala Utsav 2015 to 2017, group competitions were held in four art forms: Dance, Music, Theatre, Visual Arts (Drawing, Painting, Sculpture, Crafts) where each State/UT sent one team for each form of art. However, during 2018, solo competitions were held in four art forms: Vocal Music, Instrumental Music, Dance, Painting, where each State/UT had to send two entries i.e. one male and one female student in each art form, in order to identify and showcase individual talent.


    Arts integration in education helps to encourage creativity, develop problem solving ability and improve the ability to handle mental imagery for better expression. Kala Utsav has been structured as an art festival to include performances and display of exhibits. The design of Kala Utsav helps students explore, understand and showcase their artistic talent by practicing different art forms. This event gives students the opportunity to understand and celebrate cultural diversity at the school, district, state and national levels. It creates awareness about India’s cultural heritage and its vibrant diversity among students and other stakeholders. Kala Utsav helps in enhancing the various skills of the participants and prepares them as ambassadors of our culture. Kala Utsav is also an effort to mainstream students with special needs (differently-abled and from diverse socio-economic backgrounds) and celebrating their abilities.
