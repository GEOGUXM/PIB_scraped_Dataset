      Incentives to Sports persons
      Posted On: 20 DEC 2018 2:34PM by PIB Delhi


    Incentives in the form of Cash awards are given to medal winners in international sports events of various sports disciplines including those of Football, Hockey, Badminton, Lawn Tennis. Cash awards are given in accordance with the provisions of the Scheme of ‘Special Awards to Medal Winners in International Sports Events and their Coaches’. As Cricket is at present not included in Olympic Games/Asian Games/Commonwealth Games, no cash award is given to sportspersons belonging to cricket. However, Blind Cricket World Cup (held in four years) is included in the Scheme of Special Awards and medal winners in Blind Cricket World Cup have been given cash award.


    A statement indicating the amount of cash award given to sportspersons in different international sports events is at Annexure.


    Responsibility for promotion and development of specific sports disciplines is that of concerned National Sports Federations (NSF). Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports and the Sports Authority of India (SAI) supplement the efforts of the NSFs.


    This information was given by Minister of State (Independent Charge) forYouth Affairs and Sports Shri Col. Rajyavardhan Rathore Retd in a written reply to the Lok Sabha today.
