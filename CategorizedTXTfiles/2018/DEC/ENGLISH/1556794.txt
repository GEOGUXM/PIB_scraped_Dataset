      Utilization Ofmplad Funds
      Posted On: 19 DEC 2018 3:51PM by PIB Delhi


    Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation releases annual entitlement of Rs. 5 crore of MPLAD fund in two equal installments to the Nodal District Authority opted by Hon’ble MPs. Utilization of released funds is to be done by respective District Authorities only on the basis of recommendations made by Hon’ble MPs. The utilization certificate is a statement by the District Authority that the funds have been utilized as per the scheme guidelines and facilitates the release of further funds under the MPLAD scheme. There have been delays in submission of utilization certificates by District Authorities on account of various reasons and this has been in discussion in several meetings related with MPLAD Scheme. Accordingly a proposal to release the full amount of Rs. 5.0 crore of MPLADS fund for one year in one go is under consideration in consultation with Ministry of Finance.


    State wise details of Districts which have been provided entire funds for five years i.e. Rs. 25 crore in 16th Lok Sabha (as on 10.12.2018) are as under:
