      Increase in Price of Essential Food Items
      Posted On: 11 DEC 2018 5:56PM by PIB Delhi


    The all India yearly average retail prices of most of the 22 essential food items monitored by Department of Consumer Affairs have declined or remained relatively stable over three years including the year 2018 so far. Prices of food items like pulses (gram, tur, urad, moong, masoor) and edible oils like mustard and groundnut (packed) have declined over three years. However, food items like rice, atta, vanaspati oil, soya oil and palm oil (packed), onion and milk have shown some marginal increase. Details are at Annexure.


    Increase in prices of food items is mainly on account of demand supply mismatch owing to shortfall in production because of adverse weather condition and seasonality, increased transportation costs, supply chain constraints like lack of storage facilities and artificial shortage created by hoarding and black marketing.


    Government has taken various measures from time to time to stabilize prices of essential food items which, inter-alia, include appropriately utilizing trade and fiscal policy instruments like import and export duty, Minimum Export Price, export restrictions, etc. to regulate domestic availability and moderate prices; imposition of stock limits and advising States for effective action against hoarders & black marketers ; and, provision of higher Minimum Support Prices to incentivize farmers for increasing production. Government is also implementing Schemes which, inter alia , include Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), National Food Security Mission (NFSM), National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP), etc for increasing agricultural production and productivity through appropriate interventions. Besides, Government is also implementing Price Stabilization Fund (PSF) to help moderate the volatility in prices of agri-horticultural commodities like pulses, onion, and potato.
