    The Government of India/Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will continue to have the flexibility to modify the notified amount and timing for auction of Treasury Bills depending upon the requirements of the Government of India, evolving market conditions and other relevant factors. Thus, the calendar is subject to change, if circumstances so warrant including for reasons such as intervening holidays. Such changes, if any, will be communicated through regular press releases.


    The Auction of Treasury Bills will be subject to the terms and conditions specified in the General Notification No. F4(2)-W&M/2018 dated March 27, 2018 issued by the Government of India, as amended from time to time.
