      NH Construction Target
      Posted On: 20 DEC 2018 4:45PM by PIB Delhi


    The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has set a target of construction of 10,000 km of National Highways (NHs) in the country during current financial year 2018-19. As against this target for the full year, the Ministry has achieved construction of National Highways of 5759 km i.e. 57.59% as on 30.11.2018. The achievement so far is by and large in consonance with the annual target keeping in view that the period of 3 months from July to September is the rainy season, when the pace of construction considerably slows down. The Ministry is hopeful of exceeding the annual target during the FY 2018-19.


    There is no lack of coordination among the Central Ministries. However, challenges are encountered in timely acquisition of land, shifting of utilities (like electrical lines, Water supply lines etc.) coming in the Right of Way of the Highway, time taken in obtaining statutory clearances (such as forest, tree-felling, wildlife clearances etc.) problems encountered in availability of soil/ aggregate etc. Most of these challenges relate to the states, which are sorted out through regular monitoring and reviews with the state authorities.


    This information was given by Union Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways Shri Mansukh L Mandaviya in a statement in the Lok Sabha today.
