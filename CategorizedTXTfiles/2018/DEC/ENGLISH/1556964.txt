    Under the National Health Mission, ASHAs are envisaged to be community health volunteers and are entitled only to task/activity based incentives. The incentives to ASHAs finalized at the national level are regularly reviewed by the Government and activities for which ASHAs would get incentives are expanded from time to time. The Government of India has recently approved increase in the amount of routine and recurring incentives under National Health Mission for ASHAs that will enable ASHAs to get at least Rs 2000/- per month subject to ASHAs carrying out the activities.
