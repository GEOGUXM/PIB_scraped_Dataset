      INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY


      The International Centre for Automotive Technology (ICAT) completed the first BS-VI certification for a heavy duty engine model for M/s Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicle Limited. The engine has been developed and manufactured indigenously by Volvo Eicher in India. The successful completion of the compliance test of the engine, much ahead of the implementation date of 1 April, 2020, gives sufficient time for product stabilization to make it more robust and cost competitive for the end consumers.


      The pro-active approach from the Government of India has made the country leapfrog from the conventional BS-IV to directly adopt BS-VI emission norms as the next level for regulatory framework in India. The BS-VI emission standards integrate substantial changes to existing emission standards ensuring cleaner products to the consumer. Besides the more stringent limits on the gaseous emission components, the particulate matter (PM) limits have also been significantly reduced along with the introduction of particle number (PN) limits.


      ICAT is the first of new world class centers established under the National Automotive Testing and R&D Infrastructure Project (NATRiP) with the main objective of carrying out Research & Development besides extending homologation facilities in the field of Automotive Engineering. It has emerged as a comprehensive technical partner of the automotive industry.


      ICAT is one of the prime testing agencies recognized by the Government of India as one of the accredited 'Type Approval and Homologation' agencies under Central Motor Vehicle Rules (CMVR) and has also been recognized as Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (SIRO) by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), since Feb 2010, by BIS for Tyre Testing and Safety Glasses and by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for emission and noise testing of generator sets.


      Heavy Industries Minister, Anant Geete at the International Centre for Automotive Technology (ICAT) at Manesar


      National Automotive Testing and R&D Infrastructure Project (NATRIP) was inaugurated by Union Minister of Heavy Industries & Public Enterprise (HI &PE), Anant Geete at the International Centre for Automotive Technology (ICAT) at Manesar in Haryana. ICAT has been rendering services of automotive testing & certification to the industry since 2006.


      NATRIP is the largest and most significant initiative in the automotive sector which represents collaboration between the Government of India, a number of State Governments and Indian Automotive Industry to create a state of the art testing, validation and R&D infrastructure in the country.


      The augmented facilities have been completed at ICAT Centre-II at Manesar in Haryana.


      The newly opened labs have the following facilities:


      · Noise Vibration & Harshness (NVH) Lab


      · Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Lab


      · Passive Safety Lab (PSL)


      · Tyre Test Lab (TTL)


      ICAT Certification to prevent use of forged certificates:


      International Centre for Automotive Technology (ICAT) launched Certification with high security features in order to prevent use of forged certificates.


      This is a first of its kind initiative taken by any automotive certification agency in India for enhancing the security of the CMVR certificates which includes Type Approval Certificates (TAC) and Conformity of Production (COP) Certificates for vehicles, engines and components.


      The new ICAT certificate format consists of nine new and unique security features. The unique features in the certificate are:


      · High security paper


      · Printing using the ultraviolet ink


      · Troymark


      · Microprint


      · Pantograph


      · Reverse Pantograph


      · Secure code


      · Print code


      · Digitally printed stamp and seal of ICAT


      While some of the security features are generic in nature same for all the certificates), the other features are specific for each certificate i.e. the contents or the information covered through these features will be specific for that particular certificate. Another distinction is that some of the features are visible only through ultraviolet light. The certificates will be printed using special printers which have been imported by ICAT for this very purpose.


      With the new high security features it will become difficult to forge or counterfeit the ICAT certificate.


      ICAT is the premier certification agency authorized by Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) for providing testing and certification services to the vehicle and component manufacturers situated within India and abroad. In addition to the certification services, ICAT is providing extensive testing services for product development and validation.
