      Eklavya Model Residential Schools
      Posted On: 17 DEC 2018 3:14PM by PIB Delhi


    In the context of establishing quality residential schools for the promotion of education, Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRSs) for ST students are set up in States / UTs with provisioning of funds through “Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution”. The establishing of EMRSs are based on demand of the concerned States/UTs with availability of land as an essential attribute. As per the budget 2018-19, every block with more than 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons, will have an Eklavya Model Residential School by the year 2022.


    Across the country, as per census 2011 figures, there are 564 sub-districts, i.e. blocks/taluka/tehsils, having more than 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons. Out of these sub-districts, at present 102 sub-districts have EMRSs and the rest 462 sub-districts do not have an EMRS. Out of this, there are 13 sub-districts in Assam without an EMR Sand these are listed below:-
