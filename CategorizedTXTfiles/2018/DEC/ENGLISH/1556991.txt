    Section 61 of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, (JJ Act) 2015, mandates that adoption shall be finalised by a court order within a period of two months from the date of filing. The Ministry has proposed to amend the provisions of the JJ Act, 2015 to replace “court” with “District Magistrate” under Sections 56(5), 58 (3), 58(4), 59(7), 59(8), 60(1), 61(1), 61(2), (63), (64), and 65(4) of the JJ Act, 2015. The proposal is under consideration of the Government at this stage.
