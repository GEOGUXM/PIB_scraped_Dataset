    Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shri Radha Mohan Singh met Ms. Ruhsar Pekcan, Turkish Trade Minister today and called for extending cooperation between the two countries through greater interaction among government agricultural institutions, experts, scientists and agro business.


    The Minister said that the government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has resolved to double farmers’ income by 2022 through a series of focused programmes including Soil Health Card, organic farming, crop insurance, irrigation, e-NAM and focus on strengthening post-harvest management so as to ensure better returns to the farmers. He further added that India has made tremendous progress in agriculture and allied sectors in the last few years. He said “India has achieved food security and become a net exporter of agriculture commodities.”


    Reflecting on the longstanding, close & friendly relations between India and Turkey, the Minister urged both sides to prioritize the sectors for cooperation and also identify nodal officers so that progress can be made on the MoU signed between the two countries. An MoU was signed between India and Turkey based on which the 1st Meeting of the Steering Committee was held in India in 2010. A Work Plan had also been prepared.
