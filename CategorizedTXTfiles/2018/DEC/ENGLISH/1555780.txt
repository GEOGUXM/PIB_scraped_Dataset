The objectives of the NMG were to:

      * Achieve cashless, contactless and paperless transaction, in line with Digital India objectives.
      * Increase overall efficiency leading to significant cost saving on government expenditure in Procurement.
      * Maximizing ease in availability of all types of products and services bought by Government buyers.

    During the mission, 315 events and training programs conducted across 31 states in which there were 22,838 participants. For central Ministries and CPSUs 106 events were conducted in which there were 5,990 participants. In addition to this, there were 18 theme based events organized at National Level covering critical areas of intervention like GeM design and architecture, localization, quality assurance, legal frameworks GeM payments, credit facility, OEMS, education, health and power in which there were 2,222 participants.

    GeM has brought transparency, efficiency, and inclusiveness in public procurement. It has reduced the time of procurements, reduced the process and enabled ease of doing business for both buyers and vendors. There is huge savings in the cost of procurement, ranging from a minimum of 10% to 45% in different categories. The average saving based on the MRP/Listed price is about 28%.
