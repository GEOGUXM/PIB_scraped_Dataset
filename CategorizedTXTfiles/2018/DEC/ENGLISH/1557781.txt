      Posted On: 29 DEC 2018 8:01PM by PIB Delhi


    Victory to Mother India! Victory to Mother India! Victory to Mother India! I want you all to raise one slogan along with me. I will say Maharaja Suheldev and you will say Amar Rahe twice by putting up both your hands.


    Maharaja Suheldev Amar Rahe Amar Rahe! Maharaja Suheldev Amar Rahe Amar Rahe! Maharaja Suheldev Amar Rahe Amar Rahe! Maharaja Suheldev Amar Rahe Amar Rahe!


    My dear brothers and sisters who have gathered here in large numbers!


    I am extremely delighted to have once again come here to Ghazipur, the land that produced heroes for the defense of the country and the sages who had stepped on this soil. Your enthusiasm and zeal have always been the source for my energy. Even today, you all have come here in such huge numbers to bless me in this cold winter month. I salute you all for this.


    Friends,


    During my tour in Uttar Pradesh today, several important steps will be taken to make Purvanchal a major medical hub in the country, to create an important center of research related to agriculture and to strengthen UP's small industries. A few moments ago, the foundation stone of the new Medical College to be set up in Ghazipur was laid.


    Today, another virtuous thing has been done to enhance the pride of the Purvanchal and the entire Uttar Pradesh. These opportunities are meant to enhance the dignity of every corner of the country. Every Indian was reminded of his or her country, its culture, the heroes and their bravery today. Just a few moments back, a commemorative postal stamp was released in the memory of Maharaja Suheldev with the nation saluting his saga of bravery. This postal stamp worth Rs.5 is going to reach every household of the country through the post offices across the country. A humble attempt to spread awareness upon the great contributions made by Maharaja Suheldev is being made through this postal stamp.


    Friends,


    Maharaja Suheldev was among those heroes who had struggled for defending the honor of Mother Bharti. Commemorating a hero like Maharaja Suheldev from whom the deprived section of the society seeks inspiration, accentuates the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'. They used to say that during the rule of Maharaja Suheldev, people didn't feel the need to lock their houses. He did a lot to empower the poor and to make the lives of the people easier during his rule. He had constructed roads, planted gardens, opened schools, established temples and gave a very beautiful look to his kingdom. When foreigners tried to attack the land of India, then Maharaja Suheldev was among the brave hearts who had fought and defeated the enemies. He had asked the kings from the nearby kingdoms to join him to fight against the enemies and had terrified them. Maharaja Suheldev's life was the best example of an extraordinary warrior, a skilled strategist and a creator of a strong union. He used to move along with everyone. He was for everyone.


    Brothers and sisters,


    It is a responsibility of our government to salute and pay the most deserved tribute to these warriors; the honor and tribute that was never shown to them ever before by the previous governments.


    Brothers and sisters,


    When we talk about Maharaja Suheldev, one cannot forget about the place Chitaura of Bahraich Janapada. It was on that land where Maharaja had defeated the attackers. The Uttar Pradesh government under the leadership of Yogi ji has decided to build a statue of Maharaja Suheldev in that place to remind the coming generations of his grand victory. I congratulate the Uttar Pradesh government for this idea, this monument and for reviving the history and my best wishes to one and all and I hope that all of you continue to seek inspiration from Maharaja Suheldev.


    The central government led by BJP is determined to ensure that the memories of those who have played a crucial role in the country's security and defense and have uplifted India's social life will not be ever forgotten. Dust won't be allowed to settle on the golden pages of our history and ancient culture.


    Friends,


    Maharaja Suheldev was not only a great warrior but also a kind and a compassionate soul. We are trying our best to imbibe the same virtue of compassion in the government and the system. The central government and the UP government are making sincere efforts to empower the poor, the deprived, the depressed, the Dalits, the backward and the oppressed section of the society and to make them self-reliant so that they are able to enjoy all their rights. We are working with this dream. We want their voices to reach the system.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Today the government is easily accessible to the general public and is trying to look for permanent solutions to the problems. Our government has completely changed the previous tradition of making instant announcements and making new launches for votes. One can see the change in the values and conduct of the government. This is the reason why the poor today is being heard.


    Friends,


    The campaign of providing a dignified life to the person in the lowest strata of the society is at a nascent stage. The government has succeeded in building a strong foundation now but the work of constructing a robust structure on the foundation still remains. The expansion of the health services in Purvanchal is a step taken in this direction. The pace of developing Purvanchal, one of the least developed areas in terms of healthcare, as a Medical hub has been accelerating.


    Brothers and sisters,


    The Medical College, the foundation stone of which has been laid just a few moments ago, will not only provide modern medical facilities but will also produce new and brilliant doctors in Ghazipur. The youngsters here will be able to fulfil their dreams of becoming doctors. When this college to be constructed at a cost of about Rs.250 crores will be completed, then the district hospital of Ghazipur will have a capacity of 300 beds. This hospital will benefit the people of nearby districts along with that of Ghazipur. This has been your demand for a long time and your favorite, our colleague Manoj Sinha ji kept on voicing this demand. Very soon, this hospital will be at your service. Besides, the facility of a maternity hospital with 100 beds has also been added in Ghazipur. The facility of modern ambulances has also been added to the district hospital. These facilities will be expanded in the near future.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Health facilities worth rupees thousands of crores - such as the new Medical College of Ghazipur, AIIMS at Gorakhpur, several modern hospitals being set up in Varanasi and the expansion of the old hospitals - are being developed in Purvanchal.


    Friends,


    For the first time in the history of independent India, health of the poor and the middle class is being prioritized to such a great extent. The Ayushman Bharat Yojana or the PMJAY is also referred to as Modicare by some. Efforts are being made to ensure that the benefits of PMJAY Ayushman Bharat Yojana are delivered to the maximum number of people. Under this scheme, free treatment of up to Rs.5 lakh for serious ailments like cancer has been ensured. Just within 100 days, free treatment of about 6.5 lakh poor brothers and sisters has either been already done or is going on in the hospitals across the country. Among them, more than 14000 brothers and sisters from Uttar Pradesh have also been benefitted. And they are the ones who were earlier waiting for the death to come after having struggled with the serious ailments for 2, 4 or 5 years. They feared that the treatment might push the entire family into debt. Earlier they didn't purchase medicines and suffered. Ayushman Bharat has empowered these people and has boosted their morale so that they visit hospitals for treatment. Their operations are being conducted and they are happily returning to their homes after getting treated. Moreover, the government is now trying to connect every family of the country with schemes like Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Yojana and Suraksha Bima Yojana . These schemes are in operation at low premium rates of 90 paise per day and Re.1 per month, so that the people can get financial assistance of up to Rs.2 lakh in times of adversity. More than 20 crore people across the country are now associated with both the schemes. Of these people, about 1.75 crores are from Uttar Pradesh. Rs.3000 crores has reached the needy families out of which the claimants of about Rs.400 crores are from Uttar Pradesh.


    Friends,


    Rs.400 crores at a premium of 90 paise have reached these families and empowered them.


    Friends,


    Such major tasks are accomplished when the governments work with transparency and sensitivity and when public interests are placed above self-interests. Such major tasks are done when there is a permanent change in the goal system, and permanent and sincere efforts are made with a long term vision.


    Friends,


    Several facilities from the 'seed to the market' are being developed in the country such as the Rice Research Institute of Kashi, the cargo centres set up at Varanasi and Ghazipur, fertilizer factory constructed at Gorakhpur and irrigation projects at Bansagar. I was informed by Manoj ji that the Perishable Cargo Centre at Ghazipur is aiding our green chillies and peas to be sold in the markets of Dubai. Our farmers are now getting better prices for their crops.


    Today everything is being done in a transparent manner to double the income of the farmers. Work is being done with pure diligence to ensure that farmers make maximum profit at a minimum cost.


    Brothers and sisters,


    We can see how the politics of appeasement is being played to garner votes in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. As soon as the government changed there, sinuous queues and lathi charges for fertilizers and urea have once again become a reality. Black marketers have again started appearing to the foreground. Lakhs of farmers were promised loan waivers in Karnataka.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Try to understand this fact. In Karnataka, Congress recently formed its government through the backdoor and promised loan waivers to the farmers. It handed over lollipops to them. Lakhs of farmers were supposed to get loan waivers but how many of them received it? Shall I tell you? How many farmers benefitted? Shall I tell you? You will be surprised! Lakhs of farmers were supposed to receive loan waivers and their votes were stolen. They formed the government by bluffing the people and to how many farmers did they provide loan waivers? Only...only...onlyâ€¦ 800 people!


    You tell me, what kind of promises are these? What kind of a game did they play? Try to understand brothers and sisters, how they have bluffed the farmers! And now the police is after those whose loans were not waivedâ€¦ compelling them to return the loan amount.


    Friends,


    The decisions and the promises made to gain instant political brownie points can never bring permanent solutions to the problems plaguing the country.


    You all are a witness to whatever happened prior to the 2009 elections. Before the 2009 elections, a similar 'lollipop of fake promises' was made. The farmers across the country were promised of similar loan waivers. I want to ask the farmers present here today - whether your loans were waived 10 years back in 2009 or not? Did you receive any money or financial assistance? This promise was made or not? The government was formed or not? Did they forget you after that? Would you trust such people? Would you trust such a company of lollipops? Would you trust such liars? Would you trust such people who deceive the public?


    Brothers and sisters,


    You will be surprised to know that at that time the farmers across the country had a debt of Rs.6 lakhs crores. However, you all know the amount of loans actually waived. A debt of Rs.6 lakh crores and after getting elected, the drama that had unfolded! The statistics speak for itself, how the farmers were deceived! Do you know the loan amount that was waived out of Rs.6 lakh crores? Should I tell you? You will remember how these people had made 'lollipop of fake promises'! Out of the Rs.6 lakh crores of debt, only Rs.60 thousand crores was waived. Rs.6 lakh crores on one hand and Rs.60 thousand crores on the other! Moreover, according to the CAG report, it was found that out of that amount Rs.35 lakhs, such a huge sum, was not received neither for the farmers nor for waiving off loans. The amount went into the pockets of these people. Wasn't your money wasted? Wasn't it a theft? Even out of those whose loans were waived, there were lakhs of people who didn't receive certificates. As a result, interest continued adding to the loan amount and the poor farmer had to pay the loan with an extra interest. These people have committed this sin!


    Brothers and sisters,


    Those people are now unable to take another loan. They took to alcohol. They had to go to private money lenders and had to take loans at high interest rates.


    Friends,


    Who had benefitted out of the loan waivers? At least the farmers did not. Therefore, I request you all to be wary of Congress's lies and treachery. Remember, that the Congress government did not implement the recommendations of the Swaminathan commission. The Congress was sitting on that file for years which recommended setting the MSP to 1.5 times of the cost of the farmers. Had the Congress, 11 years ago, accepted and implemented the Swaminathan Commission recommendations and had they fixed the MSP at 1.5 times the cost of the farmer's produce, today our farmers wouldn't have been indebted. They wouldn't have required loans. But it was your sin that you kept the file suppressed and didn't raise the MSP. The farmer was ruined! He was indebted! This is a result of your sins. The BJP government had pulled out this file and the MSPs of 22 crops were fixed to 1.5 times the cost.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Several such tasks are being done for the past four years. Even the small farmers have now been connected to the banks by our government. New infrastructure and facilities are being developed in Mandis. Mandis are now being developed with the help of modern technology. Cold storage and a chain of mega food parks are also being developed.


    Friends,


    This very government is developing the necessary infrastructure required for crops of farmers as well as for industries. For better connectivity in Purvanchal, many projects have already been completed in the last four and a half years and many others will be completed in the future. The work on the Purvanchal Expressway is progressing at a rapid pace.


    The last time when I had visited Ghazipur, the foundation stone of Tarighat Ghazipur Rail Road Bridge was laid. I was told that very soon this too would be operational. This would open up an alternate route for the people of Purvanchal to visit Delhi and Howra.


    Friends,


    In the last four and a half years, several crucial projects related to railways have been completed in Eastern Uttar Pradesh. Stations are modernized and double-lining and electrification of the railway lines are going on. Several new trains have been started. When the various projects such as the village roads, the National Highways and the Purvanchal Expressway are completed the entire scenario of this region will be transformed. Ghazipur will definitely benefit out of the recently started waterway between Varanasi and Kolkata. The foundation stone of the Jetty to be constructed here has also been laid. With all these facilities in place, this region will become a hub of trade and business. New businesses will come up and the youth will get new employment opportunities.


    Friends,


    We are taking steps towards this resolution of Swaraj. The schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Ujjwala Yojna, Ayushman Bharat Yojana, MUDRA Yojana and Saubhagya Yojana are not just schemes but a medium of empowerment. These are important dimensions of the 5 streams of development-education for children, income for the youth, medicines for the elderly, irrigation for the farmers and addressing people's grievances.


    Brothers and sisters,


    The future is yours, of your children and of the younger generation. This watchman is honestly and passionately working day in and day out to shape your children's future. I hope your faith and blessings remain on me as it is because of this watchman that some of the thieves are unable to sleep peacefully. Your faith and blessings on me will one day take these thieves to their right place.


    Once again I congratulate you all for the new Medical College and saluting the great contributions of Maharaja Suheldev I end my speech. The year 2019 will begin after two days. My best wishes to you all for the New Year.


    Victory to Mother India! Victory to Mother India!
