    Step Taken for improved Safety of Mine workers:

      * Under the provisions of the Mines Act 1952, Permissions, exemptions, relaxations and approvals etc.; were earlier being issued on submission of offline applications by the stakeholders. In view of the Digital India initiative, three software modules namely “Approval System”, “Permission/ Exemption/Relaxation System” and “National Safety Award (Mines) System” have been developed and made live. Two more softwares namely “Accidents & Statistics System” and “Accounts & Budget System” have been developed as a part of “Digital DGMS”. They are under testing. The software modules will bring in more transparency & accountability and speedy disposal of works.
      * The modalities for “Risk-based Inspection System” for coal mines have been developed. The software for the purpose has been developed by NIC and implemented by incorporating it in Shram Suvidha Portal. Risk-based inspection system for metalliferous mines is under progress and shall be developed during 2018-19. The inspections will be generated for online assignment through shram suvidha portal prioritizing on the actual risk rating of the mines of all categories.
      * Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS) has facilitated Risk Assessment Study & preparation of Safety Management Plan in 110 Mines. The system has resulted in more proactive system of safety management.
      * Under a joint project with National Institute of Miners’ Health (NIMH) Nagpur on “Multi-Centric Study of Dust Related Disease in Stone Mines and Development of Sustainable Preventive Programme”, field studies were successfully conducted in Nalgonda district of Telengana and Karauli, Dholpur, Jodhpur, Nagaur and Bharatpur districts of Rajasthan, Vidisha district in MP and Birbhum district in WB. 2539 workers have been medically examined and 136 cases of silicosis affected persons were identified.

The objective of Fixed Term Employment on one hand is to provide flexibility to the employers in order to meet the challenges of globalization, new practices and methods of doing businesses while on the other, this would be beneficial for workers as it gives the 'FTE Workman' the same statutory benefits as that of regular workers in a proportionate manner. This would also substantially decrease exploitation of contract workers as the employer would directly hire the worker without any mediator in the form of contract for a fixed term.


    II. Major Steps Taken by EPFO:

      * In February 2018, an online functionality for filing nomination (Form 2) to the members at Member interface of Unified Portal was provided.

      * In order to facilitate the employers, the requirement of submission of hard copy of Form 5A has been replaced by online submission of Form 5A by establishments with digital/e- signatures by employers. As on 10.10.2018, 5,873 employers have used this facility.

      * In order to ensure that the employers, especially contractors, pay contribution towards provident fund for the full working period of an employee and not on very low unrealistic wages, a tool for monitoring the above issues, namely, wage analysis report, has been provided in Central Analysis & Intelligence Unit (CAIU) dashboard. Through this tool, field functionaries can see the analysis of wages for establishments in respect of their Zones / Regional Offices and ensure that, wherever required, the verification of details furnished by employers in monthly returns (ECR) is done so that there is correct reporting and full compliance in respect of individual employees.
      * The rate of administrative charges were reduced from 0.65% to 0.50% of the pay towards EPF Scheme 1952 subject to minimum sum of seventy –five rupees per month for every non-functional establishment having no contributory member and five hundred rupees per month per establishment for other establishments.
      * A new functionality has been introduced to rectify cases of rejection of Digital Life Certificates (DLCs) due to incorrect Aadhaar number seeded against PPOs. This functionality is aimed to reduce grievances of pensioners and provide hassle free services to them.
      * A new functionality for rejection of erroneously processed intra - office transfer claims and reprocessing the claims with correct details was started on 05.10.2018 to streamline the process of claim settlement and ensure better delivery of services to subscribers.
