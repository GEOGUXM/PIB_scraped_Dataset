    The President of India Shri Ram Nath Kovind said that, “togetherness is the essence of yoga. It not only helps us in connecting body, mind and soul but it also plays an important role in connecting different communities and countries.” He was speaking at the inaugural ceremony of centennial celebrations of ‘The Yoga Institute’ in Mumbai today.


    He further said that it is not appropriate to link yoga to any religion or sect. It is a common heritage of mankind. It belongs to everyone who is looking forward to healthy life. A healthy person makes a healthy family, healthy community, healthy country and finally a healthy world.


    The President also said that it is our responsibility to establish good yoga institutes and skilled yoga teachers as on India’s initiative yoga is getting more popular across the globe.


    On the occasion Governor of Maharashtra released a book ‘Yoga for All’ written by director of the institute, Hansaji Jayadeva Yogendra. The book is based on hundred years of research by The Yoga Institute.


    Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, Union minister of state for AYUSH Shripad Naik and other dignitaries were present at the function.
