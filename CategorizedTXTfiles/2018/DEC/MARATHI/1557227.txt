    Nabendu Ghosh shared a unique bonding with his film-guru, Bimal Roy.


    In 1951, when the celluloid master went to Bombay to make 'Maa' for Bombay Talkies, he took the Bengali litterateur turned screen writer in his team. And in 1964 the director's last film Bandini, that won a silver trophy at Karlovy Vary, was scripted by screen playwright Nabendu Ghosh. In between they had created such timeless classics as Baap-Beti, Parineeta, Naukri, Biraj-Bahu, Devdas, Yahudi and Sujata.


    How did the writer-director duo work? And what made their unique association work? 'And They Made Classics' goes behind the scenes with an interview with Nabendu Ghosh that was taken by Joy Bimal Roy in 2005, as he prepared to make 'Remembering Bimal Roy'. Ratnottama Sengupta revisits the stories in a Centennial Tribute to Nabendu Ghosh (27 March 1917 - 15 December 2007).
