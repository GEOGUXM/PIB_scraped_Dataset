    INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMMES:


    (i) Measuring performance and ranking States on outcomes in critical sectors


    With emphasis on outcomes, NITI finalized indices to measure incremental annual outcomes in critical social sectors like health, education, water and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).


    The District Hospital Index was developed to measure and monitor the performance of hospitals with a focus on outputs and outcomes. A guidebook was released on World Health Day 2016. Presently, the implementation phase is underway in collaboration with MoHFW and the Indian Statistical Institute is assisting in data analytics.


    NITI Aayog has developed the ‘Healthy States, Progressive India’ Report also known as the ‘Health Index’ in February 2018. The Composite Water Management Index was also launched in June 2018. The ‘School Education Quality Index (SEQI)’, ‘SDG India Index’ and the ‘Digital Transformation Index’ (DTI) which will measure states’ progress in respective sectors are in the works.


    (ii) Sustainable Action for Transforming Human Capital (SATH)


    SATH is aimed at initiating transformation in two key social sectors—education and health, by hand-holding States towards improving their social sector indicators and providing technical support over three years. It was launched with selection of states through an unique challenge method. Roadmaps for State transformation have been finalised with quarterly milestones for each initiative.


    A major school consolidation and integration programme has been initiated with over 26,000 schools merged for better efficiencies and utilisation of resources. Uttar Pradesh, Assam, and Karnataka were selected to improve their healthcare delivery and key health indicators. In education, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Jharkhand were selected.


    (iii) Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat


    EBSB was conceptualized to make our country united, strong and promote excellence in all walks of life by means of long-term inter-state engagements through cultural exchanges and education. MoUs were entered with six paired States/UTs. Dept. of Higher Education, MHRD continued the initiative.


    Towards further integration, 100 commonly used conversational sentences throughout India were identified, translated into 22 Indian languages, compiled in a form of book and widely disseminated.


    ( iv) Development Support Services to States (DSSS) for Development of Infrastructure


    To establish a Centre-State partnership model and reignite and establish Private Public Partnership across infrastructure sectors, DSSS was launched to de-risk projects and address key structural issues in project development and build institutional and organizational capacities.


    Over 450 projects from 20 States were received, out of which 10 projects from 8 States in 10 sectors were shortlisted using the challenge method, for structuring and implementation.


    (v) Public-Private Partnership in Health


    To help States achieve the health goals of the government in the area of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of select Non-Communicable processes, viz. Cardiac Sciences, Oncology and Pulmonary Sciences, a guiding framework was developed for States, for implementation at the district hospital level, focusing on tier II/ tier III cities and by engaging services of private/voluntary sector providers.


    A model concessionaire agreement was also launched in October 2018 along with the guidelines for promoting PPP in Healthcare.


    (vi) Resolution of pending issues of States with Central Ministries


    All pending issues with the Central Ministries from all States and UTs have been expeditiously resolved. Issues received from the States of Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha and Puducherry have since been resolved.


    (vii) State Human Development Report


    The State of Maharashtra, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Karnataka, Nagaland, Bundelkhand region and Delhi were supported in the preparation of State Human Development Reports.


    (viii) Transforming of 115 identified Aspirational Districts


    To realise the vision of ‘ SabkaSaath, SabkaVikas’ , and ensure that India’s growth process remains inclusive, the ‘Aspirational District Programme (ADP)’ was launched by the Prime Minister on January 5, 2018. It is a special initiative to rapidly transform 115 identified districts that have shown relatively lesser progress in key social areas and have emerged as pockets of under-development, thereby posing a challenge to ensure balanced regional development.


    Under ADP, 49 key performance indicators (KPIs) have been identified across such sectors with the aim to improving ease of living, as well as enhancing the economic productivity of citizens residing in these districts. Health and nutrition, education, agriculture and water resources, financial inclusion and skill development and basic infrastructure are main sectors where rapid transformation is envisaged.


    On April 1, 2018, NITI Aayog released the baseline ranking of these districts from which the districts can ascertain their status in these sectors, and work to becoming the best district in the State and eventually the best in the country. To realise this vision, district teams have finalised district action plans, following the principle of convergence of efforts of the State and Central government. In addition, the ADP offers a unique platform for different segments of population as well as institutions like civil service organisations, private sector foundations, philanthropies etc.to come together and work with the State and central government to contribute to this important initiative of inclusive development.


    An Aspirational Districts Dashboard has been developed, called ‘Champions of Change’, which captures real-time data and ranking across all indicators. The District Collectors/ Magistrates are providing self-reported data through this dashboard to capture progress.

    INSTITUIONALISE PROJECT MONITORING TO IMPROVE IMPLEMENTATON AND EFFICACY OF GOVERNMENT SCHEMES


    (i) Output Outcome Monitoring Framework 2018-19:


    Given the increased focus on outcome-based monitoring, DMEO initiated an exercise to develop well-defined output and outcomes, along with measurable indicators, for all CS and CSS outlays.


    The activity started by identifying all the relevant outlays, the number coming to around 600 CS/CSS outlays, covering a budget of about Rs. 8.14 lakh crore for the financial year 2017-18. These outputs, outcomes, and indicators were developed using a standardized process, which was based on international best practices in performance monitoring.


    The resultant Output Outcome Monitoring Framework 2018-19 is going to be monitored through a newly developed web-based interactive dashboard. Ministries/Departments have been given access to the dashboard to upload achievement data. Work is in progress to enable the dashboard to automatically fetch performance data from the MIS of Ministries, expenditure details from PFMS, and to also have granular information i.e. State and District level data. Screenshots of the dashboard are given below.


    (ii) Sectoral Reviews by PMO:


    As the Government moves towards realising the outcomes of a scheme or a sector, rather than just outputs, outcomes of 15 sectors are being monitored. While the reviews had been on-going for several years, in the last two years, they’ve moved from tracking physical progress to outcome progress. To facilitate this, an interactive dashboard was developed in 2016. For the 2017 PMO reviews, the sectors covered included Road, Railways, Airports, Ports, Digital India, Coal PNG, Power, NRE, Urban Housing, Rural Housing, and PMGSY. The screenshot of the dashboard is given below.


    (iii) Outcome Budget

    (iv) Programme Monitoring and Evaluation


    DMEO has, based on specific requests, undertaken monitoring and evaluation (M&E) for specific schemes. Following the paradigm shift from outlays to outcome-based governance, efforts have focussed on identifying expected outcomes, measuring progress on the same correctly, and analysing the bottlenecks in their achievement.


    In this regard, a web-based interactive dashboard has been developed by DMEO to monitor the progress of houses being sanctioned and constructed under the Pradhan MantriAawasYojana (Rural and Urban). Screenshots of the dashboard are given below.


    Additionally, evaluation of selected programmes that are currently being implemented has also been taken up, along with quick assessment studies in order to identify gaps in scheme implementation.


    A quick assessment study was carried out for eNAM and submitted to PMO. Evaluation studies and quick assessment studies being finalized are: Prime Minister Employment Generation Programme, National Scheduled Caste Finance Development Corporation, RTE: Harmonized SarvSikshaAbhiyaan, PMAY (Urban), MGNREGA, Pradhan MantriKaushalVikasYojana, Swachh Bharat (Gramin), Pradhan MantriKrishiSinchayeeYojana (Integrated Watershed Management), Pradhan MantriFasalBimaYojana, BharatNet, and Pradhan Mantri Gram SadakYojana.
