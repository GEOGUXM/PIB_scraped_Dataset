    Kolkata, December 10, 2018.


    The new landing at existing footbridge of Santragachhi station was inaugurated today by one of the senior most passengers, Sri Manindra Sarkar and has been opened for the commuters.


    With a view to avoid crowding of passengers at Foot Over Bridge of Santragachi station, one additional landing of the existing Foot Over Bridge has been constructed at the station on war footing as per instructions of General Manager, South Eastern Railway, Shri P.S. Mishra.


    The work completed in a record time of just one month. The new landing has been constructed at the Kona Expressway side, which is used by maximum number of passengers coming to and from Kolkata.


    Earlier, there was only one & same entry and exit steps for the passengers. Now the newly constructed landing facility will enhance the separate exit and separate entry of the passengers to avoid heavy rush at highly populated Santragachi Station. This landing with fully metalised rust proof structure will help in better dispersal of passengers from Santragachi station.


    Apart from this, the work of one additional Foot Over Bridge at Santragachi Station is going on in full swing and is targeted to be commissioned by January 31, 2019.
