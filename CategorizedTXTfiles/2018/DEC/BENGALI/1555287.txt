    08 December 2018, Kolkata.


    December 16 is celebrated as Vijay Diwas to commemorate the victory of the Indian Armed Forces alongwith Mukti-Bahini over Pakistan. This historic military victory resulted in Pakistan ceding control of then East Pakistan thus paving the way for the birth of the sovereign nation of Bangladesh. This day marks the culmination of an epic war unparalleled in history, when India stood against the tide of times and fought for the principles of “Freedom and Equality” that helped millions of Bangladeshis realise their cherished dream of an independent nation. Vijay Diwas epitomizes the resolve of our Nation and the valour of our men in uniform many of whom made the supreme sacrifice in the true traditions of the Armed Forces. This great military achievement would not have been possible without the help and support of the Mukti-Jodhas and the population of Bangladesh who made immense sacrifices and had to bear inhuman deprivation and sufferings during the war.


    Eastern Command has traditionally been celebrating this day as a mark of respect to the fallen heroes of the Indian Armed forces and Mukti-Jodhas who made this victory possible. This day is celebrated as a day of remembrance of those who sacrificed their lives during the 1971 Liberation War of Bangladesh. This year as is the norm a Bangladeshi delegation of 72 members comprising of 30 Mukti Jodhas, 06 serving officers of Bangladesh Armed Forces along with their spouses are participating in the celebrations at Fort William, Kolkata.
