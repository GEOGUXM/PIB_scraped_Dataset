    The Silk Mark Expo 2018, Dibrugarh will be organised from 26 th August to 2 nd September, 2018 in Jyoti Bibah Bhawan, Chowkidingee, Dibrugarh. Silk Mark Organisation of India (SMOI) organises the Silk Mark Expos exclusively involving the Silk Mark members, Authorized Users of the Silk Mark labels, who are weavers, manufacturers, NGOs, prominent silk dealers, exporters and government supported agencies from all over the country.


    These events are ideal platform not only to popularize Silk Mark Labels and provide valuable linkages to all the stake holders in the silk industry, but also to encourage the local entrepreneurs in Silk to start business in Silk.


    It may be mentioned that there are more than 3818 Authorised Users (AUs) of Silk Mark and over 3 lakh Silk Mark labelled products in the market. These labels are not only a mark of purity but also inspire confidence in the buyers to purchase only the silk mark labelled products while buying silk. These in turn increase the demand for pure silks benefitting the sericulture farmers and other stake holders involved in silk.


    In Guwahati, the expo will be held from 5 th September to 9 th September, 2018 at NEDFI House. It will be inaugurated by Shri Ranjit Dutta, Minister of Handloom, Textiles and Sericulture, Government of Assam.
