The Prime Minster has said, “Today, the country is moving ahead celebrating the festival of honesty. Till 2013, i.e. for the last 70 years, there were 4 crore people who were paying direct taxes. However, today this figure has increased to above 6 crore. This is an example that nation is treading the path of honesty”.


    It is to be mentioned that during the Financial Year 2017-18, a record number of 6.92 crore Income Tax returns were filed. This was 1.31 crore more than 5.61 crore returns filed in 2016-17.

He said that to achieve these objectives Aaykar Seva Kendras have already been opened at 22 out of 29 stations in NER. New offices are being opened in far-flung areas to deliver tax payer services such as registration and delivery of PAN, TAN and for ease of filing tax returns, he added.


    The conference, being hosted by Guwahati after a gap of five years, is being attended by more than 60 senior officers of Income-Tax Department of the eastern zone.
