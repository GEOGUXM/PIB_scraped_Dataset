    The Union Minister of Rural Development had requested all the Members of Parliament to identify Gram Panchayats under SAGY. Reminders in this regard were also issued. The newly elected MPs were also requested to identify Gram Panchayats under SAGY. Further, the Minister of Rural Development has written to all the Chief Ministers requesting their attention for ensuring effective implementation of SAGY. The following initiatives have been inter alia taken for better implementation of the Scheme:


      * The guidelines of as many as 22 Central Schemes have been amended or enabled to accord priority for the SAGY Gram Panchayats. A compilation of 223 Central Sector/ Centrally Sponsored and 1,806 State Schemes for convergence under SAGY for the benefit of Members of Parliament, District and Village level officials has been prepared. Ministry has also published a document named ‘SAHYOG’ as an indicative guidance document with the essential information on the existing social security schemes collated from respective Ministries to enrich the knowledge of villagers and village level functionaries to achieve 100% enrollment into the social/ financial Security Schemes in SAGY Gram Panchayats.

      * Developed a 35 point outcome indicator covering basic amenities, education, health, sanitation, livelihood, women empowerment, financial inclusion, food security, social security and e-governance to gauge the impact of SAGY in the Gram Panchayats.

      * Coordinated with other Central Ministries/ Departments for ensuring provision of four key basic services viz. power, drinking water, roads and education in all SAGY Gram Panchayats.


      * Recognising that the implementation of SAGY requires highly motivated and knowledgeable personnel, the Ministry organised capacity building exercises for 373 SAGY functionaries from the Phase-II/III Gram Panchayats during April-June 2018.


      * The Ministry has circulated suggestive template to state governments for preparing proposals for tapping support from Private, Voluntary and Cooperative (PVC) sectors. The proposals received from States/UTs have been displayed on the SAGY website for wider circulation. Further, Ministry has met with the representatives of Industry and Professional Associations linked with Ministry of Corporate Affairs and oriented them on the opportunities presented by SAGY, Mission Antyodaya and other schemes for converging private / corporate investments with the government initiatives for the development of villages.
