    Union Minister for Environment, Forest &Climate Change, Science & Technology and Earth Science, Dr Harsh Vardhan has expressed grief over the death of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. “There is nothing as devastating as the news of the demise of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who inspired millions of Indians. There was none like Atal Bihari Vajpayee in Indian political landscape and there would not be one. A visionary statesman, with political sagacity, his acceptability across diverse ideological spectrum endeared him to all ,” Dr. Vardhan said in a condolence message, here today.


    The minister said that the Indian scientific community owes it to Vajpayee ji for bringing Science to the forefront of national priorities. The former Prime Minister expanded Lal Bahadur Shastri’s slogan “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan” to include “Jai Vigyan” after the nuclear test at Pokhran.


    In the passing away of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, I have lost a mentor and guide, who hand-held me to politics, Dr Harsh Vardhan said.
