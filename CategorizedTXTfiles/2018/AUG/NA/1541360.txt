    An Expert Committee constituted by the University Grants Commission (UGC) had identified 374 Educationally Backward Districts (EBDs) where Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education was less than the national average of 12.4% based on 2001 census data.


    During the first phase of the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA), being implemented by the Ministry of Human Resource Development with the aim of promoting access, equity and quality , central assistance to States has been provided for creation of one Model Degree College each in 60 EBDs.


    NITI Aayog has identified 117 districts as ‘Aspirational Districts’. The districts have been selected on the basis of composite index which includes published data of deprivation enumerated under Socio-Economic Caste Census, Health &Nutrition, Education and Basic Infrastructure.


    During the second phase of RUSA, the focus is on opening new Model Degree Colleges in ‘Aspirational Districts’ identified by NITI Aayog and in unserved & underserved districts in North Eastern and Himalayan States.
