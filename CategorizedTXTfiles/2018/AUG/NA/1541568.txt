    As reported by Public Sector Banks (PSBs), the average time taken to process loan applications ranges from 15 to 30 days on receipt of completed application form.


    As reported by NSDL, 22119 applications are pending as on 29.07.2018 for more than 6 months. Major reasons for pendency of application include application being non-compliant under IBA Education loan scheme and/or students not submitting desired information, lack of proper response from students to the queries raised by banks. Depending on the reason for pendency of applications, banks take necessary action for its effective disposal. The students are contacted by the banks for early submission of required documents.
