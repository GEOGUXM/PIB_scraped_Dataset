    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, witnessed the special screening of a documentary on the President’s Bodyguard (PBG) today (August 14, 2018) at Rashtrapati Bhavan.


    The documentary produced by National Geographic has been directed by Shri Robin Roy, with narration by Shri Amitabh Bachchan. It will premiere on National Geographic Channel on August 15, 2018 at 2100 hrs.


    The documentary tells the story of the President’s Bodyguard, the oldest surviving mounted unit and one of the senior most regiments of the Indian Army. The regiment, which a 245 year legacy, is made up of almost 200 soldiers and represents supreme and selfless service.


    In his interview as part of the documentary, the President has said, “The President’s Bodyguard displays the best traditions of discipline and skills of our Armed Forces. Their flawless turn-out and impressive bearing speak for the heritage of our country, and our Armed Forces. But behind their skills, while standing erect or on horse-back, is years of hard work and the relentless pursuit of perfection. These are untiring, dedicated and brave soldiers – as good as the best in the world. I am very proud of them.”
