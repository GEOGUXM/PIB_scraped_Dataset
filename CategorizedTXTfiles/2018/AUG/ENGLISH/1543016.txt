    Sergeant Shashidhar P Prasad Indian Air Force (Garud) was deployed in Op Rakshak. On receipt of specific intelligence at 1600 h on 10 Oct 17, about presence of terrorists hiding in a house, an operation was launched jointly by Garud team and Army Units in Boon Mohalla of village Rakh Hajin, district Bandipora in Jammu & Kashmir. Garud team was assigned the responsibility to establish innermost cordon around the target house to prevent escape of terrorists. Sgt Shashidhar demonstrated exceptional situational awareness and team work in establishing a cordon that blocked the likely escape route of terrorists. At 0440 h on 11 Oct 17, with the intention to break the cordon and escape, six to seven terrorists came out of the house firing Under Barrel Grenade Launcher, throwing hand grenades and firing bullets indiscriminately on the cordon laid by Garud team. Having sensed the intentions of fleeing terrorists, Sgt Shashidhar demonstrated indomitable courage and high degree of expertise in weapon skills by exercising effective and accurate fire on the terrorists thereby, resulting in shooting down of two category 'A' terrorists. Sgt Shashidhar disregarded his personal safety, exhibited admirable team work and ensured speedy evacuation of the injured men in the intensely fought close quarter battle.


    For this act of exceptional courage, Sgt Shashidhar P Prasad is awarded Vayu Sena Medal (Gallantry).
