      A group of State Civil Service Officers promoted to the IAS and attending the 120 th Induction Training Programme at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind today (August 3, 2018) at Rashtrapati Bhavan.


      Addressing the Civil Service Officers, the President said that the All India Services have played a significant role in the development of the country and the growth of our economy. No one can doubt the contribution of these services to nation building. But we must critique ourselves to ensure that our Civil Services constantly improve.


      The President said that as public servants, the Civil Service Officers need to be role models in their personal conduct. In their professional conduct, honesty and integrity, humility, and sensitivity to the diversity of India and of our society are non-negotiable.


      The President said that all the officers work in the service of the people of India. However some people need government support more than others. The Civil Service Officers have to focus their energies to serve those among our fellow citizens who are economically weak, socially disadvantaged and politically under-empowered. It is these groups that need their attention the most.
