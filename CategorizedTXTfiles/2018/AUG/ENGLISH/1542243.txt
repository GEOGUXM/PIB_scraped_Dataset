    India is recognized globally as a nation with advanced nuclear technologies. India has developed comprehensive capabilities in all aspects of nuclear power viz. Siting, Design, Construction, Commissioning, Operation & Maintenance and waste management of nuclear power plants.


    Presently, nuclear power plants are set up in cooperation with Russian Federation in the country. Two power plants viz. Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project (KKNPP) 1&2 are already commercially operating. Inter Governmental Agreement (IGA) for co-operation in peaceful uses of nuclear energy have been signed with 17 countries.


    Our atomic energy policy strengthenes our relations with foreign countries.
