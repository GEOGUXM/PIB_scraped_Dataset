    Tribal Sub Plan (TSP), now called Scheduled Tribe Component (STC) Strategy was adopted for accelerated development of tribal people. It envisages channelizing the flow of outlays & benefits from all sectors of development to ST population. STC is a multi-pronged strategy which includes support for education, health, sanitation, water supply, livelihood etc. Major part of infrastructure development in tribal dominated areas and provision of basic amenities to tribal people in the country is carried out through various schemes / programmes of concerned Central Ministries and the State Governments concerned, while the Ministry of Tribal Affairs provides additive to these initiatives by way of plugging gaps.


    Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) has issued revised norms on 26.12.2017 for allocation of STC by Central Ministries / Departments. As per Union Budget 2018-19, there are 37 Central Ministries and Departments having STC funds catering to specific tribal development in various sectors through 299 different schemes.


    So far as State TSP is concerned, as per extant Guidelines, State Governments are to allocate funds under TSP out of total Plan/Scheme Outlays not less than the population proportion of STs in State as per 2011 Census.


    This information was given by the Union Minister of State for Tribal Affairs Shri. Jaswantsinh Bhabhor in Rajya Sabha today .
