    Soil Health Card Scheme plays a vital role in enhancing agricultural production in a sustainable manner. The Government has introduced Soil Health Card (SHC) Scheme to assist State Governments to provide Soil Health Cards to all farmers across the country once in a cycle of 2 years. Soil Health Cards provides information to farmers on nutrient status of their soil along with recommendations on appropriate dosage of nutrients to be applied for improving soil health and its fertility, which results in enhanced agricultural productivity.


    National Productivity Council (NPC) in their study, has reported savings of 8-10% of fertilizers and 5-6% increase in crop yield, as a result of fertilizer application as per the recommendations of Soil Health Cards.


    This Information was given by the Minister of State for Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Shri Parshottam Rupala
