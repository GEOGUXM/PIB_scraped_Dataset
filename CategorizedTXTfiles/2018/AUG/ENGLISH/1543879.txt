    The Stores, Proactive, Efficient and Expeditious Despatch of Extra Size/ Wt Consignment (SPEEDEX) contract was formally launched today by Air Marshal RKS Shera, Air Officer-in-charge Maintenance in the presence of senior IAF officers, MoD dignitaries and CEOs of the companies.


    The contract with acronym ‘SPEEDEX’ has been concluded on 28 Jun 18 with M/s Balmer Lawrie & Co Ltd and M/s Ashok Travel and Tours for the Air & Surface component respectively. The ability to ‘lift, shift and move’ is the essence of sound transportation management and it has a profound impact on all principles of Military Logistics. In the past, IAF had been using hired transport for movement of cargo to various IAF bases, which resulted in delay in dispatch of critically required stores. Therefore, a need was felt to reduce the time taken for transportation of items and ensure early availability of stores to the field units.


    Aim of the contract is to overcome the delay in piecemeal dispatch of consignment and to move operationally urgent stores by air and normal consignments by surface mode. This would include door to door pickup and delivery facility with fixed timelines, lesser than Speed Post. This contract will enhance support to IAF maintenance activities and improve operational preparedness.
