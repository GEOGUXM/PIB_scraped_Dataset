      Posted On: 01 AUG 2018 3:09PM by PIB Delhi


    ISRO is working on Electric Propulsion System (EPS) which can reduce the dependence on chemical propellant. The EPS system was first flown on South Asia Satellite (SAS) â€“ GSAT-9 launched in the year 2017 and is working satisfactory.


    With the help of EPS, satellite weight can be reduced as the chemical propellants are replaced by electrical system, the weight of which is not so significant compared to chemical propellant.


    A 4 tonne satellite with EPS can do the work of 6 tonne satellite with the same efficiency. In addition, it will also have few extra years of life compared to chemical propulsion.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, DrJitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
