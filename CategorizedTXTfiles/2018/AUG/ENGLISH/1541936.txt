      Review Committees by States on TB
      Posted On: 07 AUG 2018 4:58PM by PIB Delhi


    After the Prime Ministerâ€™s letter to Chief Ministers on TB, several States/UTs have established review committees under the Chairmanship of Health Minister or Secretary (Health) at the State level. Similarly, the States/UTs have also established review committees under the District Collectors / Magistrates at the district level. The State level reviews are conducted quarterly, and the District level reviews are conducted monthly.


    The Central Government is regularly monitoring the State Governments on implementation of the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) and has guided the States to establish State / District level forums involving all stakeholders for ensuring a holistic approach and community led response towards addressing the problem related to Tuberculosis


    These State / District level reviews track progress on key priorities and help the State and District to improve performance on newer initiatives undertaken by RNTCP like Daily Regimen, Universal Drug Susceptibility testing, active TB case finding in vulnerable groups, molecular diagnostics expansion, Bedaquiline based drug resistant TB treatment expansion, incentives under Nikshay Poshan Yojana for nutritional support, etc.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
