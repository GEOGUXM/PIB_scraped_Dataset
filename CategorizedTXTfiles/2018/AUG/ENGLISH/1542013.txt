    The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has expressed deep sorrow over the demise of Shri M. Karunanidhi.


    Following is the text of Vice President’s message :


    “I am grieved by the passing away of Shri M. Karunanidhi, one of the leading and longstanding politicians of our country who left a mark of his own during his long public life of about 80 years including 56 years as Member of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly.


    He was a multifaceted personality and a gritty fighter and had overcome several challenges during his long stint in public life. Being a member of the State Legislative Assembly 13 times since 1957 from seven different constituencies and Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for five times speaks for his deep connect with and influence over the people of the State.


    Besides being a renowned script writer, Shri Karunanidhi played an important role in scripting the growth and development of State of Tamil Nadu which in turn catalysed that of the country. Despite heading a regional party, he played a constructive role in national politics.


    I had a long acquintence with Shri Karunanidhi, he is a great orator, writer, administrator of our times.


    In the demise of Shri Karunanidhi, the country lost a man of letters and able administrator and a reformer.


    I deeply mourn passing away Shri Karunanidhi and offer my sincere condolences to the members of the grieved family.”
