    Grant-in-aid to Voluntary Organisations working for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes: The prime objective of the scheme is to enhance the reach of welfare schemes of Government and fill the gaps in service deficient tribal areas, in the sectors such as education, health, drinking water, agro-horticultural productivity, social security etc. through the efforts of voluntary organizations;


    Strengthening Education among Scheduled Tribe (ST) Girls in Low Literacy Districts: The scheme aims to bridge the gap in literacy levels between the general female population and tribal women, through facilitating 100% enrolment of tribal girls in the identified Districts or Blocks, more particularly in naxal affected areas and in areas inhabited by Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), and reducing drop-outs at the elementary level by creating the required ambience for education; and


    Vocational Training in Tribal Areas: The scheme is aimed at upgrading the skills of the tribal youths in various traditional/modern vocations depending upon their educational qualification, present economic trends and the market potential.

Under the scheme of Grant-in-aid to Voluntary Organisations working for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes, extent of assistance is 100% for those projects being implemented in the Scheduled Areas.
