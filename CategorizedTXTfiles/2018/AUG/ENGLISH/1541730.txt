      Employment Guarantee Scheme
      Posted On: 06 AUG 2018 4:15PM by PIB Delhi


    Employment generation coupled with improving employability is the priority concern of the Government. Ministry of Rural Development has been implementing ‘The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), 2005’ which provides at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. The demand for work itself is influenced by various factors such as rain-fall pattern, availability of alternative and remunerative employment opportunities outside MGNREGA and prevailing unskilled wage rates.


    Further, Government runs various employment generation schemes for beneficiaries like Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) implemented by Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGA), Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) scheme run by Ministry of Rural Development, and Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM) implemented by Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs. Details of the progress of the schemes are as follows:
