    India is the 3rd largest energy consumer in the world. Its energy consumption is expected to grow by 4.2% p.a. which is faster than all major economies. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India is expected to account for almost one-third of the global growth in energy demand by 2040.


    To maintain the thrust on economic growth, it is imperative that the country’s Oil & Gas sector grows consistently so as to enable energy security and accessibility to its people.


    Policy reforms in this sector:
