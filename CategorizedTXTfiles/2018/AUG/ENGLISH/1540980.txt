      Posted On: 01 AUG 2018 1:53PM by PIB Delhi


    In pursuance of the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission and given the rise in the pay over the year, the Government has decided to discontinue Overtime Allowance (OTA) for categories other than operational staff and industrial employees who are governed by the statutory provisions. Each Ministry/Department is mandated to prepare the list of “operational staff” in accordance with a common definition as incorporated in the Office Memorandum dated 19.6.2018 (copy enclosed as Annexure). The rate of OTA has not been revised and payment of the same has been linked to biometric attendance.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, DrJitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
