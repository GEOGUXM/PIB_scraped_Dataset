    Government monitors the price situation on a regular basis as price stability is very high on its agenda. Government has taken a number of measures from time to time to control inflation, especially food inflation, which, inter alia, include appropriately utilizing trade and fiscal policy instruments like import and export duty, Minimum Export Price, export restrictions, etc., to regulate domestic availability and moderate prices; imposition of stock limits and advising States for effective action against hoarders and black marketers; and, provision of higher Minimum Support Prices to incentivize farmers for increasing production. Further, Government is also implementing Price Stabilization Fund (PSF) scheme to help moderate the volatility in prices of agri-horticultural commodities like pulses, onion and potato.


    This was stated by Shri Pon Radhakrishnan, Minister of State for Finance in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
