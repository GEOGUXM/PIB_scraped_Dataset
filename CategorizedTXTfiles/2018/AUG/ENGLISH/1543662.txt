    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the 6 th international Buddhist conclave in New Delhi today (August 23, 2018). This conclave is being organised by the Ministry of Tourism, Government of India.


    Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the voyage of Buddhism from India to Asia and the transcontinental links that were created carried more than just spiritualism. They carried a rich cargo of knowledge and learning. They carried arts and crafts. They carried meditation techniques and even martial arts. Eventually, the many roads that the monks and nuns - those men and women of faith - carved out became among the earliest trade routes. In that sense, Buddhism was the basis for an early form of globalisation â€“ and of inter-connectedness in our continent. It is these principles and values that must continue to guide us.


    The President said that tourism is a multi-stakeholder enterprise. The private sector and civil society have substantial roles. And in terms of providing a safe and secure visitor experience, state and municipal administrations play a critical part. The business potential of tourism is immense. Across our world, this industry is a big job creator, especially for local households and local communities. In its essence, tourism, like Buddhism, is about people and empowering them to realise their potential.
