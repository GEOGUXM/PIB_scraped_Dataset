      Coal Transportation Facilities
      Posted On: 03 AUG 2018 4:38PM by PIB Delhi


    Transport facility is not a constraint on coal production. There was an increase of 105 MT in production of Coal India Limited between 2013-14 and 2017-18 compared to an increase of only 31.15 MT in the preceding five years between 2009-10 to 2013-14. However, there are a few mines in Mahandi Coalfields Limited, Central Coalfields Limited and South Eastern Coalfields Limited which are unable to operate at optimal capacity due to coal evacuation constraint.


    The off take of Coal India Limited has increased from 534.20 MT in 2015-16to 581.5 MT during 2017-18. The increase in off take of CIL between 2013-14 and 2017-18 is 109.12 MT as compared to an increase of 55.04 MT between 2009-10 to 2013-14. Annual average rakes provided by Railways to CIL for transportation of coal has increased from 212.8 (rakes/day) in 2015-16 to 229.2 (rakes/day) in 2017-18. Transportation by other modes (MGR, Belt and Rope) by CIL have also increased from 105.52 MT in 2015-16 to110.22 MT in 2017-18. Therefore, there is adequate transportation facility to transport coal to the destination.


    The Projects partially affected due to transport constraint are Kulda and Basundhara (West) Extension of MCL in Odisha, Magadh and Amrapali of CCL in Jharkhand and Chhaland Baroud of SECL in Chhatisgarh. However, high level meeting of the monitoring committee of Ministry of Coal and Railways is held regularly to address the issue of evacuation bottlenecks. A 50.30 Km Jharsuguda-Barpali-Sardega single rail line has been constructed which can despatch 10 to 12 rakes per day.


    With the opening of Tori-Balumathrailline, at least 3 MT additional production in likely to take place from the Magadh-Amarpali area of CCL.


    The following railway infrastructure projects have been taken up for improving coal evacuation in Chattishgarh, Jharkhand and Odisha:

     1. Tori-Shivpur–Kathotia New BG Line (Total length 93.45 Km) in Jharkhand: Tori-BalumathRaillinesection has been inaugurated on 09.03.2018 and currently coal dispatch is going on. Remaining work beyond Balumath is under progress.

    2. Mahanadi Coal Railway Limited (MCRL) PROJECTS: The project consists primarily of 3 components: Angul–Balaram (12.9km), Balaram- Putagadia and Jarapada-Putagadia-Tentuloi ( 55Km ) in Odisha.


    3. Chhattisgarh EastRailway Ltd. (CERL) (Length: 132 Km ): Bhupdeopur-Gharghoda-DharamjaigarhuptoKorbawith a spur from Gharghorato DongaMahuainChhatisgarh.

    This information was given by the Minister of Railways, Coal, Finance & Corporate Affairs, Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
