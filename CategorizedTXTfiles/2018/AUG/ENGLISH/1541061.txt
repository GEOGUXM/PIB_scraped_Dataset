    Indian Railways propose to install bio-toilets in all the passenger carrying coaches by the year 2019.


    Presently, the cost of providing 4 bio-toilets on a coach is ` 4.13 lakh i.e. approximately ` 1.0 lakh per bio-toilet and around 17,500 more passenger carrying coaches are to be provided with bio-toilets.


    To complete the work of installation of bio-toilets in entire coaching fleet within stipulated time frame, following steps are being taken by Indian Railways:


    1. All new coaches, being turned out from coach Production Units of Indian Railways, are fitted with bio-toilets.


    2. Railway workshops have been instructed to retro-fit bio-toilets in all existing in-service eligible coaches undergoing mid-life rehabilitation and periodical overhaul.


    3. Retro-fitment of bio-toilets is also being done in coaching depots.


    This information was given by the Minister of State of Railways, Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
