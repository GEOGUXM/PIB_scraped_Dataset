    Maintenance of law and order and providing safety and security to all citizens is primarily the subject matter of State Governments concerned.


    The framework of existing laws such as Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code etc. is considered adequate to provide for safety and security to all citizens, including RTI activists.


    Government of India has drawn the attention of State Governments to the reports appearing in the media about the victimization of people, who use RTI to expose corruption and irregularities in administration.


    The Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2014 has been notified on 12 th May, 2014. As the Act required amendments aimed at safeguarding against disclosures affecting sovereignty and integrity of India, Security of the State, etc., before it is brought into force, the Government introduced the Whistle Blowers Protective (Amendment) Bill, 2015 in the Lok Sabha which has been passed by the Lok Sabha on 13 th May, 2015. The said Bill has been transmitted to the Rajya Sabha and is presently pending in the Rajya Sabha.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
