     3. placing of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and topic-wise and sector-wise informational brochures on the website,
     4. setting up of GST Seva Kendras in GST field offices to provide assistance to taxpayers and other stakeholders,
     5. extensive use of social media platforms for dissemination of information, broadcast of television commercials,
     6. release of advertisements in newspapers, display of information on hoardings across the country.
