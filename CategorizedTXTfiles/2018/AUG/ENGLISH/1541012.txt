      Posted On: 01 AUG 2018 4:09PM by PIB Delhi


    Two coastal highway projects of 415 km length are planned in the state of Odisha with an investment of about Rs 7500 core. Rs 6000 crore have been earmarked for construction, while a sum of Rs 1500 crore is kept aside for land acquisition. NHAI has already finalised the alignment of these projects last year.


    The 252 km long Gopalpur-Ratanpur stretch via Chatrapur-Satapada-Konark-Astrang-Naugaon–Paradip-Ratanpur is in DPR preparation stage. Preliminary alignment has been approved, and modifications are under discussion. The over 162 km long Ratanpur-Digha stretch via Basudevpur-Chandipur-Chandaneswar is also in DPR preparation stage. After submission of final feasibility report, alignment has been finalised. Both the above projects are to be taken up under Bharatmala.


    Approval from Odisha government is awaited for both the projects.
