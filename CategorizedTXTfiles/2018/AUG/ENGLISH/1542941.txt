The index for ‘Manufacture of Wood and of Products of Wood and Cork’ group declined by 0.8 percent to 132.0 (provisional) from 133.1 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of wooden box/crate (2%) and wooden panel, lamination wooden sheets/veneer sheets and wood cutting, processed/sized (1% each). However, the price of wooden block-compressed or not and timber/wooden plank, sawn/resawn (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Printing and Reproduction of Recorded Media’ group declined by 0.8 percent to 145.3 (provisional) from 146.4 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of printed books (2%) and printed labels/posters/calendars (1%). However, the price of hologram (3d) (2%) and journal/periodical, sticker plastic and printed form & schedule (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Chemicals and Chemical Products’ group rose by 0.1 percent to 118.1 (provisional) from 118.0 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of menthol (17%), fungicide, liquid (7%), hydrogen peroxide (5%), sulphuric acid and carbon black (4% each), shampoo, ammonium sulphate and toilet soap (3% each), organic surface active agent, aromatic chemicals, nitrogenous fertilizer, others, di ammonium phosphate, acrylic fibre, ammonium phosphate, phthalic anhydride, printing ink and adhesive tape (non-medicinal) (2% each) and additive, polyester chips or polyethylene terepthalate (pet) chips, ethyl acetate, organic solvent, amine, superphospate/phosphatic fertilizer, others, detergent cake, washing soap cake/bar/powder, plasticizer, polyester film (metalized), alkyl benzene, other petrochemical intermediates, polystyrene, expandable and ammonia liquid (1% each). However, the price of mosquito coil (10%), nitric acid (5%), caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) and varnish (all types) (4% each), gelatine and paint (2% each) and adhesive excluding gum, camphor, polyethylene, perfume/scent, sodium silicate, insecticide & pesticide, tooth paste/tooth powder, explosive, agro chemical formulation, mono ethyl glycol and alcohols (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Other Non-Metallic Mineral Products’ group rose by 0.4 percent to 115.7 (provisional) from 115.2 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of graphite rod (6%), non ceramic tiles (3%), pozzolana cement (2%) and railway sleeper, ordinary portland cement, marble slab, glass bottle, asbestos corrugated sheet and white cement (1% each). However, the price of porcelain sanitary ware (8%), toughened glass (4%) and ceramic tiles (vitrified tiles), slag cement and plain bricks (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Basic Metals’ group declined by 0.8 percent to 112.1 (provisional) from 113.0 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of steel forgings-rough (7%), stainless steel pencil ingots/billets/slabs (6%), alloy steel castings (4%), MS pencil ingots and stainless steel coils, strips & sheets (3% each), aluminium ingot, mild steel (MS) blooms, brass metal/sheet/coils, MS bright bars and aluminium metal (2% each) and pig iron, stainless steel tubes, aluminium powder, aluminium shapes-bars/rods/flats, alloy steel wire rods, aluminium alloys, angles, channels, sections, steel (coated/not), ferromanganese, silicomanganese, MS castings and cold rolled (CR) coils & sheets, including narrow strip (1% each). However, the price of galvanized iron pipes (3%), rails and ferrochrome (2% each) and alumnium foil, MS wire rods, stainless steel bars & rods, including flats, aluminium disk and circles, lead ingots, bars, blocks, plates, sponge iron/direct reduced iron (DRI) and hot rolled (HR) coils & sheets, including narrow strip (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Fabricated Metal Products, Except Machinery and Equipment’ group rose by 0.5 percent to 114.6 (provisional) from 114.0 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of forged steel rings (5%), hand tools (4%), steel drums and barrels, bracket and steel structures (2% each) and bolts, screws, nuts & nails of iron & steel, steel container and stainless steel tank (1% each). However, the price of sanitary fittings of iron & steel (14%), electrical stamping- laminated or otherwise (4%), steel door (2%) and stainless steel razor (1%) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Computer, Electronic and Optical Products’ group declined by 0.4 percent to 110.9 (provisional) from 111.3 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of colour TV, capacitors and air conditioner (1% each). However, the price of electro-diagnostic apparatus, used in medical, surgical, dental or veterinary sciences and electronic printed circuit board (pcb)/micro circuit (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Electrical Equipment’ group rose by 0.1 percent to 111.7 (provisional) from 111.6 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of ACSR conductors and connector/plug/socket/holder-electric (2% each) and fibre optic cables, light fitting accessories, fan, electric switch, refrigerators, electric switch gear control/starter and electric wires & cables (1% each). However, the price of solenoid valve and aluminium wire (3% each), electric & other meters (2%) and electrical resistors (except heating resistors), insulator, electrical relay/conductor, pvc insulated cable, washing machines/laundry machines and rubber insulated cables (1% each) declined.
