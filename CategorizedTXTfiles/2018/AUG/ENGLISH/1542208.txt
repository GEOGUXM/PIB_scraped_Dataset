      Posted On: 09 AUG 2018 3:47PM by PIB Delhi


    Mapping and inventorying of Kharif rice area in Jharkhand is carried out by Mahalanobis National Crop Forecasting Centre (MNCFC), Ministry of Agriculture and Farmersâ€™ Welfare, using ISRO developed methodology.


    Satellite data is used to assess the Kharif rice area and the post-kharif rice fallow lands in Jharkhand. One of the objectives of Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India (BGREI) scheme is to promote cultivation in post Kharif-rice fallow areas to increase cropping intensity and income of farmers. The Kharif rice area estimate, in 2016-17, was 13.94 Lakh Ha for the state of Jharkhand. Preliminary analysis indicates that about 65-70% of Kharif rice area is left fallow during post kharif season. These are mostly located in the southern districts of the state. About 25-30% of these post kharif rice fallow lands are found to be suitable for cultivation of short duration pulse crops during post kharif season. These are mostly located in the districts of Ranchi, Gumla, Simdega, W. Singhbhum, Giridih, Koderma etc.


    The analysis findings are being provided to the local Government/ Department with locations/ maps where farmers can optimise or maximise the utilisation of resources by taking up another or additional crop during the post kharif fallow period.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
