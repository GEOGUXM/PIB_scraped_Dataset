      Posted On: 07 AUG 2018 3:11PM by PIB Delhi


    The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has not received any input suggesting that the police should be given limited access to Aadhaar data. Chapter VI of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 read with the Aadhaar (Data Security) Regulations, 2016 inter-alia has provisions regarding protection of information to ensure that the information in the possession of control of the Authority, including information stored in the Central Identities Data Repository, is secured and protected against access, use or disclosure not permitted under this Act or regulations made thereunder.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.
