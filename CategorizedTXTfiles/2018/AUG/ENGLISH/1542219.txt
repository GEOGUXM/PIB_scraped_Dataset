    The Central Government provides 27% reservation to Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in the posts of Central Government services and admission in Central Educational Institutions subject to exclusion of socially advanced persons/sections (Creamy Layer).


    The percentage of reservation for OBCs has been determined in pursuance of Supreme Courtâ€™s directions in the Indra Sawhney case [Writ Petition (Civil)] No. 930 of 1990], whereby the ceiling of overall reservation has been prescribed at 50%.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
