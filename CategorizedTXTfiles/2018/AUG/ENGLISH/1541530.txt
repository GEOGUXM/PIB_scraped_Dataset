      MSP for Kharif Crops
      Posted On: 03 AUG 2018 5:09PM by PIB Delhi


    Government announces minimum support prices (MSPs) for 22 mandated crops and fair and remunerative price (FRP) for sugarcane on the basis of recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned and other relevant factors. The mandated crops are 14 crops of the kharif season viz. paddy, jowar, bajra, maize, ragi, arhar, moong, urad, groundnut-in-shell, soyabean, sunflower, sesamum, nigerseed and cotton; 6 rabi crops viz. wheat, barley, gram, masur(lentil), rapeseed/mustard and safflower and two other commercial crops viz. jute and copra. In addition, the MSPs of toria and de-husked coconut are fixed on the basis of the MSPs of rapeseed/mustard and copra, respectively.


    Government has announced its historic decision on 04.07.2018 to fix MSP at a level of at least 150 per cent of the cost of production for kharif crops 2018-19 which redeems the promise made in the Union Budget for 2018-19.The MSPs fixed by Government, cost and returns over all-India weighted average cost of production of crops for 2017-18 and 2018-19 is at Annexure. Cost of production varies in different states on account of difference in levels of irrigation, resource endowment, farm mechanization, land holding size, yield of crops etc.


    From time to time, some farmers and farmersâ€™ organizations have been agitating and making certain demands like increase in Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for agricultural crops and other agricultural policies.


    Recent increase in MSP of Kharif crops at a level of at least 150 per cent of the cost of production will ensure remunerative price to farmers. Government has taken several steps to provide remunerative prices to farmers for their produce which include implementing e-National Agriculture Market and framing model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2017, promoting Farmers Producer Organization (FPO) and stepping up the levels of procurement for pulses and oilseeds through the Price Support Scheme (PSS). PSS is implemented at the request of the state government concerned which agrees to exempt the procured commodities from levy of mandi tax & other state duties. The basic objectives of PSS are to provide remunerative prices to the growers for their produce with a view to encourage higher investment and production and to safeguard the interest of the consumers by making available supplies at reasonable price with low cost of intermediation. Under PSS, payments to the farmers are made strictly through Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)/National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) and account payee cheque by the procuring agencies within three days of purchase of their produce.
