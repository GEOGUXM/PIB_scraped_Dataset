    The matters relating to safety, health and welfare of persons employed in the mines are dealt with under the Mines Act, 1952, Rules and Regulations made there under. DGMS administers the Mines Act, 1952 for ensuring safety in the mines in the country .The owner, agent, manager and other statutory persons appointed at the mines are required to comply with the provisions of the statute. Chief Inspector of Mines and Inspectors of Mines make inspections and enquire whenever it is required to ascertain whether the provisions of the Mines Act 1952 and of the regulations, rules and bye-laws and of any order made thereunder are observed in the case of any mine.


    In order to prevent re-occurrence of accidents in future, Directorate General of Mines Safety issues circular for the mining industry for preventive measures to be taken. To ensure that the mine workers are provided with adequate safety measures while working in the mines, Officers of DGMS undertake inspections of mines and take following measures:

      * Pointing out contraventions
      * Withdrawal of permission
      * Issue of improvement notices
      * Prohibition of employment
      * Informal stoppages
      * Prosecution in the court of law

    To prevent accidents in the mines the following steps are also taken/being taken by the Government:

     1. To promote and propagate safety awareness in mines, National Safety Awards (Mines), National Conference on Safety in Mines are organized by DGMS. The recommendations of National Conference on Safety in Mines go a long way in enhancing safety of mine workers.
     2. Workers participation and sensitization in matters of safety are ensured through training in safety and by initiatives like celebration of safety week and safety campaigns, etc.
     3. Safety training programmes are organized among Managers and Supervisors for improving safety standards in mines.
     4. Introduction of Risk Assessment Techniques and preparation of safety management plan aimed at elimination of risks and to ensure safety of workmen.
     5. Introduction of standard operating procedures to avoid unsafe practices in mines.
     6. Time to time, DGMS Circulars are issued as guidelines for safe operations in identified thrust areas.

    Training the persons employed in the mines is provided as per the provisions of The Mines Vocational Training Rules, 1966(a subordinate legislation of The Mines Act, 1952).The salient points of The Mines Vocational Training Rules, 1966 are:

     1. Provision for training centre as per the provisions of the Rule 18 of The Mines Vocational Training Rules, 1966.
     2. Provisions for Training officer as per Rule 20 of The Mines Vocational Training Rules, 1966.
     3. Provision of trainer as per Rule 22 of The Mines Vocational Training Rules, 1966.
