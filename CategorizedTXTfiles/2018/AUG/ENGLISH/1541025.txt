      Manufacturing of Aircrafts
      Posted On: 01 AUG 2018 4:39PM by PIB Delhi


    In the country, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), is manufacturing aircrafts & helicopters for defence as well as for civil purpose.


    HAL has been doing this task under Transfer of Technology (ToT) from foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) as well as under indigenous development programmes.


    Till now, HAL has manufactured 17 types of indigenous aircrafts and helicopters.


    Following steps have been taken to enhance indigenous defence/ civil manufacturing capabilities;

      * Under ‘Make in India’, 56 x Avro replacement aircraft has been undertaken with involvement of private sector where, foreign vendors have been cleared to choose an Indian Production Agency (IPA) for indigenous manufacturing of aircraft.
      * A Strategic Partnership model has also been introduced in Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP -2016) to manufacture four platforms including fighter aircraft & helicopters.
      * In order to promote HAL-made Dornier (Do-228) aircraft for civil operation, HAL has obtained Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) certification.

    Manufacturing of aircraft involves variety of components / engines / mechanical & hydraulic systems / accessories / avionics etc, which require a robust supply chain. Some of the components being proprietary items from foreign OEM, necessitate import of the same. Further, for the use of latest and high-end technologies / strategic importance / techno-economic considerations, some components are imported.


    In last three years the value of import content in HAL manufactured platforms has been Rs. 19085 Crores.


    The following steps have been taken by the Government to boost the indigenous component manufacturing industry;

      * In order to identify capable vendors for indigenization, Government is organizing various vendor development programs like Defence Industry Development Meet and DEFEXPO.
      * Under ‘Make in India’, public as well as private sector industries have been encouraged to participate in indigenous design, development & manufacture of defence equipment.
      * Under DPP-2016, new procedures for Make-I and Make-II have been incorporated in ‘Buy Indian – Indigenous Design Development and Manufacturing (IDDM)’ category to give an impetus to industry with an objective of self-reliance.
      * Enhancement of technological capabilities of Indian industry through the ‘offset’ route has been considered.
      * A new Technology Development Fund (TDF) Scheme with objectives of funding the development of defence and dual use technologies which are presently not available with the Indian defence industry or have not been developed, has been set up.
      * Technology Perspective and Capability Roadmap (TPCR) which aims to give out the details of equipment and technology required by Armed Forces has been put in public domain to seek specific capabilities of the Indian industries in the long term.
      * Indian Air Force has identified 14 potential Make projects (out of which two with leading role of Indian Army and Indian Navy) which envisage execution through private industries.
      * Through outsourcing, HAL has been encouraging Indian private industries having established capabilities to supply airborne items / aircraft / helicopter / sub-assemblies. HAL has created a Research & Development corpus with 10% of its Operational Profit After Tax for Research & Development activities both in-house and with private vendors.
      * A ‘Make in India’ portal has been launched on HAL website to encourage private industries’ participation. A large number of systems and sub-systems for Su-30 MKI, Advance Light Helicopter,Light Combat Aircraft, Do-228, Hawk and Jaguar aircrafts have been hosted for indigenous development. A number of Tools Testers and Ground Equipment (TTGE) items of Su-30 MKI aircraft have also been taken up by private companies.
