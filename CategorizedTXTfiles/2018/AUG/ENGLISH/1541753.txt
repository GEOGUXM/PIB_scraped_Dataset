      Rural Beneficiaries under PMAY
      Posted On: 06 AUG 2018 5:24PM by PIB Delhi


    Selection of beneficiaries under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G) is based on housing deprivation parameters of Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011, subject to 13 point exclusion criteria, followed by Gram Sabha verification. Households that are houseless or living in zero, one or two room kutcha houses (kutcha wall and kutcha roof) are provided financial assistance for construction of pucca houses under PMAY-G. Detailed procedure for identification and selection of beneficiaries is given in the Framework for Implementation (FFI) of PMAY-G which is available on pmayg.nic.in.


    Under PMAY-G, financial assistance is provided only to those households who have been found eligible, after due procedure, from SECC list.


    This information was provided by the Minister of State for Rural Development, Shri Ram Kripal Yadav today in a written reply to a Question in Rajya Sabha.
