    In February 2018, an Expert Committee under the chairpersonship of Secretary, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, with representatives from relevant Ministries, industry associations, research institutions and experts was constituted by the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy to propose draft for setting up National Energy Storage Mission (NESM) for India. The Expert Committee referred has proposed a draft NESM with objective to strive for leadership in energy storage sector by creating an enabling policy and regulatory framework that encourages manufacturing, deployment, innovation and further cost reduction.


    NITI Aayog and Rocky Mountain Institute’s joint report on India’s Energy Storage Mission has proposed three stage solution approach i.e. creating an environment for battery manufacturing growth; scaling supply chain strategies; and scaling of battery cell manufacturing.


    The report is available at (http://www.niti.gov.in/writereaddata/files/document_publication/India-Energy-StorageMission.pdf).


    Energy Storage is one of the most crucial & critical components of India's energy infrastructure strategy and also for supporting India's sustained thrust to renewables.


    Key areas for energy storage application include:

     1. integrating renewable energy with distribution and transmission grids;
     2. setting Rural micro grids with diversified loads or stand-alone systems; and
     3. developing Storage component of electric mobility plans.

    This was informed by Shri R. K Singh Minister of State (I/C) for New and Renewable Energy and Power in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
