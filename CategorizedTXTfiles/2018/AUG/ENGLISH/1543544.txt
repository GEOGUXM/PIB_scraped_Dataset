    * The change in the NEET exam pattern (as against the statement made on 7th July 2018), which will now be a single exam in pen-and-paper mode and in the same number of languages as has been conducted last year, is on the request of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, who wanted the same pattern followed last year to be maintained.


    NTA is also establishing a countrywide network of test practice centres (TPCs) for students of rural areas so that everyone will have an opportunity to practice before the exam. (2,697) Schools/engineering colleges with computer centres are being made available on every Saturday/Sunday starting from 1st September, 2018 and any student can use the facility free of charge. An App is being developed which will enable the students to choose the nearest TPC.


    The TPCs will have a downloaded Computer Based Test (CBT) which will be similar to the actual test to be conducted on the exam day. The practice tests will help the candidates to familiarize themselves with logging into the system, going through the detailed instructions regarding the test, using the mouse or numeric keyboard on screen (virtual) for attempting each question, scrolling down to the next question, navigating between questions, reviewing and editing their options and submit questions.
