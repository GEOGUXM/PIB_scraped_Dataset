      Conversion of cantonments into “Exclusive Military Stations”
      Posted On: 06 AUG 2018 3:56PM by PIB Delhi


    There are 62 Cantonments, governed by the Cantonments Act, 2006, located in 19 States with a population of about 20.76 lakhs. Cantonments have and continue to play an important role in delivery of services to the inhabitants residing in the cantonments. Apart from carrying out municipal functions like, sanitation, running of STPs, street lighting, drainage, etc., they also undertake numerous developmental activities. Cantonments with a 250-year history are important institutions that bear testimony to the harmonious co-existence of civilians and defence personnel. The Army has suggested excision of civil areas of Cantonments and converting military pockets into Military Stations. No decision has been taken in the matter.
