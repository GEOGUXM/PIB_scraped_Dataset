    Following is the text of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's departure statement prior to his visit to Nepal.


    “I will be in Kathmandu on a two-day visit on 30-31 August, to participate in the Fourth BIMSTEC Summit.


    My participation in the Summit symbolises India's highest priority to our neighbourhood and our strong commitment to continue deepening our relationship with the extended neighbourhood in South-East Asia.


    During the Summit, I will have interactions with all the leaders of BIMSTEC to further enrich our regional cooperation, enhance our trade ties and advance our collective efforts to build a peaceful and prosperous Bay of Bengal region.


    The Summit theme, “Towards a Peaceful, Prosperous and Sustainable Bay of Bengal Region” will enable us to shape a collective response to our common aspirations and challenges.


    I am confident that the Fourth BISMTEC Summit will further consolidate the progress made thus far under BIMSTEC, and will chart the course for building a peaceful and prosperous Bay of Bengal Region.


    On the margins of the BIMSTEC Summit, I will have the opportunity to interact with the leaders of Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand.


    I also look forward to meeting Prime Minister of Nepal, Rt. Hon. K.P. Sharma Oli and reviewing the progress we have made in our bilateral ties since my last visit to Nepal in May 2018.


    Prime Minister Oli and I will have the honour and privilege to inaugurate the Nepal Bharat Maitri Dharmashala at the Pashupatinath temple complex.”
