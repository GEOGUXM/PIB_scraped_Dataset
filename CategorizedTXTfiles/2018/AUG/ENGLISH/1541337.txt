      Posted On: 02 AUG 2018 5:31PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government of India on 15.6.1999 (further amended on 25.6.2002) has laid down modalities for determining claims for inclusion in and other modifications in the lists of Scheduled Tribes. According to these, only those proposals recommended and justified by State Government / UT Administration concerned and concurred with by Registrar General of India (RGI) and National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) are considered for amendment of legislation. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs has not received any proposal from Government of Odisha for inclusion of Kudmi and Routia tribes in the list of Scheduled Tribes of Odisha. As per extant modalities, recommendation of State Government is a pre-requisite, to process the proposal further.


    This information was given by the Union Minister of State for Tribal Affairs Shri. Sudarshan Bhagat in Rajya Sabha today.
