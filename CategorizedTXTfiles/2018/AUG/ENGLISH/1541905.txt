      Posted On: 07 AUG 2018 3:13PM by PIB Delhi


    In order to ensure uniformity and standardization in the specialized task of personal protection duties, the Government has decided to progressively relieve CRPF from personal protection duties and assign this task to CISF and NSG.


    At present, in SPG about 30% officers are from CRPF on deputation; and in NSG it is about 11%.


    All CAPFs, including CRPF, work in challenging conditions in LWE affected areas and in Jammu & Kashmir.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.
