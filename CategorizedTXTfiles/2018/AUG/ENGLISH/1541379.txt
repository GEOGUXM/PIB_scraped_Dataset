    The Ministry of Women and Child Development has also requested Ministry of Finance for amendment to section 64 of the Income Tax Act,1961 for not including income arising from the asset transferred for inadequate consideration by an individual to his wife or son’s wife.


    As informed by the Central Board of Direct Tax (CBDT), Department of Revenue, under the existing provisions of the Income Tax Act,1961, any sum of money received by a person without consideration is liable for taxation if the aggregate value of such sum exceeds Rs.50,000.

However, these provisions are not applicable to receipts of any sum/ immovable property/specified property by an individual from following relatives: ¾


    (i) spouse of the individual;


    (ii) brother or sister of the individual;

    (v) any lineal ascendant or descendant of the individual;


    (vi) any lineal ascendant or descendant of the spouse of the individual;
