      Posted On: 13 AUG 2018 8:55PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government of India supplements the effort of the State Government by providing assistance for relief of immediate nature through State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) as per established procedure.


    A State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) has been constituted for each State. The Central Government contributes 75% for General Category States and 90% for Special Category States of the assessed SDRF each year.


    The first charge of relief expenditure is on SDRF and in the cases of calamities of severe nature, it is supplemented from NDRF as per established procedure. Financial assistance under SDRF/ NDRF in the wake of natural calamities is by way of relief and not for compensation of loss as suffered/ claimed. Additional expenditure, if any, incurred over and above or on other than approved items/ norms, is required to be met by the States from their own resources.

    In the case of notified natural calamities, as per the established procedure, the State Government is required to submit a detailed memorandum indicating the sector-wise details of damage and requirement of funds for relief operations of immediate nature. On receipt of a memorandum, an Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) is deputed for an on-the-spot assessment of damages and additional requirement of funds. The report of IMCT is considered by the Sub-Committee of National Executive Committee (SC-NEC) headed by the Union Home Secretary and then by a High Level Committee (HLC), chaired by the Union Home Minister for approving the quantum of additional assistance, from the NDRF.


    In the instant case, based on a preliminary memorandum submitted by Government of Kerala for additional assistance of Rs. 831.10 crore, IMCT was constituted immediately on July 25, 2018. IMCT have visited flood/ landslides affected areas in the State from August 7-12, 2018. Upon receipt of report from IMCT, it will be processed for placing before the SC-NEC and HLC for consideration, as per established procedure. Though enough funds are available in SDRF, however the Union Home Minister has announced release of Rs. 100 crore in advance from NDRF to help the State in providing relief measures to the affected people.


    In the instant case, the Central Government has been providing full support to the Government of Kerala by mobilizing/ providing timely logistics and financial resources to supplement the efforts of the State Government to deal with the situation effectively in the wake of floods/ landslides. The logistics support provided includes 14 teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Indian Air Force and Coast Guard helicopters, Army columns, Navy & Coast Guard personnel along with necessary rescue equipments.
