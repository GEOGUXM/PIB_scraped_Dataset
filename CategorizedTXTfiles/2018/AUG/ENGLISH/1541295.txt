    Portable Visual Kits for detection of Fluoride, Chromium and Iron have been developed and technology for indigenous manufacturing of these kits is transferred to six private entrepreneurs and product is available in the market. In all detection kits developed, reagents kept inside different bottles are to be added to the water sample. Reagents are added and mixed for two minutes. Within 5 minutes, colour develops in the top layer, the intensity of colour is compared with a colour chart by visual inspection to obtain the concentration range of contaminant in water.


    Iron Contamination detection kit is at advanced stage of development and very soon will be available to private entrepreneurs.


    The technology is introduced in country through technology transfers to private entrepreneurs. Kits are available in market based on DAE technology. It can be utilised to remove related contamination. These kits are commercially marketed by licensees for public use and it can be procured for the use by the public.
