      Issue of Kisan Credit Cards
      Posted On: 07 AUG 2018 6:18PM by PIB Delhi


    The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme was introduced in 1998 for issue of KCC to farmers so that farmers may use them to readily purchase agriculture inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides etc. and draw cash for their production needs.


    The KCC scheme has since been simplified and provides for issue of ATM enabled RuPay Debit Card, inter alia, with facilities of one-time documentation, built-in cost escalation in the limit, and any number of drawals within the limit, etc.


    State-wise number of operative KCCs as on 31 March 2018 in respect of Scheduled Commercial Banks, as reported by Reserve Bank of India (RBI), is at Annexure I . State-wise number of operative KCCs as on 31 March 2018 in respect of Cooperative Banks and Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), as reported by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), is at Annexure II.
