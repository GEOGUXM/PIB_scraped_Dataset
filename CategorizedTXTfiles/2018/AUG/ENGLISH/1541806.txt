      NCTE periodically conducts inspection of Private Teachersâ€™ Training Institutes to ensure Quality Education
      Posted On: 06 AUG 2018 6:32PM by PIB Delhi


    The National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) Act, 1993 allows both private and government institutions to run teacher education programmes. Private institutions recognized by NCTE are running 22963 Teacher Education Courses.


    While Section 14 & 15 of the NCTE Act stipulate for grant of recognition, Section 13 is meant for ensuring quality among the recognized teacher education institutions. NCTE conducts inspections periodically and takes punitive action, including withdrawal of recognition, wherever necessary.


    The NCTE Act, 1993 and Regulations framed allow only not for profit institutions to run Teacher Education Programmes.


    Evaluation on quality parameters is an ongoing process. Between 01.04.2017 to 01.06.2018, Recognition of 391 institutions has been withdrawn under Section 17 of the NCTE 1993.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Shri Upendra Kushwaha today in a written reply to a Lok Sabha question.
