    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:

         1. Crude oil production by ONGC during July, 2018 was 1789.09 TMT which is 7.4%lower than the monthly target and6.7%lower when compared with July, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-July, 2018 was 7181.43 TMT which is 3.4%lower than target for the period andlowerby 5.0% thanproduction during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall are as under:

             1. Electric Submersible Pumps (ESP) problem in wells of NBP field (Rig deployment post monsoon).

             2. Increasing water- cut in Neelam and B-173 fields and less than anticipated production from some wells of Vasai East.
             3. Sub-sea leakage in some well fluid lines of Mumbai High & Neelam Heera Assets leading to flow restriction (Repairing/line replacement to commence post monsoon).
             4. Less than envisaged production from B-127 cluster.

         1. Crude oil production by OIL during July, 2018 was287.18 TMT which is 6.20%lower than monthly target and 0.39% lower when compared with July, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-July, 2018 was 1125.07 TMT which is 4.35% lower than target for the period and0.33%lower than production during the corresponding period of last year. Major reason for lower production is-less than planned contribution from work over wells and drilling wells.


         1. Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during July, 2018 was 819.97 TMT which is 5.17% lower than the monthly target and 4.12%lowerthanJuly, 2017.Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-July, 2018 was 3396.91 TMT which is 0.96 %lowerthan target for the periodand at par with the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall are as under:


     1. Panna-Mukta: Plant shutdown due to SPM integrity issue. (SHELL).

     2. RJ-ON-90/1: Around 55 oil wells are closed due to various reasons like high water cut, require WOJ, etc. (CEIL).

    2. Natural Gas


    Natural gas production during July, 2018 was 2713.52 MMSCM which is 9.73% lower than the target for the month and5.08% lower when compared with July, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production during April-July, 2018 was 10782.35MMSCM which is 7.69% lower than target for the period and1.23% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year.Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II . Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of July, 2018 and cumulatively for the period April-July, 2018 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

    Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production


         1. Natural gas production by ONGC during July, 2018 was 2044.98 MMSCM which is 6.71% lower than the monthly targetand0.5% lower when compared with July, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC duringApril-July, 2018 was 7951.17MMSCM which is 5.94% lower than the cumulative target but2.14% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year.The reasons for shortfall are as under:


     1. Restricted off-take ex-Odalarevu in Eastern Offshore Asset.

     2. Delay in completion of one development well in Rajahmundry.
     3. Sharp decline in gas production from GS-4 sand in Gandhar field.
     4. Less off-take by consumers/ grid restrictions in Tripura.

         1. Natural gas production by OIL during July, 2018 was 231.09 MMSCM which is 14.79% lower than the monthly targetand7.65% lower than July, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-July, 2018 was 900.44 MMSCM which is 14.75% and7.53% lower than the cumulative target and production respectively during the corresponding period of last year. Major reason for lower production is loss of well head production potential of high producing wells of Deohal area, due to downhole tubing corrosion.


         1. Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during July, 2018 was 437.45 MMSCM which is 19.4% lower than the monthly target and20.92% lower when compared with July, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-July, 2018 was 1930.73MMSCM which is 11.06% lower than the cumulative target and10.56% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall are as under:


     1. Panna-Mukta: Plant shutdown due to SPM integrity issue. (SHELL).

     2. KG-DWN-98/3: Closure of 2 wells in D1D3 and 1 well in MA field. (RIL)
     3. Sohagpur West CBM Block: Underperformance of CBM wells (RIL).

     1. Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)


    Refinery production during July, 2018 was 22409.68TMT which is 6.44%higher than the target for the month and9% higherwhen compared with July, 2017. Cumulative production during April-July, 2018 was 86368.63 TMT which is 1.82% higher than the target for the period and6.02% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III .

    Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production(Crude Processed)


         1. CPSE Refineries’ production during July, 2018 was 12910.30TMT which is 6.78%higher than the target for the month and 7.66%higher when compared with July, 2017.Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-July, 2018 was 50035.87 TMT which is 2.16% higher than the target for the period and 4.93% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. The shortfall of refinery production in NRL, Numaligarh & MRPL, Mangalore due to u llage constraints in Intermediate Stock.


    3.2 Production in JV refineries during July, 2018 was 1674.69TMT which is 9.96% higher than the target for the month and119.64% higherwhen compared with July, 2017.Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-July, 2018 was 6517.76 TMT which is 10.17% higher than the target for the period and94.14%higherthan the production during corresponding period of last year . The major reason for high variation in production was major turnaround in HMEL refinery undertaken during April - July, 2017.


    3.3 Production in private refineries during July, 2018 was 7824.69TMT which is higherby 5.18% than the target for the month and0.25% higherwhen compared with July, 2017. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-July, 2018 was 29815 TMT which is 0.38% and 1.98% lower when compared to target and production during corresponding period of last year respectively.


    3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of July, 2018 and cumulatively for the period April-July, 2018 vis-à-vis April-July, 2017 are given at Annexures -IV and V respectively.
