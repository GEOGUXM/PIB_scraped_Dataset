    Emphasising that India's emission intensity of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has reduced by 12% between 2005 and 2010 (as per India’s first BUR) in line with our voluntary goal of reducing emission intensity of GDP by 20-25% by 2020 over 2005 level, Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Mahesh Sharma has said that the greenhouse gases (GHG) emission inventory for the country is prepared according to the requirements under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha here today, Dr. Sharma pointed out that these estimates are based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. He added that State or city level greenhouse gas inventories are not required to be submitted and hence not prepared by Government of India. He added that National Communications (NATCOMs) are submitted periodically followed by an update called the Biennial Update Report (BUR) every 2 years.


    The Minister also stated that the commitments under Paris Agreement, called “Nationally Determined Contributions” (NDC), are to be implemented in post 2020 period. “These contributions would be achieved through the schemes of various missions under the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) and actions under the State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC)”, Dr. Sharma said.
