    Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) provides funds to the State Governments for the activities relating to cultural conservation of tribal areas in the country based on their demand. Government has decided to set up new Tribal Research Institutes (TRIs) in the States where no TRI exists. During the year 2017-18 and 2018-19, based on the proposals received from the States of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Sikkim and Mizoram, funds have been provided for establishment of new Tribal Research Institute. Presently, TRIs are functioning in 24 States and 1UT. Core responsibility of TRIs is to function as a body of knowledge & research more or less as a think tank for tribal development and preservation of tribal cultural heritage. Details of funds provided to the State TRIs during 2015-16 to 2017-18 is as under:
