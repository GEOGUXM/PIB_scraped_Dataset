    The re-structured rural housing scheme Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G) which has the objective of “Housing for All by 2022” was launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister on 20 th November, 2016 from Agra. 2.95 crore houses are set to be constructed by 2022 to achieve the set objective of PMAY-G which has been decided to achieve in phases. In the first phase the target is construction of one crore pucca houses by 31 st March, 2019.


    A total of 1.07 crore rural houses have been completed over the last four years (2014-15 to 2017-18) which include completion of 38.20 lakh Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY- G) houses and 68.64 lakh IAY houses that were sanctioned in 2014-15 and 2015-16 and prior to that. If the figures of the current financial year are also added to this achievement under the rural housing scheme the achievement from 2014-15 till date becomes 1.13 crore completed rural houses. The details of rural housing scheme and progress can be seen from the website of PMAY-G, i.e. ( pmayg.nic.in ).

    As on 31.07.2018


    The confidence on timely completion is further strengthened by a recent study conducted by National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), New Delhi, which has concluded that the average time of construction of a house under PMAY-G has gone down to 114 days as against 314 days under the erstwhile rural housing scheme, i.e. IAY. In view of the availability of 240 days till March, 2019, and keeping in view the current pace of construction of PMAY-G houses and various initiatives of the Ministry to closely track the progress of construction, the target of completion of 1.00 crore pucca houses under PMAY-G would be achieved by March, 2019. In this way Government would construct 1.70 crore rural houses between April, 2014 and March, 2019.


    The completed PMAY-G houses are changing the rural landscape and bringing social transformation in villages across the country.
