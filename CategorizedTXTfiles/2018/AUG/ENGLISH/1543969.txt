    The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Raksha Bandan is a symbol of care and protection. He was addressing more than 100 School Children from various Schools in Delhi who came to his residence to tie Rakhi on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, here today.


    The Vice President said that it is an ancient Bharatheeya tradition and t he festival of Raksha Bandhan, traditionally a celebration of human bonding between sisters and brothers, has a larger significance for contemporary times and probably for all times. It is celebration of solidarity, a celebration of unity and a celebration of humanism, he added.


    The Vice President said that let us tie that Rakhi that binds us all together. Let us forget all the differences that tend to fragment our social fabric, he added.


    The Vice President said that Raksha Bandhan signifies the invisible bond between brother and sister and it also reflects inherent implication of protection of a sister by the brother. He further said that let us all uphold the tradition of Raksha Bandhan by ensuring protection and respecting dignity of all women. Beti bachao, Beti Padhao and Beti Badaao should be the mantra of every Indian, he added.


    The Minister for External Affairs, Smt. Sushma Swaraj visited the Vice President's residence and tied the Rakhi to him. The spouse of the Vice President, Smt. Usha Naidu was present on the occasion and exchanged warm greetings on Raksha Bandhan.
