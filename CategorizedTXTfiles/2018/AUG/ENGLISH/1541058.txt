      Green corridor in Railways
      Posted On: 01 AUG 2018 5:34PM by PIB Delhi


    As a part of “Swachh Bharat Mission”, Indian Railways is proliferating bio-toilets on its coaching stock so that no human waste is discharged from coaches on to the track. In order to demonstrate the advantage of fitment of Bio-toilets, 06 green corridors were made functional in 2016-17 and 21 in 2017-2018.


    On green corridors, the introduction of bio-toilets in coaches has been done to avoid direct discharge of human excreta on Railway tracks/station premises. This benefits the common man as foul smell, unhygienic surrounding as well as shabby look are avoided. All the human excreta is collected in an eco-friendly bio-tank fitted under each toilet. The bio-tank decomposes the fecal matter and converts it into water and gases.


    This information was given by the Minister of State of Railways, Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
