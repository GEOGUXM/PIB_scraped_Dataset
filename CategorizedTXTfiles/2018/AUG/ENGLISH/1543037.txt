    SHAURYA CHAKRA


    CAPT P RAJKUMAR (03228-K)


    1. A very severe cyclonic storm Ockhi struck southern coast of India in end Nov/ early Dec 17 causing massive devastation and claiming lives of at least 218 people. On 01 Dec 17, Captain P Rajkumar (03228-K) was the Captain of naval helicopter Sea King 528 and the officer and his crew flew sorties from Trivandrum throughout the day for search and rescue operations. While braving the fury of nature and undertaking rescue missions, the officer rescued four survivors from the rough seas during the day.


    2. Whilst disembarking the survivors at Trivandrum at about 1830 hrs, one of them reported sighting one fisherman, adrift at sea. It was post sunset and the crew was at the limit of their fatigue , having flown throughout the day. Also, the aircraft had flown continuously with two hot re-fuelling and no Turn Round Servicing, and there was considerable risk involved in undertaking a fresh mission . However, with no regard to his safety, Capt Rajkumar took a tough call and decided to fly the life threatening mission on the stormy night of cyclone to save the solitary survivor in the raging sea. His risk was considerably enhanced by the fact that, neither the aircraft nor the crew was equipped with any Night Vision Devices.


    3. Flying against all odds he reached the area 30 nautical miles into rough seas on a pitch dark night, and descended his helicopter to as low as 200 feet to search for the survivor. About 25 minutes into search, the survivor was sighted clutching onto a capsized boat. With his vast experience and superior piloting skills, the officer brought the enormous aircraft into a hover at 25 feet over the raging sea, in a pitch dark night , heavy swell , nil visibility and with no night vision aids . A slight error could crash the aircraft and its crew into the raging seas. Several attempts were made to position the rescue strop over the survivor; however the survivor continued to cling onto the capsized boat making no attempts to leave the lifeline in his hand. At this juncture he took a very bold decision viz to lower a diver into the water by night , in order to assist the survivor in wearing the strop. Had this daring action gone wrong, it would have resulted in losing two lives instead of one. Having dispatched the diver, the officer now maintained an extremely difficult manual hover for almost 30 minutes unmindful of his own safety , with the aircraft being subjected to extreme weather conditions. Anything could have gone wrong at this stage, as both the men and machinery were operating at their extreme limits .


    4. The bold decision and daring act of the officer enabled saving a human life in extreme conditions and was possible only because of the sheer determination, courage and decision making abilities of the officer. For the undeterred commitment to save human life in the most trying conditions accompanied by courage, fortitude and display of valour in the face of danger, the officer is recommended for the award of Shaurya Chakra .

    LT CDR VARTIKA JOSHI (43077-A)


    1. Lt Cdr Vartika Joshi volunteered for Indian Navy’s expedition, Navika Sagar Parikrama – an all woman circumnavigation of the globe under sails on INSV TARINI. This expedition was unique as it was the maiden attempt by an all women naval officers crew to sail around the globe in a yacht, covering a distance of nearly 22,300 nautical miles (41,255 Km). Lt Cdr Vartika Joshi was nominated as skipper of the vessel and therefore her responsibility had increased manifold. Prior to setting sail on their global mission, the officer trained hard and mapped Indian Ocean and South Atlantic Oceans under sail, as part of their training for the arduous expedition. The officer had a minimum of 20,000 nautical miles of sailing experience to qualify for the challenge. Since, this was the first ever Indian circumnavigation of the globe by an all-women crew, it highlighted women empowerment to the rest of the world and has set an example for other Indian women to emulate.


    2. The expedition commenced on 10 Sep 17 from Goa and was completed on 21 May 18 at Goa. Thus, the officer, as a participant of the expedition spent more than spent more than 06 month (194 days) at sea and nearly 08 months away from home port. Such prolonged duration at sea in inhospitable conditions requires courage, determination and a never-say-die attitude. Also, the officer sailed through a number of oceans and seas, some of which are known to be constantly perilous because of prevailing rough weather and sea conditions. The entire voyage was completed using sails, regularly negotiating 10m waves and over 100 Kmph winds with the temperatures varying between 4 to 40 degree Celsius as the vessel traversed through different parts of the world. The officer was often over 4000 to 5000 Km from the nearest land and beyond the range of any meaningful rescue operation in the event of an emergency. In such trying circumstances, it is the skipper who is single handedly responsible for safety of the ship and crew, and Lt Cdr Vartika Joshi, as skipper, displayed courage, high professional acumen and motivational skills of high order to ensure successful culmination of the expedition.


    3. At about 2000h on 14 Jan 18, as INSV Tarini negotiated the treacherous waters off the Cape Horn, often dubbed ‘the graveyard of ships’ owing to the dangerous seas conditions in the Pacific Ocean, she was overtaken by a cold front with winds gusting upto 130 Kmph. The turbulent weather caused large 10 meter high waves to come crashing down onto the boat thereby de-capacitating the crew. At this juncture the skipper deftly steered the boat keeping it safe by applying the best navigation and seamanship practices suited to the prevailing circumstances and sea conditions. The storm lasted for one whole day and the boat was maneuvered with exceptional daring and courage to remain afloat. The officer worked undauntedly to save the boat, thus avoiding a situation that could have required the launch of an international rescue effort.


    4. Successful completion of circumnavigation voyage over 194 days at sea is a testimony of the raw courage, endurance and professionalism displayed by the officer and is in keeping with the finest traditions of the Navy. Lt Cdr Vartika Joshi (43077-A) is therefore strongly recommended for the award of Nao Sena Medal (Gallantry).

    LT CDR ANIL RAINA ( 05821-B)


    Lieutenant Commander Anil Raina (05821 B) was deployed as the Team Leader of Naval Marine Commandos at Wular Lake in Op Rakshak. On 07 Jan 18, the officer displayed a high level of professional competence, daring and personal example, when he successfully planned and led an operation that resulted in apprehension of two hardcore Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists and an Over Ground Worker (OGW) . The officer meticulously planned the ambush operation in a semi urban setting to execute the mission without any collateral damage in a populated civilian area. He positioned himself and his team members in an area offering a clear field of view of the planned ambush site, despite the dangers of receiving hostile fire at close quarters . On sighting the two terrorists, the officer kept his calm and decided to physically apprehend them so as to avoid any civilian casualty. On being suddenly confronted at close quarters, the two militants and one OGW attempted a quick escape. Realising this, the officer displayed exemplary courage and with total disregard to personnel safety charged on one of the terrorist, who was on the verge of lobbing a grenade and quickly overpowered him whilst also signalling his other teammates to apprehend the other terrorist before they could open fire on them. This gallant act of the Officer resulted in apprehension of both the hard-core terrorists and an OGW without any casualty to self or civilian population in the vicinity. The capture of terrorists and OGW alive enabled apprehension of additional nine OGWs of hardcore terrorist organization thereby delivering a severe blow to their activities in the area . For this act of stupendous courage in the face of enemy, display of sound leadership in the face of adversity, concern for safety of his men and civilian population, which is in keeping with the highest tradition of the Service, Lieutenant Commander Anil Raina is strongly recommended for award of “Nao Sena Medal (Gallantry)” .

Such prolonged duration at sea in inhospitable conditions requires courage, determination and a never-say-die attitude. Also, the officer sailed through a number of oceans and seas, some of which are known to be constantly perilous because of prevailing rough weather and sea conditions. The officer encountered rough seas on number of occasions with wave height reaching up to 10 meters. The strong wind conditions (60 to 65 knots) in sea conditions like Sea State 6 presented a constant threat of capsizing to the boat and crew. Prolonged exposure to such weather conditions is very demanding and it is only through high standard of mental and physical fitness that the officer could endure such conditions. The officer had to undertake multiple tasks in addition to sailing which included activities like navigation, repair of machinery as well as sailing gear, cooking, watch keeping and steering the boat etc. All these tasks, when undertaken during hazardous weather conditions are very challenging and demand physical strength, professional competence, resilience and will of very high order. Tremendous grit and determination is required to overcome these challenges which are both psychological and physical. The physical exhaustion is further accentuated due to lack of sound sleep attributed to turbulent sea conditions and restricted living spaces. This is the first time in the country that an all women team has raised the bars of extreme adventure by setting sail around the world on a 56 feet sailing boat displaying raw courage, endurance and professionalism.


    3. The officer has successfully accomplished all the objectives of a global circumnavigation and achieved a historic landmark for Indian women. In view of her unique achievement and courage Lt Cdr Pratibha Jamwal (07109-F), crew of Indian Naval Sailing Vessel Tarini is therefore strongly recommended for the award of Nao Sena Medal (Gallantry) .

    DEEPAK SAINI, POA(FD), NO 138915-T


    1. Cyclone Ockhi lashed Kerala by nightfall on 30 Nov 17, stranding hundreds of fishermen at sea. At 2000 hrs on 01 Dec 17, Deepak Saini POA (FD) as part of aircrew of Search and Rescue (SAR) helicopter was tasked as free diver for SAR by night. Locating the lone survivor in pitch dark night, gusting winds, torrential rains and high swell, Saini POAFD, regardless of personal safety, volunteered to be winched down to aid the survivor in highly adverse weather . Braving waves over 4 meters high and only an Omni glow for visual reference, Saini, donned the strop on the barely alive fisherman. Despite the extreme risk of getting lost in the pitch black sea , Saini opted to stay behind and sent the civilian to safety.


    2. At 1315 hrs on 02 Dec 17, Saini was once again lowered to rescue four extremely weak fishermen from a boat. The strop whilst being lowered got entangled with an antenna on the boat, posing a potentially fatal emergency for the helicopter at low hover. Showing exemplary presence of mind , Saini disconnected the strop, climbed atop the bridge in a flash, disentangled the winch wire and then reconnected the strop before dispatching the last survivor to safety. All this while he was exposed to grave risk of injuring himself and drowning at sea.


    3. Deepak Saini POA (FD), amidst a Severe Cyclonic Storm rescued lives of five fishermen . He also averted a potentially fatal helicopter emergency . For these exemplary acts of bravery in the face of grave danger the sailor is recommended for award of Nao Sena Medal (Gallantry) .
