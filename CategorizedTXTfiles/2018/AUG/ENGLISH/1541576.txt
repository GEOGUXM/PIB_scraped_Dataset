      E-way Bill System
      Posted On: 03 AUG 2018 6:14PM by PIB Delhi


    The E-way Bill System has been introduced nation-wide for inter-State movement of goods with effect from 1 st April, 2018 while the States were given the option to choose any date till 3 rd June, 2018 for the introduction of the E-way bill system for intra-State supplies. Consequently, all the States have notified the E-way bill system for intra-State supplies, the last being the National Capital Territory of Delhi which introduced it with effect from 16 th June, 2018. The objectives of E-way bill system are as below:


     1. single and unified E-way bill for inter-State and intra-State movement of goods for the whole country in self-service mode,


     1. enabling paperless and fully online system to facilitate seamless movement of goods across all the States,


     1. improve service delivery with quick turnaround time for the entire supply chain and provide anytime anywhere access to data/services,


     1. to facilitate hassle free movement of goods by abolishing inter-State check posts across the country.


    The E-way Bill System was scheduled to be launched on 1 st February, 2018 for inter-State movement of goods. However, intra-State E-way bill was also made mandatory by some States from 1 st February 2018 which resulted in increase in the number of transactions on the portal. Due to limited server capacity, the Information Technology (IT) infrastructure of the E-way bill system could not handle the load and crashed within few hours of operation on 1 st February, 2018. A total of 4.5 lakhs E-way bills could be generated that day.


    The Union Government deferred the introduction of the E-way Bill System till 1 st April, 2018. Further, the Government took various corrective steps in this regard viz., new Information Technology (IT) infrastructure including high end servers were installed to handle the increased load on the system. The upgraded system is capable of handling a peak load of 75 lakh E-way bills per day. As a result, the E-way bill system is now being successfully implemented since 1 st April, 2018 across the country. As on 30 th July, 2018, a total of 7,58,75,207 E-way bills for intra-State movement and 7,81,51,096 E-way bills for Inter-State movement of goods have been generated on the common portal www.ewaybillgst.gov.in .


    This was stated by Shri Shiv Pratap Shukla, Minister of State for Finance in a Written Reply to a Question in Lok Sabha today.
