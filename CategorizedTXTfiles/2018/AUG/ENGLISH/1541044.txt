    The Central Government attaches highest importance to the safety and security to every citizen of the country including journalists. The existing laws for protection of citizens also cover journalists. ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.


    Also the Press Council of India takes appropriate action on receipt of specific complaints from affected journalists. An advisory on safety of journalists has been issued to States/UTs on 20th October 2017, which is available at the Ministry of Home Affairs’ website viz. www.mha.gov.in .


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
