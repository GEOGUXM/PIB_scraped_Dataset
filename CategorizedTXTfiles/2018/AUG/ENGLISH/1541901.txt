      Posted On: 07 AUG 2018 3:10PM by PIB Delhi


    The Ministry of Home affairs vide Home Secretary’s D.O. letter dated 14.7.2015, requested all the Directors General of Police (DsGP) of State Governments/Union Territories, to make necessary arrangements and have a system in place that would ensure uploading of positive stories/good work being done at Police station level or by any other police office at District level or below, to mitigate the negative public image of the police. The D.O. letter was followed by another communication dated 14.10.2017 from MHA.


    As per information available, a total of 44,708 positive stories/good works have been uploaded on the respective State or District police Websites. Besides, Bureau of Police Research and Development based on deliberations on SMART policing announced by the Hon’ble PM in DGP/IGP Conference in 2014 has uploaded in its Website ( www.bprd.nic.in ) 43 best practices of States/UTs.


    Further, as Police is a State subject falling in List-II (State List) of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, it is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments/UT Administrations to improve the overall public image of police personnel.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.
