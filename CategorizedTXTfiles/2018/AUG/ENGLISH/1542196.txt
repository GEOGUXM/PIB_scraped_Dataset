    In the last four years, 2555 km of New Line, 3396 km of Gauge Conversion and 3577 km of Doubling has been commissioned. During 2017-18, 1862 km has been commissioned including 409 km of New Line, 454 km of Gauge Conversion and 999 km of Doubling.


    Safety is accorded the highest priority by Indian Railways and all possible steps are being undertaken on a continual basis including upgradation of technology to aid safe running of trains. Further, during 2017-18, due to highest priority given to safety works of track renewals and capacity constraints of supply of rails, commissioning of Railway Lines was less.


    This information was given by the Minister of State of Railways, Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
