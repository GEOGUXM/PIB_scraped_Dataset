    Provisions for financial assistance to States/UTs has been made under NFSA for purchase, operations and maintenance of ePoS devices in the form of additional dealer margin at the rate of Rs.17/quintal of foodgrains distributed through ePoS devices. Such expenditure would be shared between Centre and State Governments on 75:25 basis for 13 special category States/UTs and on 50:50 basis for 23 general category States/UTs. As per information received from States/UTs, out of total 5.29 lakh Fair Price Shops (FPSs) across the country, about 3.33 lakh FPSs have been automated so far. State/UT-wise number of automated FPSs is at Annexure. As reported by States/UTs, there are a few areas of poor internet connectivity and temporary unavailability of network. This department has issued clear instructions to States/UTs that no beneficiary/household should be denied of entitled quantity of foodgrains even if their authentication is not successful or due to unavailability of internet connectivity/technical failure.


    On the basis of peak stock requirement during normal procurement season, the overall storage capacity required for central pool food grains in the country is about 650 Lakh Metric Tonnes (LMT). Against this, the total storage capacity available with Food Corporation of India (FCI), Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and the State Agencies (both owned and hired capacity), is 855.98 LMT as on 30.06.2018 comprising 724.74 LMT in covered godowns and 131.24 LMT in Cover and Plinth (CAP) storage. As such, there is sufficient capacity for storage of central pool foodgrains at the national level.


    Under the scheme Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG), storage capacity is created by private parties, CWC, SWCs and other State Agencies for guaranteed hiring by FCI.
