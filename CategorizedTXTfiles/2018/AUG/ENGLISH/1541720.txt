      Posted On: 06 AUG 2018 4:00PM by PIB Delhi


    Indian Army & Border Security Force have adopted a robust counter infiltration strategy which has an appropriate mix of technology and human resource to check infiltration effectively. Innovative troop deployment, proactive use of surveillance and monitoring devices and the Anti-Infiltration Obstacle System have enhanced the ability to detect and intercept terrorists attempting to infiltrate / exfiltrate. Issues of infiltration / suspicious activity close to border are taken up regularly with Pakistan authorities at appropriate level through the established mechanism of hotlines, flag meetings as well as talks between the Director General of Military Operations of the two countries. BSF, too, holds regular talks at various levels with its counterpart viz. Pakistan Rangers.


    The details of ceasefire violations along the Line of Control (LoC) and International Border (IB) during last two months of the current year are as under:-
