    * Includes allocation of funds for meeting the committed liabilities of the


    Government under erstwhile schemes.


    State-wise details of farmer applicants covered during 2016-17 and 2017-18 are given in Annexure.


    There is decline in coverage of farmer applicants in 2017-18 from 2016-17. This is mainly due to factors like the announcement of Debt Waiver Scheme in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, farmerâ€™s perception of mitigated risk in 2017-18, which was a good monsoon year, deduplication due to Aadhaar being made mandatory for coverage etc..


    The scheme is optional for States. Notwithstanding that Government has been urging the States to bring more areas and crops under the scheme so that maximum farmers may be covered under the scheme. Besides that Government seeks active involvement of all stakeholders especially States and implementing insurance companies for conduct of publicity campaign/awareness programmes including organization of camps in the rural areas to build farmer awareness about crop insurance schemes. Other measures include release of advertisements on regular basis in leading National/local News Papers, telecast through audio-visual media, distribution of pamphlets in local languages, participation in agriculture fairs / mela / goshti, dissemination of SMS through Kisan Portal/National Crop Insurance Portal and conduct of workshops/ trainings of officials of State Governments and financial institutions and farmers Moreover, insurance companies have been asked to utilize 0.5% of gross premium collected by them for publicity and awareness generation. For non-loanee farmers since crop insurance is optional, the Common Service Centers (CSCs) and online enrolment have been activated to provide services besides traditional modes like banks and insurance intermediaries.
