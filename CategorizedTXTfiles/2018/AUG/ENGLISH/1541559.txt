      During the last three years and the current financial year, 65 new proposals have been received under the Working Women Hostels Scheme and 45 new hostels have been sanctioned.


      Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing Hostels for Working Women Scheme since 1972-73. The Scheme aims at providing safe and affordable accommodation to working women. These hostels have Day care facility for the children of inmates too. As per the norms of the Scheme, financial assistance is provided to the eligible implementing organizations such as State Government agencies and Civil Society Organizations through concerned State Government. The cost sharing ratio amongst the Central Government, States/ UTs (other than NE and Himalayan States) and Implementing Agencies is 60:15:25 for construction of building for Working Women Hostel/ running hostel in rented premises. For NE and Himalayan States, the ratio is 65:10:25. Corporate houses or associations like CII, ASSOCHAM, FICCI etc., can also seek financial assistance for a matching grant (50:50) for hostel building construction on public land only. There is also a provision of one-time non-recurring grant @ Rs. 7500/- per inmate for purchase of furniture and furnishings.


      Since its inception in 1972-73, 961 hostels have been sanctioned under the scheme all over the country . Regular monitoring of the functioning of the hostel is the responsibility of the District Women Welfare Committee under the Chairpersonship of District Collector/ District Magistrate/ Municipal Commissioner.


      Ministry has written letter to all States/UTs to monitor timely completion of all the sanctioned working women hostels in respective States/UTs including their occupancies. The Ministry has also requested to all State Governments to increase working women hostels in their States.
