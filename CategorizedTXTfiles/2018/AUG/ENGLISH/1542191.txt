    Railway Board has decided that a policy provision will be made that existing Multi Purpose Stalls (MPS) at Railway stations may be authorized to stock generic low-cost medicines also in accordance with the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) scheme. At present 03 chemist stalls are operational one each at (i) Mumbai Churchgate, (ii) Mumbai Central and (iii) Andheri Railway stations. The 01 chemist stall earlier operated at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus has been converted to Multi Purpose Stall under the existing Multi Purpose Stall (MPS) policy. The 01 chemist stall operational at Lokmanya Tilak Terminus is under process of conversion to Multi Purpose Stall. All these stations are within the territorial jurisdiction of Maharashtra State.


    Under the existing Multi Purpose Stall (MPS) policy, in order to have single outlet/stall at platforms for non catering items required during travelling, it has been decided to set up Multi Purpose Stalls (MPS) at Railway stations wherein items permitted for sale are miscellaneous items, books/magazines/news paper, chemist stall items-OTC (over the counter) medicines and non-pharmacy items viz.dry/spray milk powder etc. Allotment of Multi Purpose Stalls will be done by E-Tendering/normal Tendering.


    In the MPS policy, Retailers/Individuals/Self Help Groups (SHGs)/registered sole proprietorship firms or a partnership firm/company, incorporated under Partnership Act 1932/ Companies Act 1956 amended from time to time are eligible to participate in the bidding process.
