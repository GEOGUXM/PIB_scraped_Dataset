    Central Secretariat Manual of e-Office Procedure (CSMeOP), issued in February, 2012, lays down broad procedure for process management in the Central Secretariat. CSMeOP has a provision for carrying out compliance of the provisions of RTI Act before recording of the e-files. All Ministries/Departments/Offices are expected to upload the gist of important decisions on the website in compliance with the provisions of RTI Act.


    The procedure contained in CSMeOP are broad guidelines based on which each Ministry/Department issues its own Departmental instructions. DARPG does not centrally maintain any data/ information regarding following of provisions of CSMeOP by the Ministries/Departments.


    The revision of CSMeOP is being examined.
