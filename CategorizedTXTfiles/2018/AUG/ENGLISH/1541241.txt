    The Government has put in place a Centralised Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS ) which is an online centralized web application for redress of public grievances by various Central and State Government agencies and States. CPGRAMS facilitates the citizen to lodge grievance online and also view its current status, through citizen interface ( http://pgportal.gov.in ) of the application.


    The grievances can also be lodged through apex bodies like Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), President’s Secretariat, Directorate of Public Grievances (DPG) in Cabinet Secretariat and Department of Pension & Pensioners’ Welfare (DPPW), Government of India. Grievances from all these sources are received in the CPGRAMS at back end. Grievances can also be lodged through a Mobile App and grievances received through post are


    scanned and uploaded on the CPGRAMS. All Ministries/Departments are connected to CPGRAMS. Status of action taken on grievances is uploaded by all concerned on CPGRAMS.


    Number of grievances received and redressed in the past three months related to GOI as on 26/07/2018 at 5:30PM are as follows:
