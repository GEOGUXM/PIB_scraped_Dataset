This is the most significant book for our upcoming generation.”


    The Book titled “‘Untold Story of Broadcasting” written by Dr. Gautam Chatterjee is about behind-the-scenes developments during the quit India movement. It gives an authentic account of the secret broadcast which took place during the movement led by shri Ram Manohar Lohia.
