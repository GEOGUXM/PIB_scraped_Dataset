    The Central Statistics Office today released the estimates of GDP for the first quarter (Q1) of 2018-19. In line with momentum built in the economy, the growth of GDP in real terms in Q1 of 2018-19 is 8.2 per cent, reinforcing the high growth of 7.7 per cent recorded in last quarter of 2017-18. This growth is broad-based and has been driven by 8.4 per cent growth in consumption expenditure and 10.0 per cent growth in fixed investment. The latter development is particularly encouraging as it has come about over an impressive growth of 14.4 per cent in Q4 of 2017-18 and augurs well for future growth.


    A look at the GVA in different sector points towards the fact that the growth of agriculture sector in Q1 of 2018-19 was robust at 5.3 per cent on top of 4.5 per cent growth in Q4 of the previous financial year. The growth of manufacturing sector GVA picked up significantly to 13.5 per cent in Q1 of 2018-19, as against negative growth of 1.8 per cent in Q1 of 2017-18. The construction sector GVA growth was 8.7 per cent in Q1 of 2018-19, as compared to 1.8 per cent in Q1 of 2017-18. The services sector continued to do well, building up on growth achieved last year.


    All in all, despite some head-winds like higher crude oil prices, uncertainties on trade front due to protectionist tendencies in some countries, the Indian economy has performed well. We can expect the growth for the year as a whole to be very robust and India to be the fastest growing economy in the world.
