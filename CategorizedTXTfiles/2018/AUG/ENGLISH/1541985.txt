    The Central Government is fully alive and committed to implement its policy of “Zero Tolerance against Corruption” and has taken several measures to combat corruption.


    These, inter-alia, include:

      * Issue of Instructions by the CVC asking the organizations to adopt Integrity Pact in major procurement activities;
      * Ratification of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) in 2011;
      * Setting up of additional Special Courts exclusively for trial of CBI cases in different states.

    The pro-active measures taken by CVC to ensure that incorrect practices do not happen in future, are as follows:

      * Constant updating of the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) pertaining to each activity;
      * Setting up robust Whistle Blower Mechanism so that the officials functioning at various levels within the organisation get a channel to share their concerns related to vigilance/systemic issues without any fear;
      * Identify areas, where (i) there are no rules (ii) the rules that have potential of being misinterpreted or (iii) rules that are impossible to follow and advice framing suitable rules;
      * Formation of Preventive Vigilance Committees at Medium and Large Branches to discuss/review at monthly intervals preventive vigilance measures and frauds during the preceding month;
      * Need for devising an effective system for review of quality of concurrent audit by peer Chief Vigilance Officers;
      * Visits of medium and large branches by Vigilance Officers;
      * Offsite Surveillance through reports on various parameters e.g. spike in business levels, cash deposits, remittances, etc.
      * Effective and expeditious investigation whenever any irregularity/misconduct is noticed;
      * Organising of regular Training Programmes at various levels;

    Further, CVC guidelines are conveyed to all the Public Sector Banks (PSBs) from time to time for their meticulous compliance in the matter.PSBs regularly monitor their Systems & Procedures, Guidelines, Policies & Technology to incorporate suitable checks & balances in the system to curb corruption. PSBs have a Board approved Staff Accountability Policy and Regulations for taking action against officials involved in irregularities.
