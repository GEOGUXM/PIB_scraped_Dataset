    Government constantly reviews the security scenario and, accordingly, decides to induct appropriate defence equipment / technology to keep the Armed Forces in a state of readiness and equipped with modern weapon / protection systems.


    Acceptance of Necessities (AoNs) have been accorded for procurement of essential quantities of Assault Rifles through Fast Track Procedure (FTP) under ‘Buy (Global)’ category.


    The Capital Procurement proposals of the Armed Forces are progressed in terms of the extant Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP), which, inter alia, lays down timelines for various stages of the procurement process and all efforts are made to adhere to these laid down timelines.
