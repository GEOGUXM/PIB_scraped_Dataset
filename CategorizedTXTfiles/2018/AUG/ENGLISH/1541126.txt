    Central GST Delhi West Commissionerate arrested two Rohini based businessmen here in Delhi today in a case of fraudulent issuance of Input Tax Credit (ITC) invoices without actual supply of goods involving tax evasion of approximately Rs. 201 crore relating to Plastic Granule Industry.


    Searches were conducted at several places during which various incriminating documents and evidences were found. During investigation, it was revealed that the businessmen had floated multiple entities for issuing such fake invoices.
