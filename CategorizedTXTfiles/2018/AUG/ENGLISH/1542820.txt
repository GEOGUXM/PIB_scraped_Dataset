    The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh disclosed that Jammu will be the first city in North India to get a full-fledged Space Technology Research Centre, devoted to research, academics and post-graduation study. The Centre will function under the aegis of the Central University Jammu. In addition to Jammu, the other town selected for opening a Space Technology Research Centre is in the Northeast in Tripura, where it would function under the aegis of National Institute of Technology (NIT) Agartala. This was disclosed on the occasion of the beginning of year-long "Sarabhai Centenary" programmes of ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation), starting from today, that is, the 99 th birth anniversary of Dr Vikram Sarabhai, the first Chairman of ISRO and the founding father of India's Space Programme.


    Dr Jitendra Singh recalled that Dr Vikram Sarabhai always insisted on ISRO playing a meaningful role “nationally” and said it was a vindication that during the four years of the Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, we had succeeded in extending the Space related academic and research programmes to remote areas, which earlier had little exposure to the study of Space Technology.


    The Centres of Space Technology at Jammu and Tripura, Dr Jitendra Singh said, will offer a new opening and an opportunity for scholars and youngsters who have aptitude for Space science, to explore a new career and research option.


    Dr K Kasturirangan, Honorary Distinguished Advisor, ISRO in the presence of Dr K Sivan, Secretary, DOS / Chairman, ISRO, unveiled the bust of Dr Vikram A Sarabhai at Antariksh Bhavan, ISRO HQ today. He also delivered Sarabhai Memorial Talk. This was followed by Press briefing by Chairman, ISRO as a Curtain Raiser for the next year’s Vikram Sarabhai’s Birth Centenary Celebrations.
