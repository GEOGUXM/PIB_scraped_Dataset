    Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) organised a Regional Atal Pension Yojana (APY) Strategy cum Review Meeting for FY 2018-19 at Bengaluru yesterday for South Based Banks (Karnataka and Kerala) and DOP-Circles with an objective to discuss the target allocated for FY 2018-19 and the strategies adopted by the banks to achieve the same. More than 10 lacs accounts have been mobilized during FY 2018-19 and cumulative APY Subscriber Base is 1.09 cr.


    It is empahised that PFRDA has enabled several online features to facilitate subscribers to access their Account without visiting the Bank/Post Branch. These features are expected to benefit APY Subscribers and empower them to carry-out Account related activities as described below.


      * Grievance Module

      * APY Upgrade View / Downgrade View
      * APY ePRAN card/ Statement View
      * Aadhaar Seeding
      * APY@eNPS
      * Mobile Application

    APY SPs need to maintain the persistency levels as well of the accounts along with fresh sourcing to be eligible for persistency incentive and ensuring adequacy of corpus for the subscriber.


    PFRDA appreciates the efforts taken-out by the APY Service Providers (Banks/DoP) throughout the year and during the campaigns (Incredible leadership/ Passion for Performance/Splendid Seven) for their contribution towards making India a Pensioned Society.
