      Posted On: 09 AUG 2018 6:50PM by PIB Delhi


    Central Government through various schemes under Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP), now called as Scheduled Tribe Component (STC) provides funds to State Governments including Rajasthan for tribal development. Earmarking of funds under TSP were done by the concerned Ministries / Departments against their Plan allocation under the broad strategies of Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) as per the criteria recommended by the Task Force, 2010 constituted by the erstwhile Planning Commission under the Chairmanship of Dr. Narendra Jadhav. The Task Force had recommended for differential earmarking i.e. earmarking at different rates by a total of 28 Ministries / Departments and only against their plan outlay. After merger of Plan and Non-Plan, Ministry of Finance revised percentage for earmarking of STC funds for the Central Ministries / Department in the month of December 2016 and included two new Central Ministries i.e. Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship and Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DONER). The matter of earmarking of funds has further been deliberated upon by the NITI Aayog and Ministry of Finance and the allocation percentages for different Ministries / Departments have been revisited in 2017-18. Details of allocation and expenditure under STC during last three financial years and current year is given below:

    # Provisional figures * as on 06.08.18


    As per Census 2011, total Scheduled Tribe (ST) population in Rajasthan is 0.92 crore which is 8.84% of the total ST population in the country i.e. 10.45 crore. During 2017-18, out of a total of Rs. 30020.25 crore released to all the States, an amount of Rs. 2388.92 crore has been provided to the State of Rajasthan which is 8.01%.


    Implementation of the schemes under STC is the responsibility of respective Central Ministries Departments. Utilization of funds by the State is a continuous process and utilization certificate, if due, is obtained from the States as per provisions contained in General Financial Rules prior to release of further funds. Details of utilization of STC funds by the State Governments are not centrally maintained. In the year 2017, Allocation of Business Rules (ABR) has been amended whereby Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) has been given mandate for monitoring of STC funds allocation and release based on the framework and mechanism designed by NITI Aayog. Accordingly, an online monitoring system has been put in place by the Ministry with web address http://stcmis.gov.in since 2017. The framework captures data directly from Public Finance Management System (PFMS) and gives inputs regarding expenditure vis-a- vis allocations by Central Ministries / Departments. A customized proforma has also been introduced recently in the said online system to monitor physical progress of work. Further, nodal officers have been nominated in each of the line Ministries / Departments for coordination and monitoring. Meetings with nodal officers are held periodically to review Ministry / Department-wise performance.
