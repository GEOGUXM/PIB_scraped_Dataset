      Posted On: 06 AUG 2018 4:20PM by PIB Delhi


    A driver working under any establishment or process or factory in which the employed persons are more than 10, will be entitled to get the benefits of Employees’ State Insurance and a driver working under any establishment or factory in which the employed persons are more than 20, will also get the benefits of Provident fund.


    In order to provide social security benefits to the workers in the unorganised sector, the Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008 has been enacted to provide welfare schemes in matters relating to life and disability cover, health and maternity benefits, old age protection to the unorganised workers. Various Ministries/Departments of the Central Government are implementing such social security schemes like Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme (Ministry of Rural Development); National Family Benefit Scheme (Ministry of Rural Development); health and maternity schemes (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare). The Central Government is also implementing Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) to provide life and disability coverage to the unorganised workers depending upon their eligibility. There is no proposal at present regarding Sarathi Suraksha Card.


    This information was given by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar Union Minister of State (I/C) for Labour and Employment in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
