      Posted On: 10 AUG 2018 3:45PM by PIB Delhi


    With a view to develop freight terminals through private investment, Ministry of Railways has launched following schemes –


    Private Siding – The private siding policy enables rail connectivity at party’s doorstep i.e. factory premises and raw material producing areas, and also connects manufacturing hubs with markets across the country.


    Private Freight Terminal (PFT) Scheme – The scheme facilitates rapid development of a network of freight terminals with private investment to provide efficient and cost effective logistics services with warehousing solution to end users.


    These schemes are aimed to increase the freight loading and revenue generation on Indian Railways. The growth in volume of traffic and revenue is dependent on factors like Originating-Destination station pairs, customer requirement, growth in the number of such terminals, transportation requirement in the prevailing economic conditions etc.


    This information was given by the Minister of State of Railways, Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
