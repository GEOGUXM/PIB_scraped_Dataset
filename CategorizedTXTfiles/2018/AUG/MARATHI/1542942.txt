Her daunting stamina stems from her early training as a recruit in Subhash Chandra Bose's Indian National Army (INA). A Second Lieutenant belonging to the Rani Jhansi regiment in Rangoon in Burma, Smt. Khandwala spent her days marching, hoisting flags, learning how to wield a rifle, a bayonet and the Bren Machine Gun.
