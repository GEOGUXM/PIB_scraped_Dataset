    For the second successive day, the Indian Navy has pressed into service its ships and aircraft to search and locate missing crew of fishing boat Oceanic that was struck by an unidentified ship yesterday early morning at high seas about 24 miles off Munambam Harbour. Indian Naval Ship Jamuna continued the search around the reported position of the incident throughout the night and is currently still in the area. Naval Dornier aircraft were launched early this morning to augment the ongoing search efforts. Helicopters, (Seaking and ALH) have also been operating in the area to search for missing fishermen. The air search found a 10 metre capsized boat in the area which has been identified as ‘Al Ma Rahan’. INS Sunayna, an Offshore Patrol Vessel, with a full-fledged naval diving team embarked, also sailed this morning to join the rescue effort. No missing persons have been located as yet. The search area is being realigned to cater for the drift in the sea in that area. The Navy will continue its search and rescue efforts.
