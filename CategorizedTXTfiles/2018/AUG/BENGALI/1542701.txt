    Senior media experts and administrative officials agreed upon an urgent need of special coverage facilities for working-journalists executing their duties in sensitive regions, such as the Chicken’s Neck and Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Sikkim and other hilly areas. This consensus emerged at a day-long workshop for media held in Darjeeling today. The district-level event, Vartalap, was organized by Union Government’s media agency, Press Information Bureau (PIB), Kolkata.


    Deputy Director, PIB, Kolkata, Shri Ajay Mhamia lauded the efforts and toil of the regional journalists while executing their professional duty. The print and electronic scribes in this region are performing very well despite the hindrances faced on the civilian front, Shri Mhamia said.


    Veteran journalists and editors, including the President of Darjeeling Press Club, Shri Sanjay Biswas and Shri Prabir Paramanik, Shri S B Sunwar and Shri Pulakesh Ghosh discussed various issues of the journalists. Scribes including a large number of media persons from Mirik, Kurseong and the neighbouring district of Kalimpong demanded special accreditation and also social welfare measures from the Union Government. Shri Rudra Karki, Vice President of Kalimpong Press Club said most of the media representatives are working since many years in hostile condition without a Press Card.


    Smt Chitra Gupta, Deputy Director, PIB thanked journalists for their overwhelming participation in the interactive programme. She also conducted the event. An audio visual session was also held on media facilities provided by PIB.
