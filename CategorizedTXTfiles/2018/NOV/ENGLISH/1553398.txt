      Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


      Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:


      1.1 Crude oil production by ONGC during October, 2018 was 1765.43 TMT which is 9.58%lower than the monthly target and6.56%lower when compared with October, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-October, 2018 was 12441.53TMT which is 5.54%lower than target for the period andlowerby 5.68% thanproduction during corresponding period of last year. Reason for shortfall are as under:


      Ø ESP problem in wells of NBP field. Rig deployment commenced post monsoon for rectification works.


      Ø Loss from WO-16 and B-127 fields in the absence of MOPUs Sagar Samrat and Sagar Laxmi.


      Ø Sub-sea leakage in some well fluid lines of Mumbai High & Neelam Heera Asset, leading to flow restriction.


      1.2 Crude oil production by OIL during October, 2018 was283.02 TMT which is 12.19%lower than monthly target and 1.35% lower when compared with October, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-October, 2018 was 1968.70 TMT which is 6.94% lower than target for the period and0.62% lower than production during the corresponding period of last year. Major reason for lower production is less than planned contribution from work over wells and drilling wells.


      1.3 Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during October, 2018 was 836.75 TMT which is 3.13% lower than the monthly target and2.89%lowerthanOctober, 2017.Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-October, 2018 was 5884.36TMT which is 1.88%lowerthan target for the period and marginally lower by0.11% than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reason for shortfall are as under:


      Ø RJ-ON-90/1: Around 60 oil wells are closed due to various reasons like high water cut, require WOJ, etc. 32 wells are closed due to liquid handling constraint at MPT plant (CEIL).


      Ø Panna-Mukta: Underperformance of wells post unplanned shutdown in July’18. (SHELL).


      2.Natural Gas


      Natural gas production during October, 2018 was 2797.67 MMSCM which is 7.05% lower than the target for the month and marginally lower by 0.38% when compared with October, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production during April-October, 2018 was 19051.95MMSCM which is 7.64% lower than target for the period and0.88% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year.Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II . Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of October, 2018 and cumulatively for the period April-October, 2018 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

      Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production


      2.1 Natural gas production by ONGC during October, 2018 was 2110.39 MMSCM which is 5.12% lower than the monthly targetbut 4.60% higher when compared with October, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC duringApril-October, 2018 was 14127.86MMSCM which is 5.87% lower than the cumulative target but3.18% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year. Some of the reasons for shortfall against monthly target are as under:


      Ø Less than planned gas production from WO-16 and B-127 fields in the absence of MOPUs Sagar Samrat and Sagar Laxmi.


      Ø Decline of pressure/potential in GS-4 gas cap reservoir in Gandhar.


      2.2 Natural gas production by OIL during October, 2018 was 235.48 MMSCM which is 13.17% lower than the monthly targetand3.19% lower than October, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-October, 2018 was 1601.27 MMSCM which is 13.96% lower than the cumulative target and7.15% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year.The reason for monthly target shortfall is due to loss of well head production potential of high producing wells of Deohal area, due to downhole tubing corrosion. Work over operations are in progress to revive the wells.


      2.3 Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during October, 2018 was 451.79 MMSCM which is 12.15% lower than the monthly target and17.50% lower when compared with October, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-October, 2018 was 3322.83MMSCM which is 11.62% lower than the cumulative target and12.65% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      • KG-DWN-98/3: MA field ceased production from 18.09.2018. Closure of 3 wells in D1D3 field. Well A20 ceased to flow in D1D3 field from 23.10.2018. (RIL)


      • RJ-ON/6: Less offtake by buyer. Low gas production due to stuck up in two wells. (FEL)

      Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production


      3.1 CPSE Refineries’ production during October, 2018 was 12938.81TMT which is 1.31%lower than the target for the month but2.54%higher when compared with October, 2017. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-October, 2018 was 87733.93 TMT which is 1.64% higher than the target for the period and 5.97% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


      Ø IOCL, Guwahati: Throughput is lower due toplanned M&I shutdown.


      Ø IOCL, Gujarat: Throughput is lower due tolower NG crude receipt and AU-1 interruption.


      Ø IOCL, Paradip: Throughputis lower due to high coke stock leading to lower DCU capacity utilization and lower crude throughput.


      Ø HPCL, Mumbai: Throughputis lower due to fresh water supply constraint from source.


      Ø CPCL, Manali: Throughputis lower than target due to M&I shutdown of CDU-2 / FCCU, which was originally scheduled during July / Aug'18.


      3.2 Production in JV refineries during October, 2018 was 1159.32TMT which is 16.17% lower than the target for the month but 28.05% lowerwhen compared with October, 2017. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-October, 2018 was 9878.30TMT which is 4.0% higher than the target for the period and22.0%higherthan the production during corresponding period of last year.Reason for shortfall in throughput is due to progressive commissioning of secondary processing units post refinery turnaround of BORL in Aug-Oct’2018.


      3.3 Production in private refineries during October, 2018 was 7784.93TMT which is higherby 3.41% than the target for the month but1.18% lowerwhen compared with October, 2017. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-October, 2018 was 52928.79 TMT which is 1.35% higher than the target for the period butlowerby 1.47% compared to production during corresponding period of last year.


        3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of October, 2018 and cumulatively for the period April-October, 2018 vis-à-vis April-October, 2017 are given at Annexures -IV and V respectively.
