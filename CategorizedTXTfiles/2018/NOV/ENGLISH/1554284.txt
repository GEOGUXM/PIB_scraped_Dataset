    Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Dr Ambedkarâ€™s long struggle for equality, constitutionalism and fraternity established him as a national icon. He received immense affection and respect because he communicated hope, self-confidence and self-esteem among traditionally disadvantaged communities and groups.
