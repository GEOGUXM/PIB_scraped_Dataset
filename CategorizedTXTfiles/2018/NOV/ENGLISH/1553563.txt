      Posted On: 22 NOV 2018 5:46PM by PIB Delhi


    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind has sent his greetings to fellow citizens on the eve of birthday of Guru Nanak Dev.


    In a message, the President has said, “ Remembering the life and teachings of Guru Nanak Dev, I offer my greetings and good wishes on this sacred occasion to all my fellow citizens, including members of the Sikh community.


    The life of Guru Nanak Dev teaches us love and harmony. He gave us the mantra of ‘Ek Omkar Satnam’, which means that there is only One God.


    While emphasising values of love, peace and compassion, Guru Nanak Dev equated service to humanity with service to God. His preachings such as “Vand Chako – sharing with others, Kirat Karo – making an honest living and, Naam Japo- Remembering God at all times” capture the essence of his message.


    Let us resolve to follow the path shown by Guru Nanak Dev and work for the welfare of the society”.
