    Prompt action taken by POWERGRID has brought back the valleyâ€™s power to normalcy which was affected by the heavy snowfall in the late evening of 3 rd November, 2018 and morning of 4 th November, 2018. The 1600 MW normal load of power in J&K is being fulfilled in the state presently.


    Heavy snowfall in areas of Jammu and Kashmir threw the normal life out of gear in the state as people suffered immensely due to power breakdown in the valley.


    Both POWERGRID transmission lines namely 400 kV Double Circuit New Wanpoh-Kishenpur and 400 kV Double Circuit New Wanpoh-Wagoora tripped in the morning of 4 th November, 2018. As soon as the fault was noticed, quick action was taken by POWERGRID immediately and all POWERGRID lines were restored within a span of about half an hour.


    During the snowfall, three JK-PDD lines namely 132 kV Mir Bazar-Kulgam, 132 kV Mir Bazar-Lisser, 132 kV Lassipora-Shopian were also affected due to failure of towers. The local level restoration of transmission lines is being done by JK-PDD and POWERGRID jointly. POWERGRID is providing all required support along with expert manpower for quick restoration by deploying Emergency Restoration System (ERS). Power is now available in the valley and affected JK-PDD transmission lines are being restored proactively.
