    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, reached Sydney, Australia, today (November 21, 2018) for the final leg of his two-nation state visit to Vietnam and Australia. This is the first state visit to Australia by a President of India.


    Later in the day, the President attended an Indian community reception hosted by Dr Ajay M Gondane, High Commissioner of India to Australia. Addressing the gathering, the President said it is a matter of pride that the Indian community is held in high regard and contributes to society and the economy in Australia. Today, Indian professionals are much sought after, whether in Australia or elsewhere in the world. As entrepreneurs, doctors, teachers, bankers and technology specialists, members of the Indian community are adding value to Australia.


    The President said that Australia is also home to a large number of Indian students. They are excelling on campuses in academics and research, in fostering innovation and even on the sports field. Their hard work and talent is a symbol of the Australia-India Knowledge Partnership.


    Earlier President Kovind formally began his visit by paying respects at the ANZAC War Memorial in Sydney. The Memorial was originally built as a tribute to Australian soldiers who did service in World War I. In his subsequent engagement with the Indian community, the President made special mention of Indian soldiers who fought alongside their Australian comrades in World War I, including on the beaches of Gallipoli. The centenary of the conclusion of World War I was commemorated earlier this month.
