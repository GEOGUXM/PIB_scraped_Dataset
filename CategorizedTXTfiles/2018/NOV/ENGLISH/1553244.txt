    Continuing with its efforts to clean the river Yamuna, National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) organized a Cleanliness drive at the Kalindi Kunj Ghat in New Delhi today. NMCG Director General Shri Rajiv Ranjan Mishra led his team along with South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) and local stakeholders in the drive in the early hours. The Ghat was made pristine and free from plastic and other solid wastes.


    This is the fifth time in the past few months that NMCG has organised a cleanliness drive at Kalindi Kunj Ghat. Cleaning of Yamuna is part of the Namami Gange programme as it is the tributary of River Ganga.
