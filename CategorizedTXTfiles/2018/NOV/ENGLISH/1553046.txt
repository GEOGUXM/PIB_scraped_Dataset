    A wreath laying ceremony was organised today at the Teen Murti Memorial by the Cavalry Officers’ Association, to honour the sacrifices, valour, and splendid contribution of the Indian Cavalry since World War I. The Indian Cavalry has a long and awe-inspiring history of valour and sacrifice.


    Teen Murti memorial was instituted in the memory of the cavalry officers, non commissioned officers and men of the 15 th Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade composed of cavalry regiments from the Indian states of Hyderabad, Mysore and Jodhpur, with detachments from Bhavnagar, Kashmir and Kathiawar who were martyred in the Great War of 1914-1919, in the Sinai, Palestine and Syria. The Armoured Corps, a successor and inheritor of the cavalry traditions has proven to be the spear of the Indian military might with its mighty T-72, Arjun and T-90 tanks.


    The memorial service was a solemn ceremony of poise and grace wherein wreaths were placed by serving and retired officers of the cavalry fraternity.


    Lt Gen Amit Sharma (Retd), President COA, highlighted the great contribution of the Indian Armoured Corps, in protecting the nation’s sovereignty. This is aptly reflected by the ‘Gallantry Awards’ earned by the Corps since independence, which include two Param Vir Chakras, 16 Mahavir Chakras, Three Kirti Chakras, 57 Vir Chakras and 26 Shaurya Chakras.
