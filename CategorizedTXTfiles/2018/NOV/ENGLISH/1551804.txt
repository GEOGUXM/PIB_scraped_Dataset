      Speaking on the Occasion, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan said that this MoU will help in filling the gaps in reaching the rural and far-flung areas, by appropriate use of the technology and harnessing the enterprising spirit of the people of India. He said that digital platforms have been successfully used in the schemes of DBTL in de-duplication of the LPG connections and Pradhan Mantri Ujjawala Yojana (PMUY) in release of 5.75 Crore Ujjawala connections in just two and half years. The Minister said that CSCs work at the grass root level and will help in reaching the people at the bottom of the pyramid. He said that the pilot scheme is already running and he expects to involve over 1 lakh CSCs, particularly in rural area, in next 2-3 months. Describing the CSCs as the change agents, he said that they will help in booking and delivery of LPG cylinders and booking of new connections. He informed that in the PMUY, 80% refillings are being done.


      Congratulating the partners in the MoU, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad said that this is an apt example of Digital inclusion, using technology for the benefit of the common man. He said that the number of CSCs has increased almost 4 fold in last four and half years, and it is offering a bouquet of services, providing direct benefit to the common man, largely in non-metro areas. The Minister said that India has passion for technology and now that eco system and opportunities are being provided, results and changes are happening.
