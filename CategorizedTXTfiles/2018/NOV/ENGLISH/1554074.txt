      Posted On: 27 NOV 2018 8:59PM by PIB Delhi


    The Security Restrictions Guidelines enunciated by Ministry of Defence on 31.10.1990, were restrictive in nature towards developmental activities near border areas. In supersession of all previous orders, fresh guidelines were issued on 27.11.2017 on security restrictions of construction activities in Border areas which are also not fully facilitating construction/developmental works of small nature in Border areas.


    Keeping in view the requests of State Governments, that construction/developmental works in border areas are getting affected due to provisions listed in the MoDâ€™s existing guidelines, Government of India has decided to allow the developmental works of small nature like construction, repair and maintenance of village ponds, construction and maintenance of Government Buildings like Schools, Hospitals etc by Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and other Central/State Government Statutory bodies for faster development in border areas.


    Security considerations for construction activities/other activities in border areas/ other areas issued earlier from time to time by Ministry of Defence shall not be applicable for the above mentioned development works in border areas.
