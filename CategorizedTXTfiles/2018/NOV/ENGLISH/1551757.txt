    The unfortunate incident of run over by a train at Amritsar leading to several deaths and injuries has become a matter of great public discourse especially raising concerns regarding safety of persons trespassing on railway tracks. Shri Gurjeet Singh Aujla, Hon’ble MP from Amritsar met Hon’ble Minister of Railways & Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal and personally handed over his letter dated 23.10.2018 and requested for an inquiry by Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) in this incident. Ministry of Railways has considered this request and other facts, circumstances and legal provisions. As per law, in such cases, it is not mandatory to conduct inquiry by Chief Commissioner of Railway Safety (CCRS), but it is not impermissible either. In past, CRS inquiry was conducted in an incident of run over of persons on railway tracks. Though, prima facie, Railways does not appear to be responsible in this incident, issue of inquiry by an independent and technically competent authority not reporting to Ministry of Railways was considered and request was made to CCRS to conduct an inquiry in this matter. Considering this, Chief Commissioner of Railway Safety (CCRS), Lucknow has ordered statutory inquiry into this incident.
