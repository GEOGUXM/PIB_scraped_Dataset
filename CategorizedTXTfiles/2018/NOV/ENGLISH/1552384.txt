      The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has paid tributes to the Indian soldiers who fought in the First World War.
      "Today, as we mark one hundred years since the end of the horrific First World War, we reiterate our commitment towards world peace and pledge to work to further an atmosphere of harmony and brotherhood so that the trail of death and destruction caused by wars does not occur.
      India remembers our brave soldiers who fought in WW-1. This was a war in which India was not directly involved yet our soldiers fought world over, just for the cause of peace.
      I have had the honour of paying tributes at the Neuve-Chapelle Memorial in France and at the memorial in Israel's Haifa, places associated with India's role in the First World War. When PM Benjamin Netanyahu came to India, we paid tributes at the Teen Murti-Haifa Chowk", the Prime Minister said.
