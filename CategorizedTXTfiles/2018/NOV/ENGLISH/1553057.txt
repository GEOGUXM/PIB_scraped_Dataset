    Following is the text of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi's departure statement prior to his visit to Maldives


    “I am delighted to visit Malé, the capital of the Republic of Maldives, our close and friendly neighbour, to attend the historic Inauguration Ceremony of President-elect H.E. Ibrahim Mohamed Solih.


    I warmly congratulate him on his victory in the recent elections. It represents the collective aspirations of the people of the Republic of Maldives for democracy, rule of law and a prosperous future.


    India and The Maldives share a strong partnership rooted in history, strong bonds between our peoples, and their shared aspiration for peace and prosperity. My Government's vision of inclusive development 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas' extends to all our neighbours too. We in India strongly desire to see a democratic, prosperous and peaceful Republic of Maldives.


    I will convey to the new Maldivian Government of Mr. Solih the desire of my Government to work closely for realisation of their developmental priorities, especially in areas of infrastructure, health care, connectivity and human resource development.


    I am confident that my visit will herald a new era of even closer exchanges and cooperation between our two countries”.
