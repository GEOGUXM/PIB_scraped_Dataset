On this occasion, Lt Gen SK Shrivastava, Engineer-in-Chief and all senior serving and retired offrs laid wreaths and paid homage to the braves in a solemn ceremony at Amar Jawan Jyoti.

    The Corps of Engineers provides combat engineering support, develops infrastructure for armed forces and other defence organisations, maintains lines of communication along India's borders and provides relief to populace during natural disasters. These tasks are executed through four pillars of the Corps – Combat Engineers, Military Engineering Service, Border Roads Organisation and Military Survey.


    The raising day is celebrated to commemorate the raising of the first engineering company in 1780. The modern day Corps of Engineers has three groups: Madras Sappers, Bengal Sappers and Bombay Sappers which were amalgamated into the Corps on 18 Nov 1932.
