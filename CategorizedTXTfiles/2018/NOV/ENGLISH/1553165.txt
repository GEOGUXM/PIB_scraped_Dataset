    (i) The Deep Depression over Southeast Arabian Sea moved westwards with a speed of 22 kmph during past 06 hours, weakened into a depression and lay centered at 1130 hrs IST of today, the 19 th November, 2018 over Southeast Arabian Sea near latitude 11.2°N and longitude 65.8°E, about 730 km west-northwest of Agatti and 1300 km east-southeast of Socotra. It is likely to move nearly westwards and weaken into a well marked low pressure area during next 48 hours.


    (ii) The well marked low pressure area over central parts of south Bay of Bengal persisted over the same region at 1130 hours IST of today, the 19 th November, 2018. It is very likely to move westwards and is likely to intensify into a depression over southwest Bay of Bengal during next 24 hours .
