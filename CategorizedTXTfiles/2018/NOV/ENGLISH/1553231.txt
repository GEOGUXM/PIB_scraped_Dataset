      Posted On: 19 NOV 2018 8:02PM by PIB Delhi


    Governor of Haryana Mr. Satyadev Narayan Arya Ji, the popular Chief Minister of Haryana Mr. Manohar Lal Ji Khattar, my cabinet colleagues Chaudhary Virendra Singh ji and Rao Inderjit Singh ji; all the ministers of the state government, some are sitting here and some are sitting there; and my dear brothers and sisters of Haryana who are present here in large numbers.


    Just now, the Chief Minister of Haryana was telling that I had got the opportunity to be present amongst you several times; and now I have come once again just within a short span of time. The last time when I had come here, I had got the opportunity to inaugurate the huge statue of Chaudhary Chhotu Ram ji. This statue is the symbol of Haryana's pride. Today, once again, I am in Haryana. The state has received more than Rs.3300 crores. Today Haryana has taken another robust step towards all-round development.


    Friends,


    There is not only light of knowledge but also stories of courage on the land of Haryana. Yesterday marked 56th anniversary of Ladakh's Rezangla Pass war that took place at a height of 18000 feet. The sons of Haryana under the leadership of Param Vir Chakra awardee Major Shaitan Singh had fought valiantly in the battle. Many of the martyrs belonged to this region of Haryana. They had shown everyone that Haryana stands for courage, patience and intelligence. I pay tribute to the brave soldiers of the country who died on the Rezang La Post, and I salute them.


    Friends,


    This day is extremely significant for Haryana. I have got the opportunity to dedicate the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal expressway to the nation. The first phase was completed two years ago. The second phase, 83km long stretch from Kundli to Manesar has been launched today. With this, the 135km long expressway is now ready. At the same time, the Ballabhgarh-Mujesar metro line built at a cost of Rs.500 crores has also been started. These two projects will bring a revolution in connectivity in this region and at the same time the youth of this region will get a boost through Shri Vishvakarma Kaushal University.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Today's event calls for comparing two scenarios. One is that of the present which says that when we do something with a resolution, it gets fulfilled. This scenario represents the work culture and modus operandi of the governments of Bharatiya Janata Party. The second scenario depicts the work culture of the previous government and constantly reminds us of that. You should have got the expressway 8-9 years ago. However, that was not the case. The work culture of the previous government stretched the work of expressway for 12 years.


    Friends,


    This expressway was supposed to be ready during the Commonwealth Games. But whatever has happened to the Commonwealth Games, the same is the fate of this expressway. I clearly remember that when I started reviewing the project in the PRAGATI meetings, several lapses were detected. The continuous follow-up by the central government and the acceleration in the work after the BJP government came to power in Haryana resulted in this day. It ended the age-old wait.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Just imagine, halting and suspending the work had caused a great loss to the people of Haryana and the entire Delhi NCR. The way the previous government worked is a case study that depicts how the public money is wasted and how injustice is inflicted upon the public. At the inception of this project, the estimated cost was Rs.1200 crores. After all these years, the cost has escalated by more than three times. If this work of peripheral expressway was completed on time, the traffic scenario in Delhi would have been different. With this expressway, the compulsion of the heavy vehicles coming from other states to pass through Delhi will end. The traffic will pass through the outskirts without entering Delhi or affecting its traffic. With this expressway, the number of vehicles entering Delhi will considerably fall.


    Friends,


    This expressway will play an important role to reduce the pollution in Delhi and nearby locations. In a way, this expressway will boost the idea of ease of living and ease of travelling along with the economy and environment. I congratulate the people of Haryana and Delhi NCR for this expressway. A network of the expressway with a length of 270km has been completed around Delhi.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Today Mujesar has been connected to Ballabhgarh through metro rail. Now Ballabhgarh too is on the metro map. This will not only help the people here to travel to Delhi but also save their time and money.


    Friends,


    Our government considers connectivity to be not only a need but also a medium of country's development, security and empowerment. We are making efforts to build such an infrastructure of road connectivity, rail connectivity, water connectivity, highway connectivity and I-way connectivity that meets the needs of the 21st century and supports each other. Right now, work is underway at an unprecedented rate across the country on several railway corridors and highway corridors. In several cities of the country, work is underway for an Integrated Traffic Management System at a rapid pace. We are working towards ensuring less travel time for the people, reducing traffic jams and access to alternative modern and cheap modes of transport for the industries. Along with all these efforts, we also try to ensure preservation of the environment. For this, such modes of transport are being promoted that will help in reducing pollution. The extension of electric rail lines and developing resources for electric cars are taking us towards this direction.


    Friends,


    We have focused upon speed for the new generation infrastructure in the country. In the last four years, the government has constructed highways with a total length of more than 33000km at a cost of Rs.3 lakh crores. We have constructed more highways in just four years compared to the highways constructed by the previous government in 7.5 years.


    Friends,


    The people, the workers, the offices and the files are the same but when we are willing and determined, then any goal can be accomplished. This is the reason why prior to 2014, the highway was constructed at a rate of 12km per day. Today it is 27km per day. At this pace, under the Bharatmala project, the work for constructing 35000km of highways is going on at a rapid pace. The work is underway at a rapid pace not only in case of the highways but also for the railway connectivity. A network of railway is being established in the areas that didn't even have railway lines; railways lines are being extended in the areas wherever required.


    Friends,


    Our government has always taken into consideration the requirements of the country and the hopes and aspirations of the people. Accordingly, the speed of the trains is being increased; the trains and the stations are being modernized. You must have seen that even the modern train without an engine is now all set to run on the tracks in India. This train is enhancing the sheen of Make in India.


    Brothers and sisters,


    The government is also emphasizing on optimum utilization of the country's human resource and water resources. More than 100 waterways are being constructed in the country. Just a few days ago, the country's first cargo container reached Varanasi through riverine route. Now goods are being transported on ships sailing on the Banares-Haldia waterway. UP is now linked to the Northeastern states through Mother Ganga. Simultaneously, the UDAN scheme is in operation for making air travel cheaper in the country. An airport has been constructed here in Hisar so that it gets connected with the UDAN scheme. Brothers and sisters, because of government’s policies, the common man now can travel by flights.


    Friends,


    Under Digital India Mission, the work of connecting the Panchayats with Broadband is progressing at a rapid pace. Please keep in mind that the previous government connected only 59 Panchayats with Optical Fibre Network in four years, whereas our government linked more than 1 lakh Panchayats with Optical Fibre Network in four years. Only fifty-nine on the one hand, and 1 lakh on the other!


    Friends,


    Growing connectivity also brings several new employment opportunities. The benefits of this entire ecosystem like construction of highways, metro or rail or development of waterways help in transport, construction, manufacturing and services sectors. I am glad that the government of Haryana is not only providing new employment opportunities to the youth but also emphasizing upon preparing them for the changing ways of employment. Laying the foundation stone of the Shri Vishvakarma Kaushal University is a major step in this direction. This University will provide skill training to the youth of Haryana as per the changing nature of jobs. This University will provide the education and empowerment to the youngsters to start their own business. I sincerely hope that with the blessings of Lord Vishwakarma, the god of skill, the path of the future will be easier for the students of this University.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Today, Haryana is one of the leading states in terms of exports. Of these, more than 22000 small scale industries and the MSMEs have made a significant contribution. This Kaushal University will strengthen the MSME sector of this region. The students passed out of this University will produce goods with the principle of Zero Defect Zero Effect and will enhance the sheen of Make in India.


    Friends,


    You must be aware of the fact that recently 12 major decisions have been taken to promote the MSME sector. Now my small businessmen of Haryana associated with the GST will easily get loans of up to Rs.1 crore in just 59 minutes. Besides, many decisions have been taken to increase the production, to increase the scope of the market and for its easy operation.


    Brothers and sisters,


    This government wants to empower the country's entrepreneurs and is pushing the youngsters towards industry through innovation. It is taking care of the fact that their concept shall not fail to get the support of capital. Stand-up India and Start-up India have been implemented keeping this idea in mind. Just because of this idea, the youngsters of the country have been given loans of Rs. 6 lakh 70 thousand crores without bank guarantee under the MUDRA Yojana. Most importantly, more than 70% of the loan raisers through the MUDRA Yojana are women. This scheme, in a way, has become a major medium of women’s self-employment and certainly my daughters and sisters of Haryana are also getting the benefits of this scheme.


    Friends,


    Our government is relentlessly working to make the lives of the women easier. Be it the Swacch Bharat Mission that built 9 crore toilets; or the Ujjwala Yojana that provided approximately 6 crore gas connections, both have made the lives of the women easier. Haryana too has fully cooperated with the central government to promote its vision. The success of ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' campaign and Khelo India is the greatest example of this. The largest numbers of medals are being grabbed by the sons and the daughters of this state. Be it the Commonwealth Games or the Asiad, the victorious bugle of the daughters and youngsters of Haryana can be heard across the world.


    Brothers and sisters,


    The BJP governments, of the centre and the states; of Haryana or Rajasthan, MP or Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh or northeastern India, is working with the mantra of Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'. The outcome is quiet discernible today at a great level. I am glad that the people of Haryana are actively collaborating in all these efforts. Once again I congratulate you all for the foundation stone laying ceremony and dedication to the nation of the Western Peripheral Expressway, Metro and Skill University. Thank you very much!
