    ISRO has planned twelve to fourteen launch missions in the year 2019, which includes Chandrayaan –II. Speaking to media after the successful launch of PSLV C-43 today, Dr. K.Sivan, Chairman, ISRO, said India’s modern earth observation satellite HysIS and 30 foreign co-passenger satellites were placed in the determined orbits.


    He said, the main purpose of the HysIS is to exactly identify the objects on the surface of the earth with high precision and resolution. HysIS will start sending the images from the fifth day of the injection, he added.


    With HysIS, we have 47 operational satellites that are active now in their orbits, meant for applications like communications, earth observation, scientific studies and navigation.


    Speaking on the Gaganyaan, he said the process is going in the right directionand ISRO is planning to launch the first unmanned missionas a precursor to Gaganyaan by December 2020, followed by one more mission by July 2021. He further added that ISRO plans to accomplish the manned mission by December, 2021.


    When asked why GSAT-11is being launched from French Guiana, Director, U R Rao Satellite Centre, P. Kunhikrishnan saidGSAT-11 weighing 5.86 ton cannot be carried by the GSLVMk – III which has the capacity to lift only up to four-ton class payloads. Though its capacity is being augmented gradually to carry much heavier satellites, the national space agency has to go in for launches from abroad to meet the current requirement.
