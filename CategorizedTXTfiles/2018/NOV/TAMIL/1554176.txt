    ISRO to launch its heaviest satellite, GSAT-11 on Dec 5, 2018, at 2.08 am from French Guiana. Dr. Sivan Chairman ISRO said this while addressing the scientist after the completion of the launch of PSLV C-43 successfully, which had one indigenously build HysIS satellite and 30 foreign co-passenger Satellites.


    He said within 15 days of its previous launch, ISRO today has undertaken another launch. In the month of December, ISRO has planned two more launches, GSAT 11 from French Guiana and GSAT 7A from Sriharikota. Next year, ISRO will have its long expected second mission to moon, Chandrayaan – II, expected in the month of January.


    While congratulating the ISRO scientist, he said it is a very proud moment to the nation as the HysIS, launched by PSLV C43, was indigenously designed and built. He also thanked the foreign countries for posing faith in India to launch their Satellites. With today’s success, India has launched 269 foreign satellites.
