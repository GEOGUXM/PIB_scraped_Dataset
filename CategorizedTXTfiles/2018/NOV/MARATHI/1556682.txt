    About the ICFT UNESCO GANDHI MEDAL


    The UNESCO issued commemorative medal in 1994, marking the 125th anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi, the world’s advocate of peace, tolerance and non-violence. The medal bears a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi engraved by the French artist Pierre-Yves Tremois. Engraved underneath is the Mahatma’s message of hope ‘In the midst of darkness light prevails’. The reverse side carries the UNESCO Logo. The coveted award is given to the


    film that best reflects Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals of peace, tolerance and non-violence.


    The award will be announced at the closing ceremony of IFFI 2018.
