    Government wants to give highest priority to infrastructure.To realise New India dream of Prime Minister Narendra Modi National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is constructing new Highways and new routes, said Minister of Road Transport and Highways and Shipping while starting second bundle of Toll-Operate-Transfer Model for investment in Highway building. Under this, the asset recycling of operational national highways is done. First bundle of above model attracted investment of 1.5 billion, which was 1.5 times of NHAI estimate. Shri Gadkari expected that second bundle will have even higher response.


    TOT will give assured returns to investors without risks associated with traditional highway building projects.State Bank of India, has given loan of 3.6 billion dollars to NHAI.


    Road construction which was at pace of 2 kms.per day when NDA government took charge has reached 28 kms. per day today and government has target of taking it to 45 kms. per day in future, Shri Gadkari said.


    Vehicle manufacturing and port sector are seeing good growth and it will see higher growth further, Minister said. However the road operator needs to be aware about road maintenance and safety. With 5 lakh accidents and 1.5 accidental deaths the road safety is a big concern for India. Government will provide all support to private players for dealing with centre and state governments, Shri Gadkari said.
