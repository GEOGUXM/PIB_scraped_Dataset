    Union Minister of State for Water Resources, Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal, expressed confidence that the Inter-State River Water Disputes (Amendment) Bill, would be passed in the budget session of the Parliament from March 5. Addressing a press conference here today, after the Regional Conference of Southern States on Water Resources, he said that every time a water dispute arises between two states, a tribunal is set up to resolve it. States which do not agree with the tribunalâ€™s verdict again approach the judiciary for settlement of these issues, spending a lot of time and money. A single tribunal to resolve water disputes would be more effective in addressing this problem, he said.


    He further said that all existing tribunals would be dissolved and the water disputes pending adjudication before such existing tribunals will be transferred to this newly formed tribunal.


    Shri Meghwal said that a basin wise approach would be followed in future for addressing river water disputes. He said that the Centre has decided to hold region wise meetings to resolve water issues, and the move was welcomed by all states.


    Shri T.Harish Rao, Minister for Irrigation Government of Telangana, Shri M.Krishna Rao, Pondicherry,Shri Mathew, Minister, Kerala, Shri S.M.Husain CWC, Chairman were also present.
