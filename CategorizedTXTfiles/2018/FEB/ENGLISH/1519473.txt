    The increase in Cease Fire Violation in J&K has been precipitated by the nefarious designs of Pakistan in perpetrating violence and creating instability in the region. These nefarious designs of the enemy are being defeated through proactive and determined actions by the Army both along the LC and hinterland. Regular review of security situation is carried out and necessary changes in our strategy is made continuously to defeat the nexus.


    Appropriate retaliation to these ceasefire violations has been carried out wherever necessary. During ceasefire violations, the inhabitants of border villages which are vulnerable to shelling / firing are shifted to safer locations to prevent any loss of life. All arrangements are made for free boarding, lodging, medicare, water, electricity, food, sanitation and transport to safer places in such cases. The defences along the border are adequately fortified to withstand fire. Continuous improvements, including the usage of modern technology, in the defences are made to make them more robust and resilient.
