    The Information Technology (IT) Roadmap of Defence is in sync with contemporary technologies being used by advanced nations and aligned to the Digital India roadmap. Continuous steps are being taken by the Defence Services to remain updated on Information Technology and incorporate the latest technology in the ongoing projects. The Defence Services have promulgated ICT Roadmap incorporating 21 Information Technology projects during the period 2016-2020 in October 2016. The Roadmap includes ongoing and future tri-services ICT projects leading to effective use of ICT in areas such as Network Centric Operations, Information Security, Planning, Stores Management, General Administration and Hospital Management. Out of 21 projects envisaged to be completed by 2020, four have already been completed. As part of the roadmap, the Defence Communication Network (DCN) has been operationalized in July 2016. Further, under Network for Spectrum project, optical fiber is being laid to provide a dedicated backbone communication and IT network connecting stations of Army, Navy and Air Force.


    Bi-annual meetings of the Defence Information Technology Consultative Committee (DITCC) are held under the Chairmanship of RakshaRajyaMantri with the objective of monitoring the progress of IT implementation and e-governance in the three Services and Inter-Services organisations in a coordinated manner and resolving inter-organization issues that may arise during implementation. Regular interactions are also carried out with academia and industry to obtain contemporary solutions.
