The index for ‘Manufacture of Wood and of Products of Wood and Cork ‘ group rose by 0.4 percent to 130.8 (provisional) from 130.3 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of wooden block-compressed or not (7%), lamination wooden sheets/veneer sheets and wood cutting, processed/sized (2% each). However, the price of wooden box/crate and timber/wooden plank, sawn/resawn (2% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Paper and Paper Products’ group rose by 2.5 percent to 121.4 (provisional) from 118.4 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of corrugated sheet box (13%), tissue paper (11%), paper carton/box (3%), laminated paper and base paper (2% each) and hard board, map litho paper, pulp board, kraft paper and card board (1% each). However, the price of paper bag including craft paper bag (10%), corrugated paper board (4%) and newsprint (1%) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Pharmaceuticals, Medicinal Chemical and Botanical Products’ group declined by 1.1 percent to 121.7 (provisional) from 123.1 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of anti-malarial drugs (9%), anti allergic drugs (5%), antibiotics & preparations thereof (4%), vials/ampoule, glass, empty or filled (3%), ayurvedic medicaments (2%) and api & formulations of vitamins (1%). However, the price of anti cancer drugs (4%), antidiabetic drug excluding insulin (i.e. tolbutam) (3%), simvastatin (2%) and antioxidants, antipyretic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory formulations and antiseptics and disinfectants (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of other Non-Metallic Mineral Products’ group rose by 2.2 percent to 114.0 (provisional) from 111.6 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of graphite rod (44%), porcelain sanitary ware (5%), marble slab, asbestos corrugated sheet and fibre glass incl. sheet (2% each) and cement superfine, granite, railway sleeper, clinker, ordinary portland cement and lime & calcium carbonate (1% each). However, the price of cement blocks (concrete) (6%), ordinary sheet glass (3%), ceramic tiles (vitrified tiles) (2%) and non ceramic tiles, poles & posts of concrete, stone, chip and plain bricks (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Electrical Equipment’ group rose by 0.1 percent to 110.1 (provisional) from 110.0 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of jelly filled cables (9%), solenoid valve (8%), pvc insulated cable, rotor/magneto rotor assembly, AC motor, aluminium/alloy conductor and fan (2% each) and meter panel, copper wire, flourescent tube, electric & other meters, generators & alternators, incandescent lamps, electric accumulators and batteries (1% each). However, the price of rubber insulated cables (7%), light fitting accessories (5%), insulator (2%) and ACSR conductors, electric welding machine, insulating & flexible wire, electric switch gear control/starter, electric wires & cables and aluminium wire (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Machinery and Equipment’ group declined by 1.0 percent to 108.1 (provisional) from 109.2 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of agricultural tractors (13%), conveyors-non-roller type and pressure vessel & tank for fermentation & other food processing (6% each), separator (5%) and machinery used in the milling industry, chillers, gasket kit, hydraulic equipment, furnaces & ovens, excavator and sugar machinery (1% each). However, the price of cranes (13%), road roller (3%), open end spinning machinery, agriculture implements, pneumatic tools, pump sets without motor and pharmaceutical machinery (2% each) and precision machinery equipment/form tools, motor starter, rice mill machinery, roller & ball bearings, manufacture of bearings, gears, gearing & driving elements, air filters, mixing machine, printing machinery and mining, quarrying & metallurgical machinery/parts (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Furniture’ group rose by 0.5 percent to 120.7 (provisional) from 120.1 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of wooden furniture (3%), plastic fixtures (2%) and iron/steel furniture and steel shutter gate (1% each). However, the price of foam and rubber mattress (5%) declined.
