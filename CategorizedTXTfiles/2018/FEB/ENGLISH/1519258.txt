    Government is aware that India has a rich culinary heritage. Most of our traditional food has evolved over centuries. Indian cuisine encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines native to India. Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic group and occupations, these cuisines vary significantly from each other and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables and fruits. Almost all states have their unique recipes.


    Traditional foods are often based on a holistic approach to nutrition, as required by local people. Such food is prepared with locally available ingredients and found to have its own therapeutic and nutritional benefits.


    Government has undertaken following steps to promote Indian food culture:


    · To promote local and regional food, government has created guidelines for organising safe & hygienic food festivals.


    · Guidelines for declaration of clean street food hub have been framed including on upgrading of infrastructure of existing food streets of the country to popularise and promote local and regional cuisines.


    · Launch of book focusing on regional cuisine of India.


    This information was given by Minister of State (IC) for Culture and Minister of State for Environment, Forest & Climate Change Dr. Mahesh Sharma in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
