      Policy towards surrendered insurgents
      Posted On: 07 FEB 2018 4:46PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government of India has been implementing a Scheme for Surrender-cum-Rehabilitation of Militants in the North-East. The objective of the Scheme is to wean away the misguided youth who have strayed into the fold of militancy and bring them to the mainstream. Surrenderees are paid monthly stipend not exceeding Rs. 3,500/- p.m., for a period not more than 36 months and an immediate grant of Rs. 1.5 lakh is kept in a bank in the name of each surrenderee as fixed deposit for a period of 3 years. They are also given incentive for surrendered arms/weapons.


    In 2012, a special scheme for Government of Manipur was formulated to encourage militants to surrender and join mainstream. The scheme was effective from 01.12.2012 for 3 years and lapsed on 30.11.2015. The special features of this scheme were :-


    i. An immediate grant of Rs.2.50 lakh to be kept in a bank in the name of surrenderee as fixed deposit for a period of three years.


    ii. Monthly stipend of Rs.4000/- p.m. for a maximum period of 36 months.


    The Surrender Scheme has been modified to be more effective and will be effective from 1 st April, 2018. According to the revised scheme, the surrenderees will be paid monthly stipend not exceeding Rs. 6,000/- p.m., for a period of 36 months and an immediate grant of Rs. 4 lakhs will be kept in a bank, in the name of each surrenderee as fixed deposit for a period of 3 years. Incentive for surrendered weapons has also been revised.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
