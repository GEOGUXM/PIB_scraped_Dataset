    Centre has requested State Governments of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to take all measures for mitigation of air pollution in adjoining cities such as Ghaziabad, NOIDA, Faridabad and Gurugram in a campaign mode, so that a visible improvement in air quality can be brought about in Delhi and adjoining areas.


    The State Governments and other agencies have been directed to focus on large polluting activities, take adequate on-the-spot response in cases of vehicular pollution and traffic congestion, ensure strict implementation of ban on garbage burning and impose penalty on violators, management of fly ash, inspect brick-kilns to check if norms are being followed and encourage plantation of saplings in open areas. Emphasis has also been laid upon creating mass awareness on air pollution. “Delhi is an air-shed and actions within Delhi impact pollution outside the capital, as well as action in adjoining cities such as Gurugram, Ghaziabad, NOIDA, Faridabad impact air quality in Delhi”, Shri C.K. Mishra, Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change pointed out. He emphasized that actions being taken up in Delhi may be taken up in these cities too. He has requested deployment of teams comprising State Government officials and regulatory bodies for effective implementation of steps identified under the Clean Air Campaign.


    The Centre has also directed DMRC, NHAI, PWD, CREDAI and NBCC to enforce strict dust mitigation measures as required under the recently notified dust standards. It is pertinent to mention that since the launch of Campaign, significant improvement in air quality has been noticed vis-a-vis business as usual scenario and with respect to last year on same dates.
