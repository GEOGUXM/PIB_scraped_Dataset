    In order to promote trade in stock exchanges located in International Financial Services Centre (IFSC), the Union Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Shri Arun Jaitley proposed to provide two more concessions for IFSC. Presenting the General Budget 2018-19 in Parliament here today, Shri Jaitley proposed to exempt transfer of derivatives and certain securities by non-residents from capital gains tax. Further, the Finance Minister added that non-corporate taxpayers operating in IFSC shall be charged Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT) at concessional rate of 9% at par with Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) applicable for corporates.
