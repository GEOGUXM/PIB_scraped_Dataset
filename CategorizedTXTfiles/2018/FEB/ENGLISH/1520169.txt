    The Government approved a new policy for allocation of future coal linkages in a transparent manner for power sector consumers. This policy is christened as ‘Scheme for Harnessing and Allocating Koyala (Coal) Transparently in India’ (SHAKTI). The policy is an important initiative in alleviating one key challenge in power sector, viz. lack of coal linkage and is expected to positively contribute in resolution of a number of stressed assets.


    The annual coal linkage with non-regulated sector, from CIL, would be around 100 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) by March, 2018, taking into account the linkages auctioned recently. Further about 75 MT of coal is projected to be sold to non-regulated sector through various e-auction schemes in the year 2017-18. Total demand from unregulated sector from Singareni Colleries Company Limited (SCCL) sources is about 1.22MT. The total indicative coal demand by the Non-Regulated Sector is likely to be around 177 MT.


    This information was given by the Minister of Railways and Coal Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
