    It has come to the notice of the Government through the complaints lodged by the consumers in the National Consumer Helpline being run by the Department of Consumer Affairs that the consumers have grievances relating to e-commerce transactions in the areas of non-delivery of product, delivery of defective products, paid amount not refunded, delivery of wrong product, etc. The complaints of the consumers are transferred through the Integrated Grievance Redress Mechanism software to the companies concerned for redressal. In cases where consumers are not satisfied with the redressal, they are advised to approach the Consumer Forum of appropriate jurisdiction for redressal of their grievances.


    The Government introduced the Consumer Protection Bill, 2018 in the Lok Sabha on 05.01.2018. The Bill provides for making of rules by the Central Government to regulate e-commerce and direct selling.


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution Shri C.R. Chaudhary today in Lok Sabha.
