      Intrusion by Chinese Army
      Posted On: 05 FEB 2018 4:39PM by PIB Delhi


    There is no commonly delineated Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the border areas between India and China, there are areas along the LAC where both sides have differing perception of LAC. Due to both sides undertaking patrolling upto their respective perception of the LAC, transgressions do occur. Government is taking measures to ensure that defence forces are in a state of readiness to meet operational and security challenges.


    Government regularly takes up such transgressions along the LAC with the Chinese side through established mechanisms including Border Personnel Meetings, Flag Meetings, meetings of Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs, as well as through diplomatic channels.


    The Government consistently maintains that peace and tranquillity in the India-China border areas is an important pre-requisite for the smooth development of bilateral relations.
