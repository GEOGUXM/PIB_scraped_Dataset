      Posted On: 06 FEB 2018 4:38PM by PIB Delhi


    All feasible stretches along International borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh have been approved for erection of barbed wire fence. In addition, a stretch of 10 km has also been approved for erection of fence on border with Myanmar.


    The area of responsibility of 382 BOPs located along Indo-Bangladesh Border and Indo-Pakistan Border have been assessed as vulnerable on the basis of incidents of crimes related to cattle smuggling, phensedyl smuggling, FICN smuggling, illegal migration and attacks on BSF personnel by miscreants.


    The Government has adopted a multi-pronged approach for security arrangements at the Indo-Pakistan Border (IPB) and Indo-Bangladesh Border (IBB). The arrangements include deployment of Border Security Force (BSF), construction of border fence, construction of border roads, installation of floodlights, construction of border out posts (BOPs), introduction of Hi-Tech surveillance equipments, providing weapons and Specialised Vehicles to Security Forces, etc.


    The total sanctioned length of fence along Indo-Bangladesh border is 3326 Km out of which 2746.44 Km has been completed and the balance ‘ongoing’ work on encumbrance free stretches of land is targeted for completion by March, 2019.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijuju in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.
