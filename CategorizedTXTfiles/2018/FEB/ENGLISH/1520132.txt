      National Nutrition Mission to improve the nutritional indicators of women and children
      Posted On: 09 FEB 2018 5:37PM by PIB Delhi


    Government is implementing several schemes and programs like Anganwadi Services, Scheme for Adolescent Girls and Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojna under the Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services Scheme as direct targeted interventions to address the problem of malnutrition in the country. All these schemes address one or other aspects related to nutrition and have the potential to improve nutritional outcomes in the country. Malnutrition is not a direct cause of death but contributes to mortality and morbidity by reducing resistance to infections. There are a number of causes of death of children such as prematurity, low birth weight, pneumonia, diarrhoeal diseases, non-communicable diseases, birth asphyxia & birth trauma, injuries, congenital anomalies, acute bacterial sepsis and severe infections, etc.


    Apart from the existing schemes aimed at reduction in the levels of malnutrition among women and child, recently, the Government has set up National Nutrition Mission (NNM) for improving the nutritional indicators of children and pregnant women and lactating mothers. The Mission aims to prevent and reduce prevalence of stunting among children (0-6 years) in the country by 6%, undernutrition (underweight) prevalence among children (0-6 years) by 6%, prevalence of anaemia among children (6-59 m) by 9%, prevalence of anaemia among women (15-49 years) by 9% and reduction in prevalence of low birth weight by 6%. The Goals set under the mission will be achieved by ensuring convergence with various programmes; incentivizing States/ UTs; IT enabled Real Time Monitoring (ICT-RTM) by using Smart Phones and Tablets; Evaluation; Community mobilisation awareness advocacy; IEC, Online Course on Nutrition for Children, Nutrition message from folk songs and songs on WASH, and strengthening human resource, etc.


    As a result of these concerted efforts of the Government, the level of malnutrition among women and children has reduced in the country as is evident from the recent report of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) â€“ 4, 2015-16, which shows reduction from the previous NFHS-3 levels.
