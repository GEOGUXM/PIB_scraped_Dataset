    Participants of the Youth Fest-2018, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (February 13, 2018).


    Speaking on the occasion, the President noted that this is the first ever National Youth Fest organised by the Indian Red Cross Society. He stated that participants of this fest are now the Ambassadors of the Indian Red Cross Society – so when they go back to their respective states and regions, they should share their experiences at the Youth Fest with friends and motivate them to join the Red Cross movement too.


    The President noted that the Youth Fest provided participants an opportunity to understand different humanitarian activities of the Red Cross. He expressed happiness that such a youth-focused initiative has been taken by the Indian Red Cross Society which is the largest statutory humanitarian organisation in India. He congratulated the Society for this initiative.


    The President said that the Indian Red Cross Society will turn 100 years ‘young’ in 2020. He was sure that it will continue to carry on with its laudable activities. These activities include providing relief in times of disasters and other emergencies, promoting accessibility to health services and to safe and healthy living, and working to reduce stigma and discrimination for better integration of disadvantaged people.
