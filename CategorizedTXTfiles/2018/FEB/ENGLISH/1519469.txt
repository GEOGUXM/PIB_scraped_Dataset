      Posted On: 07 FEB 2018 3:49PM by PIB Delhi


    Creation of the post of Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) was recommended by Group of Ministers in 2001. A decision in this regard was to be taken after consultation with political parties. Subsequently, Naresh Chandra Task Force on National Security recommended creation of the post of Permanent Chairman Chief of Staff Committee in 2012. Both the proposals are simultaneously under consideration of the Government.


    Creation of appropriate military command structures is a complex exercise involving operational, technical, logistical and financial aspects, and is reviewed from time to time. Appropriate measures are being taken from time to time to ensure inter-operability between the Services including through joint training and exercises.


    This information was given by RakshaRajyaMantriDr.SubhashBhamrein a written reply to Dr. Manoj Rajoria and ShrimatiRiti Pathakin LokSabha today.
