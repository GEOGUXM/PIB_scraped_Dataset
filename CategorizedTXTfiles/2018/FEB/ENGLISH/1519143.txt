      Posted On: 05 FEB 2018 4:32PM by PIB Delhi


      “ The National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC) is a Central Sector Scheme which was set up in the year 2015-16. The overall aim of NAFCC is to support concrete adaptation activities which mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. The activities under this scheme are implemented in a project mode. The projects related to adaptation in sectors such as agriculture, animal husbandry, water, forestry, tourism etc. are eligible for funding under NAFCC. National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) is the National Implementing Entity (NIE). The details on financial support sanctioned, period of support, implementation and executing agencies, State-wise, project-wise and year-wise since 2015-16 are enclosed as Annexure I.


      The States/UTs are required to prepare the project proposal in consultation with NIE i.e. NABARD. The project proposals are required to be approved by the State Steering Committee on Climate Change to be eligible for consideration under NAFCC. It is the discretion of the State Government to engage any organization to assist in project preparation, as per their requirement ”
