    As per RITES Report of 2014 on “Integrated National Waterways Transportation Grid”, the logistic cost of transportation by Inland Water Transport (IWT) mode is lower than rail and road as given below:

                                  
Mode              Rail  Road  IWT 
                                  
                                  
                                  
Freight (Rs/TKm)  1.36  2.50  1.06
                                  
                                  

    The significant cost saving shows that the promotion of Inland Water Transport (IWT) would have positive impact on the overall logistics cost.
