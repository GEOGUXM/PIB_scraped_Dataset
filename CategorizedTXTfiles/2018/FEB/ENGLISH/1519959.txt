    Ministry of Home Affairs has informed that a s per Section 357A of Cr.P.C., State Governments have to compensate the Victim for the crimes perpetuated against them and to notify the State Vitim Compensation Scheme (VCS). In order to align with the uniformity of compensation, Central Victim Compensation Fund (CVCF) has been formulated, and that the States VCS align the same for having uniform compensation to the victims, so that the uniformity releases are made by the States to the women victims. Under the CVCF scheme, financial assistance of Rs. 200 Crores as one time grant has been released to all the States/UTs and the States/UTs release funds to the victims.


    The Ministry is implementing Scheme for setting up One Stop Centre since 1 st April 2015 to support women affected by violence. The scheme aims to facilitate access to an integrated range of services including medical aid, police assistance, legal aid/ case management, psycho-social counselling, and temporary support services to women affected by violence. Under the scheme, it has been envisaged that One Stop Centre would be set up across the country in a phased manner. In the first phase, one Centre was sanctioned per State/UT. Further, 150 additional Centres are taken up in second phase during 2016-17. Recently, the Government of India has approved setting up 150 additional districts during the year 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20. So far, 170 One Stop Centres have become operational.
