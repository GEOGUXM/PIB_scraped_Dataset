    Indian Railways have prepared an Action Plan to electrify (commission on electric traction) 38000 Route Kilometers in five years (2017-18 to 2021-22) for 100% electrification of its Broad Gauge (BG) rail routes, as given below:-

                                                                        
Year     Route Kilometer planned for commissioning on electric traction.

    For expeditious execution of Railway Electrification projects, it is planned to adopt Engineering, Procurement & Construction (EPC) tendering system having structure of incentive and penalty.


    It is expected to achieve recurring saving of ` 13510 crore per annum at current price after switch over of all trains from diesel traction to electric traction.


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Railways Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
