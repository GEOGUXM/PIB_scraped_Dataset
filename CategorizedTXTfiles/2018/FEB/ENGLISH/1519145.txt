    “ The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change implements Pollution Abatement Schemes, which includes promotion of clean technology projects. Under the Scheme, development of technologies with an objective to promote environment friendly and energy efficiency projects that reduce emissions are undertaken. So far funding has been provided to 26 such projects which include projects related to emission reduction. Further, to combat the emission of CO 2 and vehicular pollution, Government has initiated programmes to achieve about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030 with help of transfer of technology and low cost international finance including Green Climate Fund with respect to climate change.


    The environmental standards have been laid down for 106 categories of industries under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 that are in line with the international standards, including countries like China. In case of vehicular emissions, norms have been made stringent from time to time and BS-VI norms shall come into force by 2020.


    Appropriate directions have been issued by Government to control vehicular pollution and action against visibly polluting vehicles and vehicles found plying without valid Pollution Under Control (PUC) Certificate.


    ‘Pollution Abatement Scheme’ provides for funding for innovative technologies including those relating to reduction of emission ”.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Mahesh Sharma in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
