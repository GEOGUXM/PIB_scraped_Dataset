      Posted On: 05 FEB 2018 4:30PM by PIB Delhi


    In order to create a sustainable defence Aerospace ecosystem, HAL has engaged private partners for Design & Development (D&D) of products and technologies.


    To encourage private participations, HAL has created Research & Development (R&D) corpus of 10% of its Operational Profit After Tax (PAT).


    A portal for ‘Make-in-India’ has been launched on Company’s website www.hal-india.com which gives details of various foreign Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), Systems, Spare parts, electrical, electronic items for HAL’s projects such as Advance Light Helicopter (ALH), Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), Dornier (DO 228), Hawk, Jaguar etc for indigenization by Indian private industries. Following have been hosted on HAL’s website to encourage participation of private industries:-


      * More than 300 numbers of systems and sub systems of mechanical, electrical, avionics, instrumentation for various HAL’s project such as ALH, LCA, DO 228, Hawk and Jaguar etc.

      * More than 100 Tools, Testers and Ground Equipment (TTGE) items of SU-30 MKI, which can be taken up by private companies for maintenance, repair and indigenization.
      * Details of testing facilities available at HAL for utilization by private industries.

    Some of the major design initiatives taken by HAL for the following systems with the private partners are as under:
