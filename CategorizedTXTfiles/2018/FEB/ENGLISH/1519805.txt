      Execution of Unit I and II of Kudankulam Nuclear
      Posted On: 08 FEB 2018 4:24PM by PIB Delhi


    The delays in the completion of Kudankulam Units â€“ 1&2 (2X1000 MW) were mainly due to delays in sequential receipts of equipment from Russian Federation and subsequent local protests at the site. The domino effect of the protests, demobilisation & subsequent remobilisation of resources, various litigations, complying with the directives of the Honorable Court before commissioning of the plant took time. In addition, being the first-of-a-kind reactor in India of large unit size and with many imported equipments/components, the reviews and regulatory clearances also took time.


    The KKNPP-1&2 (2X1000 MW) got delayed for the reasons as stated above. This resulted in rescheduling completion of KKNPP-1 from December 2007 to May-2013 and of KKNPP-2 from December-2008 to October 2013. Presently, both the units are in commercial operation and are operating at their rated capacity. They have cumulatively generated about 23122 Million Units of electricity as on January 29, 2018.


    This was stated by the The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in a written replies to questions by Shri Majeed Memon in the Rajya Sabha today.
