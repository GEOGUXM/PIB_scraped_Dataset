    Mizoram ’s Vanlalhriatpuiia, who has represented India in the AIBA World Women’s Youth Championship last year did not break into a sweat as she outclassed Haryana’s Mahi Raghav in the preliminary round of the 57kg class boxing competitions in the inaugural Khelo India School Games in the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium Complex here today.


    The Government Mamawii Higher Secondary School student, who got a wildcard entry to the event, lost no time in establishing her superiority over the Haryanvi rival. Having found refuge in boxing after her parents divorced and she found herself without a place to live in, the Sports Authority of India hostel in Aizawl has been her home for five years now.


    This naturally gifted pugilist, who can change her stance and befuddle her opponents, did not stretch herself since she is coming back from a left shoulder injury and is still regaining strength. She will be expected to ensure Mizoram a medal from the boxing ring.


    As many as 10 bouts did not go the distance with the referees stopping the contest, affording protection to the outclassed fighters.
