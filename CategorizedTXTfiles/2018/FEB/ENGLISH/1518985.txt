      Supply of Coal To Thermal Power Stations
      Posted On: 02 FEB 2018 6:32PM by PIB Delhi


    Coal supplies are made to the Power Plants in terms of the Fuel Supply Agreement executed between Power Gencos and coal companies. Moreover, the power plants can also take coal through Special Forward E-Auction Scheme where coal is offered exclusively for power plants in regulated sector. Actual supply of coal depends on programme submitted by the Power Plants, logistics and various other factors. Many of the power stations of the country opted to consume coal from their piled up coal stock for power generation and restricted coal supplies from the Coal Companies during major part of the last year and in the initial months of this fiscal. As a result, total stock with the power stations which was 38.87 Million Tonnes (MT) in the beginning of 2016-17 had reduced to about 27.74 MT by the end of 2016-17, while coal stock with CIL increased from 57.64 MT to 68.42 MT during the same period. The supply of coal to the Power Sector has risen to 210.3 MT in first six months of the fiscal against 195.2 MT during the corresponding period of 2016-17, thus recording a growth of 7.74% (provisional). Month-wise supply of coal to power plants by CIL is at Annexure-I and the month-wise coalsupply by SCCL to power plants is at Annexure-II.


    The total vendible coal stock of Coal India limited as on 28.01.2018 (provisionally) is 33.5 MT. The demand of coal from CIL for thermal power plants for the first six months of 2018, calculated on the basis of existing Fuel Supply Agreements, is likely to be around 278.2 MT.


    The Power Houses have the option to fulfil the gap between their requisite demand and supply by the following means:


    1. Taking coal through Special Forward e-Auction conducted by CIL throughout the year.


    2 . Building up stock during lean period by agreeing to take more coal than their Annual Contracted Quantity, subject to availability and other terms.


    3. Importing coal, by Thermal Power Plants which are designed on imported coal.


    4. Using the coal produced by captive coal blocks which have been allocated by Government of India, if available.
