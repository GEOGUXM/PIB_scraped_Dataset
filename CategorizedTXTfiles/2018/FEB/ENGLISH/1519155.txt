“ Bird migration is a seasonal activity. Generally, birds migrate from the northern hemisphere during the winter season to warmer regions of tropical/equatorial regions. India is considered as a preferred wintering destination for several species of migratory birds like Bar headed Geese, Amur Falcons, Black necked cranes, Demoiselle cranes, etc.                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
As per the ‘Asian Water bird census’ coordinated by the Wetlands International, some migratory birds in the region showed a decreasing trend during the last decade, whereas some species indicated a stable population. The decline in the number of migratory birds is attributed to various factors including wetland reclamation, pollution of wetland through domestic sewage, hunting, trapping in the migratory routes, indiscriminate use of pesticides & fertilizers, reduction of habitat, climate change, etc .
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
The important steps taken by the Government for protection of migratory birds include:
