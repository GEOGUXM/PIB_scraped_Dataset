    Excessive and regular use of aerated and energy drinks may lead to hypokalaemia, hallucinations, stroke, paralysis, diabetes, cardiovascular disease etc. Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has prescribed standards for Caffeinated beverages and Carbonated water under Food Safety and Standards (Food products Standards and Food Additives) Regulations, 2011.


    States/UTs are primarily responsible to implement and enforce Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. This Act also provides penal action for non-conforming to the Act. Also, under the National Health Mission Scheme, Nutrition Education is given to enhance awareness and provide healthy and balance food at population level. States & UTs have also been requested to withdraw foods, high in saturated fats and carbonated drinks from schools’ and colleges’ canteens.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
