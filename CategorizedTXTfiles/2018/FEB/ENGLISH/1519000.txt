      Posted On: 02 FEB 2018 7:18PM by PIB Delhi


    Indian Railways has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Department of Posts for setting up of Passenger Reservation System (PRS) counters at Post Offices. PRS counters at Post offices are opened based on technical and commercial feasibility where there are no Railway Reservation Counters in nearby areas. At present, PRS counters have been provided in about 280 post offices across the country. The State wise number of the Post Offices in which Passenger Reservation System counters are available is given below:-
