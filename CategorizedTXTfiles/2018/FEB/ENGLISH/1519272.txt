    An Expert Committee was constituted in the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment to make an in-depth study of the problems being faced by the Transgender Community and suggest suitable measures to ameliorate their conditions. The Committee submitted its report on 27 th January 2014. The Committee in its report has observed that the transgender community is a highly marginalized and vulnerable one and is seriously lagging behind on human development indices mainly in the area of education and employment.


    In order to provide for protection of rights of transgender persons and their welfare, the Ministry has introduced a Bill titled “The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016” in the Lok Sabha on 2.8.2016. The Bill provides for inclusive education for Transgender Persons without discrimination on an equal basis with others and prohibits the establishments for discrimination against them in any matter relating to employment.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Vijay Sampla in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
