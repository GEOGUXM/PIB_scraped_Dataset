      BARC technology to convert sewage into bio-fertilizer
      Posted On: 07 FEB 2018 3:49PM by PIB Delhi


    Conventionally sewage treatment plant treats the sewage and the same is dried. The technology developed by Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) subjects the dried sludge to crushing and exposure to 10 kGy radiation dose. This kills the pathogens in the sludge and makes it safer for use. In the next step, BIO-NPK (Nitrogen Phosphorus Potassium) microorganisms are sprayed on to it to make it bio- fertilizer. The use of such bio-fertilizer provides organic carbon and other nutrients to the soil. The process also helps in recycling of the waste material to useful Bio-fertilizer.


    (i) A 100 ton/day capacity facility has been constructed at Ahmedabad under


    Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation.


    (ii) The cold trials have been completed successfully.


    (iii) The facility is scheduled to be fully operational soon after radiation source


    loading.


    (iv) Another similar facility of 100 ton/day capacity will be constructed at Indore


    under MoU with BARC.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
