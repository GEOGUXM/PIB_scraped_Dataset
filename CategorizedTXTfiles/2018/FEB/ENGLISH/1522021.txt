    The entire greenfield alignment has been proposed on the western side of Srinagar City to cater to/provide connectivity to the habitation on that side. It will also provide smooth and easy traffic flow in and around Srinagar City. Vehicles carrying heavy machinery to border/strategic areas of Baramula, Uri, Kupwara, Bandipora and Gandarbal will have an easier, congestion free passage along this route. The Ring Road/ Bypass will traverse through 52 villages and 5 Districts (Phulwama, Budgaon, Baramula, Srinagar & Bandipora).


    The Ring Road/ Bypass will also lead to substantial socio-economic growth of the area
