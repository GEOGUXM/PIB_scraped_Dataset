Shri Paswan said that budget 2018-19 is targeted for empowerment of farmers, youth, women and all categories of society. The life standard of common people will definitely improve with this budget.


    Shri Paswan said that the production of food grains has reached the record level. More than 300 Million Tons of fruit and 275 Million Tons of food grains have been produced during the year 2017-18. Our government has made continuous efforts for the welfare of farmers. These efforts have been continued in this budget. The income of farmers will increase with the provisions made in this budget for providing minimum support price 1Â½ times of the cost.


    He further stated that the Government has committed for construction 51 lakh new houses, electricity connection to 4 crore poor people, construction of 2 crore toilets, free gas connection to 8 crore poor women.
