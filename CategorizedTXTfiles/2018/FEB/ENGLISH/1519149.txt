      Posted On: 05 FEB 2018 4:35PM by PIB Delhi


    On 28th December, 2017, an Indian Army patrol observed three civilians believed to be Chinese nationals carrying out track construction in the Shiyung La area (District: Upper Siang, Arunachal Pradesh) approximately one kilometre on the Indian side of the LAC. The three civilians returned to the Chinese side of the LAC on seeing the Indian Army patrol. As per the agreed modalities, a Flag Meeting was arranged to discuss the intrusion. The Chinese side admitted that the three civilians had crossed over the LAC and agreed to withdraw their equipment immediately.


    Government regularly takes up such matters along the LAC with the Chinese side through established mechanisms including Border Personnel Meetings, Flag Meetings, meetings of Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs, as well as through diplomatic channels.
