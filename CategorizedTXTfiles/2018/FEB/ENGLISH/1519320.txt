        Physical Progress under NRHM during last three (2014-15 to 2016-17)


        and current year 2017-18 up to Sept.)


         1. Augmentation of Human Resources


        For the last three year period from 2014-15 to 2016-17 and the current year (2017-18 up to Sept.), about 27,454 health HR on contractual basis have been added. These include 448 GDMOs, 1,141 ANMs, 9,101 Staff Nurses, 962 Specialists, 7,859 AYUSH Doctors and 12,957 Paramedics. Apart from providing support for health human resource, NRHM has also focused on multi-skilling of doctors at strategically located facilities identified by the states e.g. MBBS doctors are being trained in Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC), Life Saving Anaesthesia Skills (LSAS) and Laparoscopic Surgery. Similarly, due importance is given to capacity building of nursing staff and auxiliary workers such as ANMs. NRHM has been supporting co-location of AYUSH services in public health facilities such as Primary Health Centres (PHCs), Community Health Centres (CHCs) and District Hospitals (DHs) and also utilizing their services in RashtriyaBalSwasthyaKaryakram (RBSK) and other national programmes.

         1. ASHA

        Under the Framework for Implementation of NRHM, a female community health worker called Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) has been engaged in each village in the ratio of one ASHA per 1000 population or one ASHA per habitation in tribal areas. For the last three-year period from 2014-15 to 2016-17 and the current year (2017-18 up to Sept.), 72,806 ASHAs were selected under NHM.

         1. Infrastructure strengthening/upgradation

        NRHM seeks to strengthen public health delivery system at all levels. For the last three-year period from 2014-15 to 2016-17 and the current year (2017-18 up to Sept.), 5,217 new constructions and 8,990 renovation/up gradation projects for various health facilities were sanctioned.

         1. Mobile Medical Units

        In order to provide services at the doorsteps of population living in the most remote and hard to reach areas, States have been supported with Mobile Medical Units (MMUs). For the last three-year period from 2014-15 to 2016-17 and the current year (2017-18 up to Sept.), 268 MMUs were added and operationalized.


         1. National Ambulance Services


        At the time of launch of NRHM 2005, such ambulance networks were non-existent. As on Sept 2017, 32 States/UTs have the facility where people can Dial 108 or 102 for calling an ambulance. Dial 108 is predominantly an emergency response system, primarily designed to attend to patients of critical care, trauma and accident victims etc. Dial 102 services essentially consist of basic patient transport aimed to cater to the needs of pregnant women and children though other categories are also taking benefit and are not excluded. JSSK entitlements e.g. free transfer from home to facility, inter facility transfer in case of referral and drop back for mother and children are the key focus of 102 service. This service can be accessed through a toll free call to a Call Centre. For the last three year period from 2014-15 to 2016-17 and the current year (2017-18 up to Sept.), 4,812 Emergency Response Service vehicles and 1,127 empanelled vehicles were operational.

         1. Mainstreaming of AYUSH

        Since inception of NRHM, mainstreaming of AYUSH has been taken up by co-locating AYUSH facilities. For the last three year period from 2014-15 to 2016-17 and the current year (2017-18 up to Sept.), 1,431 PHCs and equivalent level facilities, 1361 CHCs and equivalent level facilities and 190 DHs were taken up for co-locating AYUSH facilities).


         1. 24x 7 Services and First Referral facilities


        For the last three year period from 2014-15 to 2016-17 and the current year (2017-18 up to Sept). 277 additional facilities were operationalized as First Referral Units (FRUs), 1,650 PHCs/CHCs were strengthened to provide 24X7 services and 4,670 NBCCs, 204 SNCUs and 584 NBSUs were established.


         1. Community Participation


        RogiKalyanSamiti (Patient Welfare Committee)/Hospital Management Society is a simple yet effective management structure. This committee is a registered society that acts as a group of trustees for the hospitals to manage the affairs of the hospitalTo ensure involvement of the communities in oversight of the provisioning of health care and to redress public grievances. For the last three year period from 2014-15 to 2016-17 and the current year (2017-18 up to Sept), a total of 3,140 RKS and 35,003 VHSNCs at village level were constituted.

        ‘Public Health & Hospitals’ being a State subject, the primary responsibility to roll out Universal Health coverage is that of respective State/ UT governments . Universal Health coverage is a key goal of the National Health Policy, 2017. The provision of comprehensive Primary Healthcare is an integral and pivotal part of Universal Healthcare. Selected sub-centres are being upgraded to Health and Wellness centres across the country. In the Budget 2018-19, an additional Rs.1,200crore have been allocated exclusively for Health and Wellness Centres.


        Under NHM all States/ UTs are already supported to provide a host of free services towards achievement of Universal Health Coverage including for maternal health, child health, adolescent health, family planning, universal immunisationprogramme, and for major diseases such as Tuberculosis, HIV/ AIDS, vector borne diseases such as Malaria, Dengue and Kala Azar, Leprosy etc. Other major initiatives for which States are being supported include JananiShishuSurakshaKaryakram (JSSK), RashtriyaBalSwasthyaKaryakram (RBSK), RashtriyaKishorSwasthyaKaryakram (RKSK), implementation of NHM Free Drugs and Free Diagnostics Service Initiatives, PM National Dialysis Programme and implementation of National Quality Assurance Framework.
