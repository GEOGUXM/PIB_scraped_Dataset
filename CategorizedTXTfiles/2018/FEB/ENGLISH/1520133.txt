    i Under the Anganwadi Services of the Umbrella ICDS Scheme, Supplementary Nutrition, now a legal entitlement under the National Food Security Act, is provided to children in the age group of 6-36 months in the form of Take Home Ration in order to bridge the gap between the Recommended Dietary Allowances and the Average Dietary Intake. F ocus is also given on counselling women on infant and young child feeding practices.


    ii National Guidelines on Infant and Young Child Feeding, 2006, have been issued, through which optimal Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices for children below 2 years are emphasised.


    iii Infant Milk Substitutes Feeding Bottles, and Infant Foods (Regulation of Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 1993, as amended 2003, has been enacted in the country to protect, promote and support breastfeeding and ensure proper use of infant foods.


    iv The Mothersâ€™ Absolute Affection (MAA) programme launched by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare also aims to promote and strengthen breastfeeding through health system strengthening.


    The existing system of delivery of supplementary nutrition, i.e., Take Home Ration, Morning Snacks and Hot Cooked Meals to the respective beneficiaries at the AWCs through the AWWs is continuing.
