Presently, women are recruited in Indian Army in the Military Nursing Service and as Officers through Short Service Commission (SSC) on all India merit basis in specific branches like Army Service Corps, Army Ordinance Corps, Army Education Corps, Judge Advocate General, Signals, Intelligence and Electrical and Mechanical Engineering branches.


    Government has taken a number of measures to encourage both men and women from all parts of the country including Maharashtra to join the defence forces, viz. (i) sustained image projection; (ii) publicity campaign to create awareness among the youth on the advantages of taking up a challenging and satisfying career; (iii) participation in career fairs and exhibitions; (iv) motivational lectures in schools and colleges etc.
