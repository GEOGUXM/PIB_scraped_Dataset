      Opening of Online Customer Survey by India Post
      Posted On: 20 FEB 2018 11:34AM by PIB Delhi


    Since inception in 1854, India Post has been serving its citizens by catering to their basic requirements of communications. Over the years, it has evolved by providing varied services to Indian Citizenry in terms of Mail Services (both domestic and international), Money remittances (both domestic and international), Small Savings, Philately, Securing lives, Retail Services and Bill Payments etc.


    As plethora of services are being provided by the India Post, it is imperative to know the nerve of the customer, how (s)he feels regarding the services provided, where the services need improvement and to change the customer orientation from customer satisfaction to customer delight.


    In this connection, an Online Customer Feedback Survey is conceived wherein a customer can give his feedback or opinion on the services rendered by India Post. This Customer Feedback Survey will be for three months from 16.02.2018 to 15.05.2018 and available to public through India Post Website ( www.indiapost.gov.in ). Any citizen of the country can give feedback on the quality of service provided by India Post. The customer can also provide his comments/suggestions, if he so desires.


    On the basis of the feedbacks received from the survey, suitable inferences will be drawn upon areas to be improved not only for a particular service but will also help in identifying the lagging post office.
