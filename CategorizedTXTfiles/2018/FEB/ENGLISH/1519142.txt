    Details of New Achievements / Initiatives of the Government during the last three years in the Defence Sector are as below:-


      * Reform Measures : Based on the recommendations of the Shekatkar Committee, the Government has decided to restructure posts of different corps of Army. This will free up approximately 57,000 positions of Officers/JCO’s/OR’s and civilians which will be redeployed to improve the “teeth to tail” ratio of the Indian Army in future. Further, seven Military Farms have been closed and the cattle of these Farms have been transferred to other Military Farms. Closure of six more Military Farms is in progress.

      * Decentralisation in decision making : To empower the Armed Forces as also to reduce the time taken in decision making, a number of powers exercised hitherto by the Ministry of Defence have been delegated to the Armed Forces. These include powers relating to procurement of critical Ammunition/Spares; post-contract management of capital acquisition contracts as well as revenue expenditure; full powers in respect of revenue and capital account with respect to perimeter security etc.
