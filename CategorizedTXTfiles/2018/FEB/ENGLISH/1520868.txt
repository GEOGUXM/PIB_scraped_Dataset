    The Prime Minister, ShriNarendraModi, today attended the Ground Breaking Ceremony of Navi Mumbai International Airport. At a function in Navi Mumbai, he also dedicated the fourth container terminal at Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust.


    Addressing the gathering on the occasion, the Prime Minister noted that he had come to Maharashtra, a day before the Jayanti of the great ShivajiMaharaj.


    The Prime Minister said globalization is a reality of our times and to keep pace with globalisation, we need top quality infrastructure. He said the Sagarmala project is ushering not only development of ports but also port-led development. The Prime Minister said that the Government of India is devoting significant efforts towards the development of waterways.


    The Prime Minister said that the Navi Mumbai airport project has been pending for years. He said delayed projects cause many problems, and the PRAGATI initiative had been initiated, to give priority to completion of projects.


    He said India's aviation sector is growing tremendously, and there is a sharp increase in the number of people flying. This makes quality infrastructure in the aviation sector of prime importance, he added. The Prime Minister said that the Union Government has brought an aviation policy that is transforming the sector. He added that a strong aviation sector also gives more economic opportunities. Better connectivity leads to more tourists coming to India, he said.
