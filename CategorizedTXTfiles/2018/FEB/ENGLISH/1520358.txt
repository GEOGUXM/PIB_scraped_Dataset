      Posted On: 12 FEB 2018 6:20PM by PIB Delhi


    National Highways Auority of India (NHAI) launched a countrywide drive on 10 February, 2018, to address issues that affect highway users, such as ease of tolling, electronic tolling/FASTag lane, cleanliness at toll plazas, behavior of the toll plaza staff, deployment of marshals, cleanliness of toilets, functioning of Highway Nest (Mini), wayside amenities and availability of ambulance and cranes in case of any emergency on the highway. Chairman, NHAI Shri Deepak Kumar directed all field Highway Operation Unit officers through video conference on 09 February, 2018 to visit at least two toll plazas each across the country and check the above facilities personally to improve the users convenience. Accordingly, a massive drive was launched on more than 300 toll plazas simultaneously across the country by the Highway Operation Division on 10th Feb 2018. The Highway Operation Officers visited toll plazas and addressed issues of user convenience and took feedback from the people.


    Shri. Deepak Kumar has also said that NHAI is going to launch a ranking system of the toll plazas. Every quarter, the three best toll plazas will be identified and their names will be published on the NHAI website. He said he was confident that the competitive atmosphere created by the ranking of toll plazas will improve the amenities and overall convenience for highway users.
