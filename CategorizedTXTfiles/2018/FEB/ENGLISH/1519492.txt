      Posted On: 07 FEB 2018 4:23PM by PIB Delhi


    Suitable steps are being taken to curb Illegal mining of coal. Such steps include:


    (i) Rat holes created by illegal mining are being dozed off and filled up with stone and debris wherever possible.


    (ii) Concrete walls have been erected on the mouth of the abandoned mines to prevent access and illegal activities in these areas.


    (iii) Surprise raids/checks being conducted jointly by security personnel and law and order authorities of the concerned State Government.


    (iv) Fencing is being constructed at the various illegal mining sites along with displaying of signboards mentioning “Dangerous and Prohibited Place.”


    (v) Collection of intelligence reports about illegal coal depots and illegal movement of coal and informing district authorities of the same for taking preventive action.


    (vi) Installation of check-posts at vulnerable points to check transport documents;


    (vii) The coal companies maintain close liaison with the State authorities.


    (viii) Committee/task force has been constituted at different level (block level, sub-divisional level, district level, state level) in some subsidiaries of CIL to monitor different aspects of illegal mining.


    Similarly steps are also being taken to check incidents of Theft / pilferage of coal: –


     1. Radio-Frequency Identification Device ( RFID) based Boom Barriers and CCTV camera at weighbridges, GPRS based vehicle tracking system with geofencing, CCTV camera at strategic locations of all mines have been installed.

     2. Regular FIRs are lodged by the Colliery Management and CISF with local Thana. A close watch on the activities of criminals is being kept by CISF.
     3. Interaction and liaison with District officials at regular intervals and holding meeting with DC & other District Administrative Officials.
     4. Challans for coal transportation by trucks outside the district are being issued after fixing hologram and putting signatures of authorized officials of CISF to check pilferage.
     5. Armed Guards have been deployed at Railway sidings.
     6. Escorting of coal rakes in coordination with RPF upto weighbridge, is arranged in pilferage prone areas.
     7. Surprise re-weighment of coal loaded trucks is done at weighbridges.
     8. Surprise checks / raids are conducted by flying squads of CISF/security department.
     9. Regular patrolling is conducted in and around the mine including OB dumps.
    10. Joint patrolling with local police is also being carried out in pilferage prone areas.
    11. Check posts have been established at entry / exit points where all coal laden vehicles are physically checked.
    12. Security at coal dumps has been strengthened by fencing, proper illumination and round the clock guarding.

    As per raids conducted by security personnel as well as joint raids with the law and order authorities of the concerned State Government, the quantity of coal recovered and its approximate value during the last three years and the current year are as under:
