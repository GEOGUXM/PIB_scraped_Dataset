    Attention is invited towards recent amendments made in the Screening Test Regulations, 2002 and the Eligibility Requirement for Taking Admission in an Undergraduate Medical Course in a Foreign Medical Institution Regulations, 2002 for making it mandatory for the Indian students to qualify National – Eligibility – cum – Entrance (NEET) to pursue foreign medical course.


    After making the decision public, the Ministry is in receipt of the grievances of the students requesting that the students who have already gone abroad may be exempted from the requirement of qualifying NEET. In this context, it is informed that the regulations prescribe that the Indian Citizens / Overseas Citizen of India intending to obtain primary medical qualification from any medical institution outside India, on or after May 2018, shall have to mandatorily qualify the NEET for admission to MBBS course abroad. The decision will be implemented prospectively i.e. from May–2018. Thus, students who have already taken admission under current regulations to pursue primary medical course by taking Eligibility Certificate from MCI are exempted from qualifying NEET.
