To protect the interests of consumers the Department has issued an order according to which, manufacturers/ packers/importers of pre-packaged commodities are allowed to declare the revised retail sale price (MRP), after implementation of GST by way of stamping or putting sticker or online printing, as the case may be, on the unsold stock manufactured/packed/imported, if any, in addition to the existing retail sale price (MRP), upto 31 st March, 2018. Use of un-exhausted packaging material/wrapper has also been similarly allowed upto 31 st March, 2018 after making necessary corrections.


    The said information has been disseminated to all the stakeholders and Controllers of Legal Metrology of all States/UTs for immediate action.


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution Shri C.R. Chaudhary today in Rajya Sabha.
