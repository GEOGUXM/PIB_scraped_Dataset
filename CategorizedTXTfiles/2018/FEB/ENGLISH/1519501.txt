      Status of Fencing work along Indo-Bangladesh Border
      Posted On: 07 FEB 2018 4:46PM by PIB Delhi


    Out of the 3326 km of sanctioned length of fence along Indo-Bangladesh Border, 2746.44 km has been completed. The land acquisition process on Indo-Bangladesh Border is time consuming and cumbersome due to which the progress has been slow. In addition to pending land acquisition, limited working seasons due to heavy rainfall, extended rainy season in the North-Eastern parts of the country and difficult terrain conditions have been affecting the pace of the work.


    The Government has adopted a multipronged approach for security arrangements at the borders to tackle illegal influx of immigrants including Rohingyas. The arrangements include deployment of Border Guarding Force (BGF), construction of border fence, construction of border roads, installation of floodlights, construction of Border Out Posts (BOPs), introduction of Hi-tech surveillance equipments, besides identifying vulnerable BOPs, etc.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
