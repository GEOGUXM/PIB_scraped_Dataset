    Coal India Ltd. (CIL) had requested the Government for allotment of additional coal mines so as to make its 3 subsidiaries viz. Eastern Coalfields Ltd. (ECL), Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. (BCCL) and Western Coalfields Ltd. (WCL), 100 MT plus coal producing subsidiaries as these 3 subsidiaries do not have adequate coal reserves at present.


    This information was given by the Minister of Railways and Coal Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
