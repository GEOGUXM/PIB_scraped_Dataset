    When the people decide they want to achieve something, no force can stop them. This is the power of the people. No country is made by leaders or governments. It is the strength of the people that builds a nation


    We have to build a New India, which is free from politics of caste, communalism and corruption. We want create an India where every citizen is empowered.


    The city of Surat is blessed with remarkable determination. This is a city which believes in harmony . I urge the citizens of Surat to actively take part in this year's Yoga Day in June and the 'Run for Unity' in October.


    Such marathons augur well for the health of people. I appeal to people to embrace sports. It brings good health and furthers a spirit of teamwork .


    To build a New India is our mission. It is the best tribute to the great women and men who gave their lives for India's freedom .
