    The Ministry of Corporate Affairs had notified a new e-form called Simplified Proforma for Incorporating Company Electronically (SPICe), on the occasion of 2 nd October 2016, with the objective of providing speedy incorporation in line with international best practices. The salient features of SPICe are:-

      * Standardised format of e-Memorandum of Association (eMoA) and e-Articles of Association (eAoA) as per Companies Act, 2013 as linked e-forms.
      * Provision to apply for Company Incorporation with a pre-approved Company Name.
      * Mandatory usage of Digital Signature Certificates (DSCs) by Subscribers and Witnesses (max 7+1) in SPICe eMOA and SPICe eAOA instead of ink signed signatures.
      * Standardisation and machine tracking of changes made by stakeholders to standardised eMoA and eAoA.

    Whenever any stakeholder encounters any technical issues in using SPICe, a ticket is raised by him/her for resolution of the same. These tickets are resolved by the service provider within specified timelines. Dedicated e-mail and helpline facilities have also been created for resolution of any issues faced by stakeholders.


    This was stated by Shri P.P. Chaudhary, Minister of State for Corporate Affairs in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
