    As per Indian Roads Congress (IRC) codes/guidelines, generally 60 m Right of Way (ROW) is acquired for development of National Highways (NHs). However, considering the land constrains in some of the states the Right of Way (ROW) requirements has been reduced to 45 m.


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways, Shipping and Chemical & Fertilizers Shri Mansukh L Mandaviya in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
