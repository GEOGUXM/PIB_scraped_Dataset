    The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given approval for de-notification of 03 marla of land overlapping with NHAI for setting up of bus bay near Indian Defence University Land in Gurugram, Haryana. The Cabinet also approved refund of Rs. 1,82,719 by Government of Haryana towards de-notification of 03 marla of land to Ministry of Defence, which was paid to Government of Haryana at the time of acquisition in 2011.


    Background:


    Indian Defence University is being setup at Binola and Bilaspur, in district Gurugram, Haryana. The University will be located approximately 11 Kms from HQ National Security Guard, on Delhi - Jaipur highway towards Jaipur.


    The University will develop and propogate higher education in national security studies, defence management and defence technology and promote policy oriented research on all aspects relating to national security, both internal and external. It will promote co-ordination and interaction not only with Three Armed Services but also with other agencies i.e. Para Military Forces, Intelligence Services, Diplomats, Academicians, Strategic Planners, University Students and officers from Friendly Foreign Countries.


    A total of 03 marla of land was overlapping with NHAI, with dual ownership of MoD and NHAI. In the interest of community at large, Indian Defence University proposed construction of Bus Bay along NH-8 for decongestion of heavy traffic on Delhi-Jaipur highway. 03 marla of land have been acquired by NHAI for construction of Bus Bay for passenger mobility, comfort and safety. This will significantly improve connectivity to Gurugram -Delhi. The final ridership of Indian Defence University is likely to be approx 12000-15000 including students, teaching/ non-teaching staff and their family members apart from local inhabitants.
