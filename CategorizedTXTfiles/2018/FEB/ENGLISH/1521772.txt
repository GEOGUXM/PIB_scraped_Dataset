    Minister of State (I/C) for youth affairs and Sports Col. Rajyavardhan Rathore has said that transparency in the functioning of the IOA and National Sports Federations (NSFs) is very important and his ministry will incorporate the provisions regarding how to make them transparent in the Sports Code. He was speaking at a function here today organized by the IOA to mark the unveiling of kit and attire for the Commonwealth Games (CWG) to be held in April at Gold Coast, Australia.


    He said, the biggest sponsor of Indian sports has been the government of India and his ministry will continue to do so. Col. Rathore called upon the IOA and the NSFs to try and generate revenue on their own, taking advantage of the interests shown by the corporate sector to invest in sports.


    Referring to National Sports Development Fund (NSDF), Col. Rathore said government is committed to make equal contribution to the National Sports Development Fund (NSDF). He said, “It is a federal fund. So, whenever anyone puts money into it, it gets doubled, as the government puts equal money. Not only this, the person or company that puts the money into the fund, can tell where the money can be used, geographically, which athlete, or which sport’’ He said.


    Wishing the Indian Contingent all success during the forthcoming CWG, the Sports Minister urged the athletes to win fair and be good ambassadors for the country. He said, “We do not want to win at any cost. We need to show self-discipline, be it players, managers, everyone. We will win fairly’’.
