    The Infrastructural development and capacity augmentation of Major Ports is a continual process. The process inter-alia includes mechanization of the Ports by way of use of latest version of crane and other equipments/techniques for quicker turnaround of cargo. Implementation of some of the new initiatives suggested by benchmarking consultants had a positive impact in this regard. Keeping in view the recent initiatives taken like new Berthing Policy, 2016, Stevedoring Policy, Project Unnati, an exercise was taken to re-rate the capacities of Major Ports. This has resulted in the installed capacity of the Major Ports going up from 1065.83MTPA during 2016-17 to 1359MTPA.
