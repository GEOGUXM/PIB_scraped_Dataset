    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed a function organised by the Akhil Bhartiya Shivrajyabhishek Mahotsav Samiti on Shivaji Jayanti, today (February 19, 2018) in New Delhi.


    Speaking on the occasion, the President congratulated the Akhil Bhartiya Shivrajyabhishek Mahotsav Samiti for organising this function on such a big scale in Delhi. He was happy to note that ‘Shivaji Rajyabhishek Mahotsav’, organised by this Samiti every year at Raigad Fort, has become very popular. He stated that such efforts, to make citizens aware about the life and achievements of Shivaji, are commendable.


    The President said that Shivaji had worked to integrate people beyond caste and other identities. He used to appoint military and administrative officials on merit without any discrimination of caste and creed. He remains respected by people because of his good governance, generous and fair actions and for being engaged in public welfare. That is why Shivaji has a very special position in our history and folklore. The ideals of Shivaji’s social democracy are relevant even today.
