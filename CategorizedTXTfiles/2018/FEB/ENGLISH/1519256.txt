    A Parliamentary Delegation from the Republic of Chile led by Mr Fidel Espinoza, the President of the Chamber of Deputies of Chile, called on President of India, Shri Ram NathKovind, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (February 6, 2018).


    Welcoming the delegation, the President said that India and Chile are vibrant democracies. We have been having regular interactions between our parliamentarians. These have played an important role in strengthening our bilateral ties.


    The President was happy to note that Chile has signed the agreement to join the International Solar Alliance. He stated that over the past decade or so, Chile has taken the lead to push for the global sustainability agenda. Joining of the Alliance by Chile will strengthen our collective effort towards addressing climate change.


    The President said that economic ties between India and Chile are doing well but we can do much more together. We are hopeful that the Expanded India-Chile Preferential Trade Agreement will give a boost to our bilateral trade. The Indian growth story and Chilean expertise must benefit from each other. We can work together in areas such as mining, renewable energy and services. Cooperation in science and technology and space and defence sectors also hold immense potential.


    The President said that India and Chile share common views on various global issues. India appreciates Chile’s support and solidarity in the fight against terrorism. India also appreciates Chile’s support forits aspiration to be a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
