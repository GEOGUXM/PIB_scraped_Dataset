      Posted On: 02 FEB 2018 4:04PM by PIB Delhi


    Maharashtra's Neel Roy set the fastest qualifying time in the boys' 200m freestyle, also qualifying for the 50m butterfly final and looks set to feature among the medals on consecutive days of the swimming competition in the inaugural Khelo India School Games being held at the Dr. SPM Swimming Pool Complex here.


    Neel Roy, who holds the junior national record in the 200m individual medley, won 100m butterfly silver on the opening day of the competition. He was nearly nine seconds ahead of the next qualifier and Maharashtra teammate Vedant Bapna, who is braving a back problem.


    Madhya Pradesh's Advait Page, the National record holder in the boys' 400m individual medley, set the fastest qualifying time in his pet event and will look to close out with another strong finish in the evening session.


    Karnataka’s National record holder Saloni Dalal, who won gold on the opening day, will be searching for another medal after qualifying for the final in the Women’s 100m breaststroke, but her nearest rival Aaliyah Singh would look to put up a strong fight for the gold medal.


    The girls' 200m freestyle saw Khushi Dinesh from Karnataka lead the heat against Delhi’s Aastha Choudhury to set up a final clash.
