    In the first phase of redevelopment for 23 stations, bids only for Jammu Tawi and Kozhikode Railway Stations have been received and are under evaluation. The other stations did not receive any bid.


    A dedicated organization viz. Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Ltd. (IRSDC) was set up in the year 2012 for the purpose of station redevelopment on Indian Railways. Six stations viz., AnandVihar, Bijwasan, Chandigarh, Habibganj (Bhopal), Shivaji Nagar (Pune) and Gandhinagar have been entrusted to Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Ltd. (IRSDC) for redevelopment.


    An MOU has been signed by Ministry of Railways with Ministry of Urban Development for integrated planning for station redevelopment projects in cities identified as SMART cities in association with Smart City authorities. Ten (10) stations i.e; Tirupati, Delhi Sarai Rohilla, Nellore, Madgaon, Lucknow, Gomtinagar, Kota, Thane New, Ernakulam Jn. and Puducherry have been taken up for redevelopment under this scheme, jointly by Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) & National Building Construction Company (NBCC).


    Rail Land Development Authority has been entrusted to redevelop Safdarjung Station in New Delhi along with IRCON.
