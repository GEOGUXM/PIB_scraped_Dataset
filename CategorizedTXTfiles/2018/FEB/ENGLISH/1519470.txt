    These ten Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) are being built based on indigenous technology and supply of equipment and services by Indian industry.


    The total capacity to be added by these ten reactors would be 7000 MW. This capacity is expected to be progressively added by the year 2031. For timely implementation of these projects, the Government has initiated several measures including expediting pre-project activities, obtaining statutory clearances, procurement of long manufacturing cycle equipment, human resource planning etc .


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
