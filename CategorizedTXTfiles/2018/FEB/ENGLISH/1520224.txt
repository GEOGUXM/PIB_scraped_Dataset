        During the melodious evening the band related closely to the audience, incorporating varied choices like fanfare, overture, fusion, xylophonic, pop, swing and patriotic music, while maintaining a high standard of professionalism. The highlight of the evening was the signature performance by the young drummers of the Navy who presented their skills to everyone's delight. The Naval Drummers had also received a resounding applause during the recently conducted Beating Retreat ceremony at Vijay Chowk on 29 Jan 18. The band performed admirably under the baton of Commander VC D'Cruz, Director of Music, who is an alumnus of Pilar Music School, Goa and Trinity College of Music, London.
