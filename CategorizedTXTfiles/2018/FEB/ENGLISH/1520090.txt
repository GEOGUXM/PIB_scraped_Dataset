    The system is under implementation. All India Security Helpline 182 has been made functional through 70 Divisional Security Control Rooms (DSCR) of Railway Protection Force (RPF) of respective Zonal Railways. RPF personnel manning the Security Helpline attend calls and particulars obtained from the passenger are swiftly forwarded to concerned RPF /Government Railway Police (GRP) for rendering necessary security related assistance to passengers. Security helpline 182 is planned to be upgraded by making it automated.


    Regarding medical facilities, first aid boxes containing essential drugs and dressing materials are provided with the gurads of all passenger carrying trains. In addition, augmented first aid boxes with wide range of medicines, disposable medical material, etc. have been provided with the Train Superintendents/ Guards of Rajdhani/ Shatabdi Express trains and some nominated trains. Front line staffs deployed on trains are also trained in rendering first aid. The Station Masters of all stations have details of doctors, clinics & hospitals, both Government and Private, in the vicinity of the station, so that their services could also be availed in emergencies. Ambulance services of both Railway hospitals and State Government are utilized as and when required.


    Security has been identified as one of the priority areas by railways for strengthening and upgradation. 394 railway stations have so far been provided with close circuit television (CCTV) cameras for round the clock surveillance at these stations. All out efforts are being made in coordination with GRPs of respective States to strengthen security over Railways.
