      Posted On: 09 FEB 2018 6:54PM by PIB Delhi


    CIL has rationalized its pricing structure in order to linearize the prices of coal vis-a-vis grades of coal. Out of 17 grades of non-coking coal, CIL has decreased the prices of 7 grades, price of 1 grade remained unchanged and moderately increased the prices of 9 grades. The consecutive pricing exercises of May, 2016 and January, 2018 was aimed at rationalizing the price structure, for narrowing down the price difference of unit heat value of higher and lower grades of coal and bringing linearity. Prices of Non Coking Coal were rationalized with effect from 09.01.2018.


    As a result of the above exercise, the projected annual incremental revenue was estimated at Rs. 6421 Crores, assuming dispatch of B.E. production (2017-18) of 561.32 Million Tonne of Non-Coking Coal. For the remaining part of the year the incremental revenue was estimated at Rs. 1956 Crores assuming that 33% of the B.E production is achieved as per production target for the remaining part of the fiscal year.


    This information was given by the Minister of Railways and Coal Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
