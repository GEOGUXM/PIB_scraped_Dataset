    ‘Clean My Coach’ scheme, for any cleaning requirement in the coach, passenger can send a message through mobile (SMS) on a specified mobile number. Alternatively, passenger can also use an android app or webpage for logging the request.


    ‘Clean My Coach’ service is now being upgraded to ‘Coach Mitra’ facility which is a single window interface to register coach related requirements of passengers such as cleaning, disinfection, linen, train lighting, air conditioning and watering of coaches. ‘Coach Mitra’ facility has been introduced in about 800 pairs of trains.


    More than 71,000 service requests were received from April, 2017 to December, 2017. Nearly 90 % of those service requests were attended.


    Posters / Stickers are displayed inside the coach near main gate / doorway to make the passengers aware about the facility.


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Railways Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
