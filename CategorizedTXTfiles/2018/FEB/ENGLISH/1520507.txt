    “A synergy has been established between the four Ministries and Departments related to science and technology”, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan has said. Inaugurating a day-long workshop on technological innovations for air pollution mitigation in Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change here today, the Minister said that to tackle the issue of pollution, it is necessary to identify and pinpoint the causes of pollution and pose the problems before the scientists. Dr. Harsh Vardhan expressed confidence that science has the solution for every challenge that we face today.


    Echoing similar sentiments, Secretary, MoEF&CC, Shri C.K Mishra said that the government, industry, civil society and other representatives must sit together and chalk out a programme that can aid mitigation of pollution. Shri Mishra added that the solutions being applied must be tested and whether we are moving in the right direction. “We must create a system to reach out to people seamlessly, put in place a framework for implementation and zero in on appropriate technology, out of the basket of technologies available”, Shri Mishra emphasized.


    Addressing the gathering, Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences, Dr. Rajeevan pointed out that air pollution is caused by both – human activities, as well as due to factors related to weather and climate. He added that any solution to pollution is possibly only through a collective effort by all the concerned organizations. “Public should be involved as much as possible”, Dr. Rajeevan said.


    The workshop focused on air pollution mitigation in the ambient air and also mitigation of air pollution from pollution sources. Technological innovations for developing low cost sensors and other devices for measuring pollution were also discussed.


    Start-ups and private sector industries involved in making these innovative products also participated in a large number. It is expected that the deliberations of the workshop will help in identification of technological solutions for air pollution mitigation. Leading researchers from IITs, NEERI, Delhi University and other academic institutions also participated in the deliberations at the workshop today.
