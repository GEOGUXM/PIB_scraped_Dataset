    On 1st February 2018, the Indian Coast Guard celebrated it’s 41st anniversary of dedicated and distinguished service to the Nation. This day is an opportune moment to reaffirm their resolute commitment and selfless service for safeguarding maritime interests of our Nation.


    The Indian Coast Guard over these forty one years has matured into a lean, professional and energetic force standing tall as the fourth largest Coast Guard of the world persistent in its commitment to serve the nation and its countrymen. The Organisation has always been a sentinel of selfless service and security at sea and is recognized by the nation and the international maritime fraternity.


    The spate of achievements during the preceding year underlines their commitment, mission readiness and prowess. Rescue of stranded fishermen in the aftermath of cyclone “Ockhi”, the landmark drug apprehension of MV Henry resulting in the largest haul of approx 1500 Kg of heroin worth Rs. 3500 crore bear testimony to the synergised efforts and successful conduct of operations. Recently, the jointly coordinated Fire Fighting Operation on oil tanker MT Genessa averted a major threat to marine eco system in the Gulf of Kutch.


    A traditional reception ceremony held on the Coast Guard Day at Gandhinagar was graced by Hon’ble Governor of Gujarat Shri OP Kohli, who cut the raising day cake with Inspector General Rakesh Pal TM, Commander Coast Guard Region (North West). During the reception, dignitaries from Central Govt, State Govt and other agencies were also present.
