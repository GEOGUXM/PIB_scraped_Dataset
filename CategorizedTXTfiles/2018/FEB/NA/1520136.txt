      Following is the Opening Statement of Minister of Youth Affairs & Sports Col. Rajyavardhan Rathore at his media interaction here today:


      The government commitment towards sports and youth can be seen in increasing budgetary allocations to the ministry since the Modi government came to power.


      National Program for Development of Sports, in the form of revamped Khelo India scheme, has received a massive boost in allocation. From rupees 158 crore in 2016-17, the allocation for the program stands at rupees 575 crore for FY 18-19. Other than the 12 verticals of Khelo India, it is our vision to develop sports in Jammu and Kashmir, for which a separate allocation of 50 crore rupees has been made. Khelo India will see a massive push towards development and upgradation of sports infrastructure in the country.


      · NORTH-EAST STATES:


      o For northeastern states, budget increased from 104 crores in 2012-13 and 109 crores in 2013-14 to 148 crores in 2017-18 and 173 crore rupees in 2018-19. The government is committed to putting special emphasis on northeastern states. Those states have given us many sports champions we can be proud of. Moreover, one of the verticals of Khelo India aims to promote sports for peace and development, especially in regions ravaged by militancy. The budget is reflective of this fact.


      o National Sports University in Manipur has started offering courses. A bill granting statutory status to the same has been introduced in the Parliament


      · EMPHASIS ON INFRASTRUCTURE:


      o Infrastructure development is one of the prime verticals of Khelo India.

      o An amount of Rs 50 crore (at an approximate cost of Rs 25 crore per University, which may go upto Rs.50 crores per University depending on actual requirement) will be earmarked for supporting hubs of sporting excellence.


      o A total of up to 4 such centers are proposed to be set up per year with supplementary support from the UGC. These centers will cater to both University athletes as well as National level athletes.


      · LONG TERM ATHLETE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM


      o Out of the talented players identified at various levels through different avenues, 1000 top athletes will be identified every year and provided annual financial assistance, at the rate of Rs 5.00 lakh per annum, for a period of 8 years under a Long Term Athlete Development Programme.

      · DEVELOPMENT OF COACHING


      o The Budget Estimate /Revised Estimate for 2017-18 has been enhanced from Rs. 10 crores to Rs. 30 crores in BE 2018-19. This is an increase of 200% . We believe that a holistic system for producing world-class coaches is the need of the hour for Indian sports.


      o Along with sports infrastructure, development of soft skills is a major focus area of Khelo India. One of the verticals that aim to achieve this is the Community Coach model. (This is different from the coaching expenditure mentioned in the previous point)


      o A cascading model of Community Coach Development will be adopted for development of community coaches across the country. Under this, 2000 accredited PETs will act as master trainees and impart training to community coaches and teams.

      · TOP SCHEME


      o Under this scheme, 220 athletes have been declared eligible for ‘Out of Pocket Allowance’ from September 2017. This allowance, at rupees 50,000 per month per athlete, will be for miscellaneous pocket expenditure of those athletes.


      o This assistance is IN ADDITION TO the amount sanctioned for the training and competition exposure of those athletes under TOP scheme.


      o NSDF has released a total amount of Rs 4.62 crore till date on account of ‘Out of Pocket Allowance’ to 206 athletes. The payment is held up in the case of 14 athletes due to non-availability of Aadhar/NADA clearance etc.


      · GRIEVANCE REDRESSAL:


      o SAI centers across the country are involved in training young sporting talent. We are working on a grievance redressal and complaints system whereby any trainee can call up a number, and register any complaint they may have against the center in question (e.g. oily food, poor equipment etc.). Trainees know best the day-to-day management of such facilities, and this feedback system is important to us.
