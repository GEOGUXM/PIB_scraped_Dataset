    It has come to the notice of the Union Ministryof Petroleum & Natural Gas through the advertisement of the Government of Karnataka in Times of India (Bengaluru Edition) wherein it has been published that Mukhya Mantri Anila Bhagya Yojane (MMABY) is being implemented in the State of Karnataka in collaboration with Govt. of India. The State Government of Karnataka has earlier approached the Ministry for approval of MMABY. This Ministry had advised State Government to implement MMABY as a complementary Scheme of PMUY and has advised the State Government to follow the procedure of implementing the Scheme through OMCs only, being done in case of States Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Assam, Punjab and Haryana.


    Union Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas through number of communications from time to time has requested the State Government to implement the Scheme through OMCs only. Instead of following the same, the Govt. of Karnataka is unilaterally going ahead with implementation of MMABY directly through distributors’ network without involving OMCs. This system may lead to large scale chaos and implementation issues in the field.


    The State Government while announcing the current implementation Modalities of MMABY has gone back on the earlier agreed commitment in the joint meeting of Union Minister of PNG and Minister of Food & Civil Supplies, Govt. of Karnataka. Therefore, it is clarified that current format of MMABY not being in line with established procedure and hence is not having concurrence of Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.
