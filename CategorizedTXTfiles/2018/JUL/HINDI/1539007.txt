      Posted On: 18 JUL 2018 4:49PM by PIB Delhi


    Shram Suvidha Portal, launched by the Government on 16.10.2014, caters to four major Organisations under the Ministry of Labour & Employment, namely Office of Chief Labour Commissioner (Central), Directorate General of Mines Safety, Employees’ Provident Fund Organization and Employees’ State Insurance Corporation. The main features of the Portal are as follow:-

      * Allotment of Unique Identity i.e. Labour Identification Number (LIN) for effective, efficient and real-time governance in Labour Administration
      * To bring transparency and accountability in enforcement of labour laws through Online Inspection System and Filing of Online Inspection Report
      * Common Online Registration and Filing of Self-Certified and Simplified Single Online Annual Return for multiple labour laws to ease the complexity of compliance
      * Unified ECR under EPFO/ESIC to encourage compliance by reducing transaction costs and promoting ease of business.

    With these initiatives, the procedures have been simplified; returns and registration forms have been unified to provide an ease of doing business environment through Shram Suvidha Portal. Further, the portal provides a platform for sharing of information among the labour enforcement agencies. In this way, the Portal has not reduced but eased the compliance burden on establishments by simplifying the way of doing business and also facilitated effective enforcement of labour laws enhancing wage, job and social security for workers.


    This information was given by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Union Minister of State (I/C) for Labour and Employment in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
