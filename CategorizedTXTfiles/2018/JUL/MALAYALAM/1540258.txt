    Scientifically isolated microbes which are capable of eliminating wastes in fish farming ponds are available for sale at the KVK sales counter located at the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI). The microbes were isolated and produced by the Centre for Aquatic Animal Health of the Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT).


    These microbes help degrade fish excreta and feed remaining which promotes algae growth in fish ponds, said Dr Shinoj Subramannian, Head of Ernakulam Krishi Vigyan Kendra of CMFRI. “The microbes prevent fish mortality due to water contamination caused by accumulation of ammonia and hydrogen sulphide from the wastes. It will be very much useful to keep water quality in ideal condition by removing the wastes from water”, he said.


    “The availability of these microbes will be of greater help to those who do high density fish farming in tanks and artificial ponds in homesteads since the process of water filtration is not always practical for them. A 100 ml bottle of microbes will be quite enough for using in a 30-cent fish pond for a period of one month”, he added.


    The price of one bottle is Rs 150. The microbes are available for sale from 9.30 am to 4.30 pm in all the working days at the KVK sales counter located in the CMFRI campus. Fish growth enhancers are also available at the sales counter.
