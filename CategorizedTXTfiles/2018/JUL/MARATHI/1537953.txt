    Background Note on Cruise Tourism


    Development of cruise tourism in India is identified as a thrust area by the Government of India. A task force has accordingly been constituted under the headship of Secretary (Shipping) and Secretary (Tourism). World-renowned consultants M/s. Bermelo & Ajamil and Ernst and Young were appointed to prepare a roadmap / action plan for development of cruise tourism in India. As per the report of the consultants, there is tremendous growth potential in this sector. As against 2 lakh cruise passengers presently visiting India, 4 million passengers are expected to be visiting in coming 25 years. Almost 80% of this, i.e 3.2 million are expected to take cruises from Mumbai Port and 70% of the projected passengers are likely to be Indian citizens.


    Many measures have hence been taken to improve the infrastructure, processes, ease of doing business and reduction in tariff. This has resulted in increase in arrivals of cruise ships to India by 24% and of cruise passengers by 52%. An International Cruise ship was home-ported in Mumbai Port in year 2016-‘17 with 7 voyages from Mumbai Port. This year the home-porting ship is expected to do 9 voyages in the coming cruise season 2017-18.


    In order to meet the increasing expectations in this sector, following measures have been taken by stakeholders:


      * The Standard Operating Procedures have been finalized by port authorities, customs, Immigration, Security, CISF, state government, ship agents, tour operators, etc. to make cruise experience better. With clarity in rules and uniformity in procedures, cruise ships and passengers are assured of proper services.


      * To enable foreign cruise ships to operate domestic cruises, Indian government has relaxed the cabotage restrictions for 10 years.


      * Mumbai Port which is going to be hub for more cruises is developing a new Cruise Terminal of about 40,000 sq.m, with all passenger amenities including retail, hotel, separate departure/arrival in place of present terminal which is only about 3,000 sq. m.


      * To make competitive and reasonable tariff, all ports will have a uniform tariff comparable to the European Ports, which will give much relief against the current tariff.


      * Similarly, e-visa and e-Landing Cards have been introduced to provide quick and faster clearance from the ports.


      * Customs processes have been greatly simplified and there is hardly any Custom interface with passengers.


      * Security as per ISPS processes have been introduced and passenger clearance takes place very quickly. Further, ease of doing business is facilitated by RFID and Access Control system i.e. more technology is utilized for security purposes, reducing the manual processes that sometimes irritate the passengers.


      * Consistent efforts are being made to attain the projected expectations in this direction.
