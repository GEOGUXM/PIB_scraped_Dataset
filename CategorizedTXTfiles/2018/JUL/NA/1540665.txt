    Union Minister of State for Road, Transpoart and Highways, Chemical and Fertilizers Shri Mansukhbhai Mandaviya has instructed NHAI to expeditiously finalise the improvement proposal of Gadu junction on NH-8E. After meeting public representatives at Gadu Junction, the Minister instructed for undertaking the improvement work without affecting the livelihood of people due to relocation of their establishments near the junction. He was apprised that based on public demand and likelihood of 4-laning work to start soon, the deferment proposal of Gadu Underpass has already submitted.


    The Minister inspected the National Highway network of Saurashtra Region from Rajkot to Junagadh, Gadu, Chorvad, Somnath, Sutrapada, Kodinar and Una on NH-8E. He was accompanied by Junagadh MP Shri Rajeshbhai Chudasama, former Gujarat Minister Shri Jasabhai Barad and Ex-MLA Shri Govindbhai Parmar. He instructed all concessionaires to expedite works on costal highway between Bhavangar to Dwarka as most of the issues have already been sorted out.


    Shri Mandaviya later reviewed the flood damages due to recent heavy rains on National Highways, State Highways and other roads in the Saurashtra region. He was informed that water overtopping has taken place at some places due to low formation level of the existing road. However, with the increased formation level of new roads and adequate number of crossed drainage structures, the possibility of flooding/water overtopping is minimized.
