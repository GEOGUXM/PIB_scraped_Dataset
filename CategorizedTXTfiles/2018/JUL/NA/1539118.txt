    IAF Mountaineering Expedition to Mt Kun (7077 m) was launched on 24 Jun 2018. A total of 17 Air-Warriors had participated in this expedition. After the training at high altitude, the expedition was flagged off on 27 Jun 2018 at Pahalgam by Director, Dte of Adventure.


    IAF has been at the forefront to promote women Air-Warriors. The team containing four women Air-Warriors out of a total of 17, was successfully led by Squadron Leader Lalita Mishra, who was also a part of IAF 2011 women expedition to Mt Everest. Eight Air-Warriors successfully reached the summit on 15 Jul 18. Among the summiteers are Squadron Leader Atul Shoeran, Flight Lieutenant Ashak, Sergeant Ravinder, Sergeant M Bhist, Sergeant S Jakhar, Corporal RS Chandel, Corporal JA Wani and NC (E) Gulsad Ali.


    This is a notable achievement for Directorate at Adventure since mountaineering expedition to Mt Kun had to be called off last year (Aug 2017) due to weather and snow conditions. IAF Air-Warriors lived up to the challenges and shown true grit, team spirit and perseverance to achieve their aim.
