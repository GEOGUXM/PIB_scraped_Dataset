At Drass, they will participate in the Vijay Diwas celebrations to commemorate India’s Victory in the Kargil war and pay homage to the 527 brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives during this operation. The riders on their 200cc TVS Apache RTR bikes have already covered approximately 2500 km and will now commence the most treacherous phase of their ride while they pass through Manali, Sarchu, Leh and Drass. They will face the most challenging terrain and weather and both man and machine will be put to the ultimate test of endurance during this phase.
