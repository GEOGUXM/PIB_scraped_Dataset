      Posted On: 30 JUL 2018 5:53PM by PIB Hyderabad


    Post Office Passport Seva Kendra (POPSK), Warangal will become fully functional from 1 st August, 2018, on par with other Passport Seva Kendras (PSKs) in the State. Till date POPSK, Warangal was running in Camp Mode. Testing of Passport Seva Project (PSP) Online Mode at POPSK, Warangal was successfully completed last week, substantially reducing the processing time. In the earlier Camp Mode operations, the applicants had to wait for 7-10 days before their files could be fully processed. In the PSP online mode, the processing of all applications submitted at POPSK, Warangal will be completed on the same day itself.


    With this successful shift, POPSK, Warangal becomes the 1 st POPSK in the State of Telangana to commence full-fledged operations. In the coming months, the operations at the other 6 POPSKs in Telangana will also be shifted to PSP online mode.


    Passport applicants are requested to note the change and make best use of the facilities.
