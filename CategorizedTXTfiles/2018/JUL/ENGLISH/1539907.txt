    There is no action plan to impose ban on drinking and smoking in the country. However, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has informed that Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003 (COTPA, 2003), prohibits smoking in public places; sale of tobacco products to and by persons below the age of 18 years; and in an area within a radius of one hundred yards of any educational institution.


    Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death globally. More than 80% of all NCD related deaths in India are attributed to four major diseases â€“ cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes and tobacco consumption is the largest preventable risk factor for these NCDs.


    As per Report on Tobacco Control in India, 2004, nearly 8-9 lakh deaths per year are attributable to tobacco use.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Vijay Sampla in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
