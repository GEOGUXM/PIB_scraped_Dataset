    No incident of leakage or discharge of radioactivity through unauthorized route or beyond the limits specified by Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) from any Nuclear Power Plants(NPPs) in the last three years has been reported.


    There is a concrete and comprehensive policy for disposal of nuclear waste in the country. Radioactive waste disposal policy bears emphasis on waste volume minimization, recycle and reuse and is at par with international practices. As a waste management philosophy, no waste is released/disposed to the environment unless the same is cleared, exempted or excluded from regulations. Disposal system is designed on multi-barrier principle for ensuring effective containment of radioactivity


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
