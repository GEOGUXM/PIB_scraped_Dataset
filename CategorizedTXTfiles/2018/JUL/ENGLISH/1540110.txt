    CCTV cameras are proposed to be installed progressively at all stations except halt stations and passenger carrying coaches except General Coaches subject to availability of funds.


    Railways, through the Railway Protection Force (RPF), are supplementing efforts of GRPs of respective States to strengthen security across Indian Railways. Measures initiated by RPF to strengthen security include escorting of 2500 trains (on an average daily), in addition to escorting of 2200 such trains by GRP, access control at important stations, operationalisation of Security Help Line number 182, surveillance through CCTV cameras provided at 436 stations, prosecution of offenders under relevant provisions of the Railways Act, 1989, security of women passengers and rescue of children, etc. Regular coordination is being maintained with the State Police/GRP authorities at all levels. In addition, State Level Security Committee for Railways (SLSCR) have been constituted for all State/Union Territories (UTs) under the Chairmanship of respective Director General of Police/ Commissioner of States/ Union Territories for regular monitoring and review of security arrangements for regular monitoring and review of security arrangements for the Railways.
