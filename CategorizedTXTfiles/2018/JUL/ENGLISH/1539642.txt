    The funds spent for cleaning of Ganga river from Financial Year 2014-15 till 30 June, 2018 is Rs. 3,867.48 crore.


    River cleaning and development is a continuous process and National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) supplements the efforts of state government in cleaning of river by providing financial assistance to the state government. NMCG has sanctioned a total of 105 projects of sewerage infrastructure in Ganga basin states at an estimated cost of Rs 17,484.97 crores for river cleaning and Ganga rejuvenation. Out of these, 26 sewerage infrastructure projects have so far been completed resulting into creation of approximately 421 Million Litres per Day (MLD) additional STP capacity through construction / rehabilitation and approximately 2050 KM new sewer lines have been laid. Rest of the projects are under different stages of execution.


    The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) carries out water quality monitoring of river Ganga from Gangotri to West Bengal. Comparison of observed water quality (2017) with bathing water quality criteria indicates that Dissolved Oxygen which is an indicator of river health has been found to be within acceptable limits of notified primary water quality criteria and satisfactory to support the ecosystem of river across all seasons and for almost entire stretch of river Ganga. Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) is found above acceptable limit in part of stretches downstream of Haridwar to Kannauj, at Kanpur, at Allahabad, at Varanasi; and some stretches in West Bengal (e.g. Bahrampore, Serampore, Palta, Dakhshineswar, Howrah, Garden Reach, Uluberia and Diamond Harbour).


    The river water quality monitoring carried out in 2017 indicates improvement in water quality trends as compared to 2016. The Dissolved Oxygen levels are improving at 33 locations and is above the quality requirements of 5 mg/l. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) levels are reducing which is an improvement, at 26 locations and coliform bacteria count is reducing which is an improvement, at 30 locations.


    Some examples of stretches showing improvements are:


     1. Ganga at Rishikesh U/S

     2. Ganga at Haridwar D/S
     3. Ganga at Allahabad D/S (Sangam),
     4. Ganga at Kanpur D/S (Jajmau Pumping Station)
     5. Ganga at Varanasi U/S (Assighat)
     6. Ganga at Buxar, Ramrekhaghat
     7. Ganga at Punpun, Patna
     8. Ganga at Diamond Harbour
     9. Ganga at Garden Reach
    10. Ganga at Baharampur
    11. Ganga at Howrah Shivpur

    This information was given by Union Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Dr. Satya Pal Singh in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
