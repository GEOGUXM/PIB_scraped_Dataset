      Posted On: 19 JUL 2018 7:04PM by PIB Delhi


    During 2016-17, ninety-nine (99) on-going Major/Medium irrigation projects (Including 26 irrigation projects of Maharashtra) under PMKSY- AIBP, having ultimate irrigation potential of 76.03 lakh ha. and estimated balance cost of Rs.77595 cr. have been prioritized in consultation with States, for completion in phases up to December, 2019 along with their Command Area Development & Water Management (CADWM) works. Funding mechanism through NABARD has been approved by the Government for both Central and State share.


    Water Resources Projects are planned, funded, executed and maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priority. In order to supplement their efforts, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes such as Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) etc. under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY).


    In respect of Gadchiroli region in Maharashtra, as informed by the Government of Maharashtra, 85% area of Gadchiroli district is under forest. The conventional water resources projects like Karwapha, Chenna, Tultuli, Darpangudra could not be taken up due to non-availability of Forest Clearance. However, lift (Upsa) irrigation is envisaged by the State Government in Gadchiroli district.


    This information was given by Union Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation & Parliamentary Affairs, Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
