      Proposal to Change Sedition Law
      Posted On: 18 JUL 2018 4:08PM by PIB Delhi


    The Ministry of Home Affairs has written to the Ministry of Law and Justice to request the Law Commission of India to study the usage of the provisions of Section 124 A (Sedition) of IPC and suggest amendments, if any. The Law Commission has undertaken the examination of Section 124 A and is considering the scope and ambit of the law on sedition, in order to ascertain under what circumstances it can legitimately be invoked. A draft report on the subject has been prepared and discussed/deliberated in the Law Commissionâ€™s meeting held on 26th June, 2018 and, as decided, the same is being reviewed. The Report is yet to be finalized by the Law Commission.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question in the Rajya Sabha today.
