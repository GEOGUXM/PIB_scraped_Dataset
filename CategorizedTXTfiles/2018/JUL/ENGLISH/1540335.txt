    Raksha Rajya Mantri (RRM) Dr. Subhash Bhamre inaugurated a two-day Air Defence India – 2018 Seminar & Exhibition, organised by Centre for Joint Warfare Studies (CENJOWS), here today. Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Bhamre said the term ‘Air Defence’ implies defence operations but it is an important operational function which helps our Strike Corps to be offensive and the Air Force to act with impunity.


    He said Air is a vital aspect of national security and is assuming increasing importance due to the emerging conventional and sub-conventional aerial threat. These threats have multiplied manifolds in the recent past and as the threat has amplified so has the Air Defence set up of the nation.


    The RRM stated that in a relative short span of 70 years since Independence, Army Air Defence has witnessed phenomenal growth in its organisational structure and changes in its equipment profile. After its bifurcation from the artillery corps in 1994, the Corps of Army Air Defence has received the importance it deserves to grow and add the much required punch, he added. Dr. Bhamre congratulated the officers, men and women of the Army Air Defence Corps on the occasion of its Silver Jubilee year and urged them all to dedicate themselves to building a robust arm of the Army.


    Amongst other senior officers, Chief of the Army Staff General Bipin Rawat and Director General Army Air Defence Lt Gen AP Singh were present at the function.
