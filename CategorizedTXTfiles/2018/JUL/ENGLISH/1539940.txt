    Measures adopted for authentication and recognition of drugs and medical treatment practices of AYUSH and outcomes & achievements thereof are as under:-

     1. Analytical techniques and equipment used for the testing of Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathy (ASU&H) drugs and medical interventions are the same as applicable in modern system of medicine. Research Councils and Pharmacopoeia Committees of AYUSH undertake the work of standardization and quality testing of drugs by adopting pharmacognostical and physico-chemical methods including macroscopic, microscopic and various instrumental techniques such as Thin Layer Chromatographic fingerprints. GCP guidelines, ICMRâ€™s ethical guidelines and WHO guidelines are followed, as and where required, for clinical validation of AYUSH interventions and evaluation of efficacy & safety of drugs. Research & Development interventions in AYUSH are by and large done on the basis of integrated protocols and methodologies involving both AYUSH and modern scientific parameters of analysis and assessment. In this direction, collaborative research activities in AYUSH are being promoted involving premier medical and scientific institutions and registration of clinical research studies for ASU&H drugs is done in Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI) maintained by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).

     1. Regulatory provisions are laid down prescribing conditions required to be fulfilled for grant of license to manufacture Ayurvedic, Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathic (ASU&H) drugs, which include compliance to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and proof of safety and effectiveness as prescribed under Drugs & Cosmetics Rules and adherence to quality standards of identity, purity and strength of drugs as prescribed in the respective pharmacopoeia. WHO-GMP and Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product (CoPP) guidelines are applicable for quality certification of ASU herbal drugs intended for export and international trade.


     1. Indian Medicine Central Council (IMCC) Act, 1970 & Homoeopathic Central Council (HCC) Act, 1973 are modeled and implemented on the lines of Indian Medical Council (IMC) Act, 1956 for the purpose of regulating the education and practice of ASU&H systems of medicine and registration of the practitioners in central or state register is mandatory for doing medical practice in these systems.
