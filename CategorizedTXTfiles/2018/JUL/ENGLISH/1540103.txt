    Safety is accorded the highest priority by Indian Railways and all possible steps are undertaken on a continual basis to prevent accidents and to enhance safety. These include timely replacement of over-aged assets, adoption of suitable technologies for upgradation and maintenance of track, rolling stock, signaling and interlocking systems, safety drives, greater emphasis on training of officials and safety inspections at regular intervals to monitor and educate staff for observance of safe practices. As a result of these efforts the number of consequential train accidents have decreased from 104 in 2016-17 to 73 in 2017-18. Year-wise details of these consequential train accidents are given below:

    Policing on Railways being a State subject, prevention of crime, registration of cases, their investigation and maintenance of law & order in Railway premises as well as on running trains is the statutory responsibility of the State Governments, which they discharge through Government Railway Police (GRP)/District Police. However, Railway Protection Force (RPF) supplements the efforts of GRP to provide better protection and security of passenger area & passengers and for matters connected therewith.


    Besides, the efforts of GRP, following steps have been taken by the Railways to prevent crime incidents and to ensure secure journey of passengers in trains:-


     1. On vulnerable and identified routes/sections, 2500 trains (on an average) are escorted by Railway Protection Force daily, in addition to 2200 trains escorted by Government Railway Police of different States daily.

     2. Surveillance is kept through CCTV cameras to ensure safety and security of passengers. At present, CCTV cameras are provided at 436 stations over Indian Railways.
     3. Security Help Line number 182 is operational over Indian Railways for round the clock security related assistance to passengers in distress. It is being upgraded.
     4. An Integrated Security System (ISS) consisting of surveillance of vulnerable stations through Close Circuit Television Camera Network, Access Control etc. has been sanctioned to improve surveillance mechanism over 202 Railway stations.
     5. Frequent announcements are made through Public Address System to educate passengers to take precautions against theft, snatching, drugging etc.
     6. Through various social media platforms viz. Twitter, Facebook etc., Railways are in regular touch with passengers including women passengers to enhance security of passengers and to address their security concern.
     7. Drives are conducted from time to time against the entry of unauthorized persons in trains and railway premises.
     8. Regular coordination is made with the State Police/GRP authorities at all levels for prevention of crime, registration of cases, their investigation and maintenance of law & order in Railway premises as well as on running trains.

    Consequential train accidents have come down from 104 in 2016-17 to 73 in 2017-18.
