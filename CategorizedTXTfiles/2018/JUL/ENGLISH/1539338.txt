    The work for 4-laning of Balachera â€“ Harangajao section of NH-54 (ext.) in Assam was awarded by National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation ( NHIDCL) on 31.10.2017 on EPC mode at a cost of Rs.519.30 Crore. The appointed date was declared on 26.12.2017. The physical progress so far is about 1%.


    Silchar to Lailapur (near Vairengte) section of NH-54 in the State of Assam is in Good Condition. No construction work between Lailapur (near Vairengte) -Sarang of NH-54 in Mizoram is taken up under the Mahasadak project.


    Jatinga to Harangajao section of NH-54 in Assam got severely affected/damaged by landslide, hill movement, slip failure & sinking. Looking into the gravity of problem, it has been decided to adopt for split 4-lane construction (2-lane on new alignment and 2-lane along existing alignment) for the affected section for which M/s RITES Ltd. has been engaged by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for preparation of Detailed Project Report. Maintenance of existing NH is going on.
