      Posted On: 30 JUL 2018 3:46PM by PIB Delhi


    Sanction has been accorded for raising a new Composite Ecological Task Force (CETF) of Territorial Army to patrol sensitive river areas for protection of bio-diversity and other tasks.


    The task of pollution abatement and Ganga rejuvenation has to be taken to a level so that it becomes a peopleâ€™s movement. The CETF is expected to be largely manned by ex-service men who would bring their spirit of dedication and expertise to the tasks related of pollution abatement on the lines of Ecological Task Force Battalions, which are already successfully functioning in different parts of the country.


    The Ministry is implementing the programme of pollution abatement and Ganga rejuvenation as per Ganga River Basin Management Plan drawn by consortium of IITs which consist of short, medium and long term activities. The decision to raise the new Battalion is not on account of any lacunae in its implementation but to provide platform to every section of people whose services can be fruitfully utilised in this onerous task and has been a Component of the Namami Gange Mission.


    The Battalion is supposed to perform its role under the guidance of authorities who have the mandate to perform a particular role and they do not have the powers to arrest those found polluting the river.


    This information was given by Union Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Dr. Satya Pal Singh in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
