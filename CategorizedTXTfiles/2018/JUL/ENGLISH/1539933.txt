    India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO) Chairman and Managing Director, L.C. Goyal, today inaugurated a newly constructed hostel block for the Andh Mahavidyalaya Blind school at Panchkuian Road in New Delhi. During the year 2015-16 ITPO under its CSR initiatives contributed Rs. 52 lakh for the construction of a hostel block consisting of ground plus one floor for the blind students at the Andh Mahavidyalaya. Speaking on the occasion L.C. Goyal said that ITPO is committed to its social responsibility for the welfare of the weaker as well as marginalized sections of society. In response to a request of Institution of Blinds he also announced that ITPO will construct one portion of the old building of the school. The hostel block and renovated toilet block have been constructed by NBCC.


    The newly constructed hostel block can accommodate around 60 blind students residing at the Institute with a separate toilet facility on each floor. Most of the Divyang students residing in the hostel belong to economically backward rural families.
