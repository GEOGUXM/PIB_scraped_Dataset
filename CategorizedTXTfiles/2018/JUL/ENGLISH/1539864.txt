    In order to ensure the quality of drugs in the country, both the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) and the state drug regulators pick up a large number of samples of drugs from all over the country and have them tested and analysed in the laboratories of the Central and State Governments. The details of the drugs that do not meet the standards are notified by the Central or State regulator concerned and action, as required under the Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940, is taken. However, consolidated data in this regard, company-wise, is not maintained centrally.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
