      Posted On: 24 JUL 2018 6:32PM by PIB Delhi


    An Indian Air Force contingent comprising of four Su-30 MKI, 01 X C-130 and 01 X C-17 aircraft, landed at Darwin Air Force Base, Australia today. This is the first time that an IAF contingent is participating in a multinational air exercise in Australia with Royal Australian Air Force. This exercise involves over 100 aircraft from around the globe and will provide a unique opportunity to the air-warriors to operate in a dynamic warlike environment.


    As a part of Commonwealth countries, India and Australia have always enjoyed amicable bilateral relations. Air Forces of both the countries have participated in the Second World War. The contribution of these nations has been well documented and acknowledged by the historians. Su-30 MKI aircraft flew across the ocean to once again demonstrate our strategic reach and professionalism. As part of military diplomacy and reassuring our neighbours of our commitment to regional peace and security, while en-route to Australia, IAF engaged with the Indonesian and Malaysian Air Forces.


    After the success of recently concluded Exercise Gaganshakti-
    2018, IAF engagement with Indonesian and Malayasian Air Forces and participation in the Exercise Pitch Black-18 in Australia, IAF will once again showcase it’s capability to be an effective net security provider in the region. Navigating across the ocean, precise air to air engagement with tanker aircraft and ability to operate over the international airspace reaffirms that the Indian Air Force would always play the cutting edge of our nation’s military capability.
