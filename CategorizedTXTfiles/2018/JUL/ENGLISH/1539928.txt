    The Financial Creditors have realized claims of approximately Rs. 47,426.75 crore in 26 cases where resolution plans are submitted under the IBC framework since its enactment.


    The Union Minister of State further stated that the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code lays down a time bound and transparent framework for resolving cases of insolvency by balancing the interests of all stakeholders and maximising the value of stressed assets, post unloading it by way of insolvency resolution or liquidation as the case may be. Apart from the direct impact in terms of time bound resolution, the IBC has also impacted the borrowing and lending culture in the country. As a result, borrowers are no more willing to over-leverage debt to unsustainable levels. Similarly, lenders have also become more careful due to strict NPA provisioning norms laid down by the Reserve Bank of India.


    This was stated by Shri P.P. Chaudhary, Union Minister of State for Corporate Affairs in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.


    The Union Minister of State also provided status of process of 12 companies identified in the first phase by RBI, which is as follows:
