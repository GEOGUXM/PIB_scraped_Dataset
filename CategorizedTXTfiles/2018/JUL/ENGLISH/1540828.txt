      Posted On: 31 JUL 2018 4:26PM by PIB Delhi


    A total of 18 cases of sedition (124A IPC) were pending for trial till 2015 and 16 cases were sent for trial during 2016. Trials were completed in 3 cases during 2016 of which 1 case resulted in conviction while 2 cases were acquitted.


    Amendment of criminal law is a continuous process and the Government is aware that it has to be in sync with social changes. On the request of the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Law & Justice requested the Law Commission of India in the year 2013 to undertake a review of the criminal justice system and give a comprehensive report in the matter so that amendments can be carried out in the IPC, CrPC and the Evidence Act. Regarding section 124A of the IPC (Sedition), MHA took up the matter on 09.05.2012 with Ministry of Law & Justice to request the Law Commission of India to study the usage of the provisions of sections 124A, hold consultations and suggest amendment, if any required to the said provision, so that the Government can take necessary steps. The report of the Law Commission is awaited.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.
