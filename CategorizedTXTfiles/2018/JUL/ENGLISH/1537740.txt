    Supplementing the Government of India’s vision for e-Governance and Digital India Programme , the Competition Commission of India (CCI) today launched an Online Guidance System for determining notifiability of merger & acquisitions (combinations) in terms of the Competition Act, 2002. The Guidance System has been named as “ Do It Yourself (DIY): A notifiability check for mergers & acquisitions under the Competition Act, 2002 ”


    The online guidance system has been launched as part of CCI’s outreach initiatives and measures to simplify compliance requirements regarding combinations. The interactive online application has been developed based on relevant provisions of the Competition Act, 2002, relevant regulations issued thereunder and exemption notifications issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. This application envisages a staged process to guide the stakeholders in determining whether a merger/acquisition is notifiable to CCI.
