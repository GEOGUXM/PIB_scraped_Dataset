    Our armed forces are represented by various units / battalions in such exercises which is decided based on the nature and requirement of specific exercise. The expenditure incurred also varies on the magnitude of our participation and assets deployed during such exercises. The joint military exercises with friendly countries results in constructive engagements in operational terms and enhances the skills of our armed forces in a number of diverse areas of war-fighting by operating with armed forces of various nations. In this process the current tactical and technological practices / techniques etc., are exchanged during such exercises.


    This is a continuous process, however, relevant steps are taken from time to time to engage friendly countries and to enhance the scope of exercises based on the principle of mutual benefit and our own strategic requirements.
