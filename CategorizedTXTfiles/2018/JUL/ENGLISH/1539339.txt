      Posted On: 19 JUL 2018 6:51PM by PIB Delhi


    Based on the traffic studies and to enable efficient freight movement from industrial centres to consumption centres as well as to the ports, new greenfield routes i.e. (i) Gurugram (Sohna)-Vadodara via Sohna-Kota-Godhra (ii) Sangaria- Sanchore-Santalpur via Bikaner (iii) Ismailabad (Pehowa)-Charkhi Dadri-Narnaul (iv) Chennai-Salem and (v) Chittoor-Thatchur corridors have been identified for connecting major industrial and manufacturing hubs.


    These green field stretches are expected to reduce the existing route by about 500 km as detailed below:
