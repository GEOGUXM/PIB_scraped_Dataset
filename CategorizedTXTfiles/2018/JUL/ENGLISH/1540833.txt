    The treatment packages and the package rates for providing Rs 5 lakh health coverage to beneficiaries under the Ayushman Bharat â€“ National Health Protection Mission (AB-NHPM), have been finalized by a Committee of Experts headed by Director General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, after extensive consultations with all the stakeholders. As such the health coverage as well as the package rates under AB-NMPM are affordable.


    In fact some private hospitals represented by Industry Bodies and Professional Association have requested to increase package rates for hospitals under Ayushman Bharat National Health Protection Mission (AB-NHPM).


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
