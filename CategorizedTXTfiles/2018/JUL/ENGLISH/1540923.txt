    The total consumption of cotton in the country during 2017-18, as estimated by Cotton Advisory Board (CAB) in its meeting held on 16.6.2018, is 315.50 lakh bales.


    The Government has been implementing Cotton Development Programme with a focus on cropping system approach under National Food Security Mission (NFSM) in major cotton growing states since 2014-15 to enhance production and productivity. Thrust has been given on transfer of technology through frontline demonstrations and training in order to extend benefits to farmers. In addition, States can support Cotton Development Programme under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna.


    Further to provide remunerative prices to cotton cultivators in the country, Government has fixed the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Cotton for 2018-19 season at Rs. 5150/- per quintal for medium staple and at Rs. 5450/- per quintal for long staple. This provides margin of 50 percent over all India paid out cost including family labour.


    As a result of various initiatives taken by the Government, India has become a major cotton producer in the world and is also a net cotton surplus country.
