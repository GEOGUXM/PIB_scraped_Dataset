    Expressing concern over “clear signs of turbulence in the present world order’, the Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu today urged the Heads of Indian Missions across the world to be agile and careful and defend the country’s interests, leveraging India’s moral and material strengths to influence the global discourse through carefully strategised diplomatic response.


    Shri Naidu addressed over 125 Indian Ambassadors and High Commissioners at his official residence for 45 minutes in the presence of the Minister of External Affairs, Smt. Sushma Swaraj, the Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri M.J. Akbar, the Foreign Secretary, Shri Vijay Gokhale and the Secretary to the Vice President, Shri I.V. Subba Rao were present on the occasion.


    The Vice President said “Despite the acknowledged need for an Integrated World Order, new ‘walls’ are being erected to the free flow of goods and services and movement of people as well. This return to protectionism has the potential to adversely impact the global effort for collective advancement. There are clear signs of turbulence in the present world order. As the representatives of India in various capitals of the world, you should be alert, agile and quick in grasping the causes and consequences of such disturbances.”


    Referring to the enhanced global interest in India story further to the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s energetic efforts during the last four years to present a New India to the world, Shri Naidu urged the diplomats to convert this global enthusiasm about India into investments.


    Shri Naidu stressed the need “to weave the narrative of India by deftly drawing upon the country’s unique treasures and the timeless values as well as bring alive the excitement of the current phase of economic growth and transformative momentum in contemporary India”.


    The Vice President urged the diplomats to be proactive in shaping global position against terrorism, black money and the fugitives.


    Referring to the scope of inspired campaign against the rising India, Shri Naidu stressed the need to quickly address perceptions like ‘Women are not safe in India’.


    The Vice President observed that with the country’s core civilisational principle of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam”, the world’s largest flourishing democracy, firm commitment to negotiated resolution of disputes and the rising economic and other strengths, India has the necessary moral and material strength to influence global discourse in the interest of humanity.


    Shri Naidu urged the Heads of Missions saying “As you carefully sift the ‘negotiables’ from the ‘non-negotiables’, I would urge you to test each of your statements and stance you take in various forums from two essential standpoints. Does it advance world peace and prosperity? and Does it protect our national interests?”.


    Following is the text of Vice President’s address :

      * “External Affairs Minister ,Minister of State for External Affairs, Foreign Secretary, Secretary to the Vice President and Heads of Missions,
      * It is a pleasure for me to interact with our Heads of Missions (HOMs) today, who are assembled in Delhi for the 9th Heads of Missions Conference.
      * It is an occasion to reflect upon, discuss and fine-tune our foreign policy.
      * You all are the spokespersons, interpreters and narrators of India’s story to the world.
      * You are the architects who construct bridges of understanding, appreciation and collective advancement.
      * We are now living in a world that is more connected than ever before. We are also living in a world that is swiftly changing in many unprecedented ways.
      * The changing global geo-political and geo-economic landscape requires a new agile, carefully strategized diplomatic response.
      * Despite the acknowledged need for an Integrated World Order, new ‘walls’ are being erected to the free flow of goods and services and people as well. This return of protectionism has the potential to adversely impact the global effort for collective advancement.
      * There are clear signs of ‘turbulence’ in the present world order.
      * As the representatives of India in various capitals of the world, you should be alert, agile and quick in grasping the causes and consequences of such disturbances.

    Friends,

      * We should advocate strong action against terrorism and the wrecking of the global financial architecture from within.
      * These offenders are as big a threat as gun toting terrorists, if not more. These fugitives adopt the loot and scoot policy, leaving a trail of financial devastation behind with disastrous consequences.
      * The ease with which they find safe havens in other countries escaping the long arm of law is a serious global concern.
      * This needs to be squarely addressed by the global community.
      * It's now time for effective and united global action. Otherwise, global economy runs the risk of being derailed sooner than later.
      * The Extradition Treaties and all bilateral and multilateral agreements need to be overhauled.
      * The need of the hour is to defend and safeguard the integrated global economic order for collective good.

    Friends

      * To transform this world into the world we want, in consonance with the United Nations’ transformative, ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the world needs India.
      * The world needs India not only because we are home to nearly 1.3 billion people comprising one- sixth of humanity.
      * The world needs India because the problems and challenges facing the planet today need a humane, holistic vision.
      * The world needs India because it needs a voice that speaks of peace, non-violence and peaceful coexistence.
      * The world needs India because it needs to harness the potential of dialogue and discussion, collaboration and cooperation.
      * This vision and voice, this attitude and belief are what India has stood for over the last twenty centuries. This vision and voice of India is more relevant to the world than ever before. Our core civilizational principle of viewing the world as ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ gives us the moral strength to influence the global discourse in these times of turbulence.
      * Internalization of some of India’s universal values of peace and tolerance, inclusion and cooperation, caring and sharingcan make our planet a better place for all to live and grow.
      * I am happy to see that India has taken the lead in building sustainable development solutions.
      * International Solar Energy Alliance, launched under India's initiative at the COP 21 in Paris is one such example.
      * You must continually look for opportunities to provide similar leadership and lead the global agenda setting and implementation in as many fields as possible.
      * Friends
      * As country’s ambassadors, you tell the story of our country to foreign audiences.
      * I am sure you are able to weave the narrative by deftly drawing upon our country’s unique cultural treasures and the timeless values as well as bring alive the excitementof the current phase of economic growth and transformative momentum in contemporary India.
      * As you are aware, it has been our collective endeavour that our foreign policy formulation and implementation must be firmly tied to the domestic development agenda. India has undertaken major initiatives under the leadership of our Prime Minister, Narendrabhai Modi that focus on aspects of development such as 'Make in India', 'Skill India', 'Smart Cities' and 'Start-up India'. We have had several notable successes, though there are challenges as well.
      * I see a need for a constant dialogue between you and those who are implementing the development initiatives back home. The existing modes of this exchange of information should become a meaningful dialogue where emerging opportunities can be discussed and binding constraints identified and overcome.
      * World over, diplomacy is focusing more on its economic dimensions. India is witnessing an economic resurgence, with increase in FDIs, optimistic growth rate and an increased interest of global business community in India. With investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, health, education, science and technology, we are positioning ourselves well for achieving a higher growth rate which will help us eliminate poverty.
      * HOMs must focus on taking advantage of this momentum by capitalizing opportunities in areas of trade, services, investments and infrastructure. You must be proactive in enabling Indian industries and business to tap into world markets. You must encourage foreign investment to flow into India.
      * Indian Diaspora is a great strength of our nation. Heads of Missions must endeavour to positively build upon this strengthby engaging the Diaspora while also safe-guarding their interests and looking after their welfare. They are a huge source of strength to our country. It is our common responsibility to ensure that their efforts and goodwill is appreciated and channelized suitably.

    Friends,

      * It is important that Brand India that is projected abroad is a right mix of our cultural heritage and socio-economic resurgence.
      * I had said earlier that the world needs India. I would like to add that India also needs the world. We need to learn from and benefit from the good practices from all over the world.
      * India is strong and is gaining in strength because we are open to good ideas from all over the globe. This is what the ancient sages had also said when they said: “Aa no bhadrah kratavo yantu vishwathaha” “Let noble thoughts come to us from all over the world”. We welcome noble thoughts, thoughts that are conducive for peace, welfare and development, thoughts that reduce hatred, violence and inequality.
      * As you become consummate practitioners of the art of negotiations with other countries, and as you carefully sift the “negotiables” from the “non-negotiables”, I would urge you to test each of our statements and stance you take in various forums from two essential standpoints. “Does it advance world peace and prosperity?” and “Does it protect our national interests?”
      * During the last four years, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has significantly and remarkably raised the visibility and standing of India.
      * I am extremely happy that the dynamic External Affairs Minister, Smt. Sushma Swaraj ji and the two Ministers of State, Shri M.J. Akbarji and Shri V.K. Singh ji have set new benchmarks for all of you and have ensured an extraordinary engagement strategy by covering almost the whole world in the last four years. This unprecedented outreach, I am glad, has yielded unparalleled results.
      * I convey my best wishes to all of you for success in your assignments.

    Jai Hind!”
