      Elimination of Unmanned Level Crossings in Indian Railways
      Posted On: 18 JUL 2018 4:23PM by PIB Delhi


    The unmanned level crossings (UMLCs) on Broad Gauge (BG) are targeted for elimination by March 2020. However efforts are being made to eliminate all UMLCs on BG even earlier also. It is the endeavor of Railways to eliminate all unmanned level crossings in a phased manner by either of the following :-


      * Closure - Closing unmanned level crossings having NIL/ negligible Train Vehicle Unit (TVU).

      * Merger - Merger of unmanned level crossing gate to nearby manned/unmanned level crossing or subway/Road Under Bridge (RUB)/Road Over Bridge (ROB) by construction of diversion road.
      * Provision of Subways/RUBs.
      * Manning- Manning of unmanned level crossings which cannot be eliminated by above means.

    Four Zonal Railways i.e. Central Railway, Eastern Railway, South East Central Railway and West Central Railway have fully eliminated UMLCs on BG. Zone-wise elimination of UMLCs on BG is as follows:
