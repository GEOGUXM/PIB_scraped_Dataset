    These estimates are based on a study of Credit Suisse and have been mentioned in a booklettitled ‘Digital Payment: Trends, Issues and Opportunities’ , launched today by Mr. Ratan P. Watal, Principal Advisor, NITI Aayog and Member Secretary, EACPM, at a conference organised by FICCI and NITI Aayog.This is the 2 nd annual edition of the booklet on Digital Payments which was published in July 2017.


    The key messages of the booklet on Digital Payments are:
