    In view of improved security situation in Meghalaya and in certain areas of Arunachal Pradesh bordering Assam:


     1. disturbed area under Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, (AFSPA) for 10 km belt in Meghalaya bordering Assam, was not extended beyond 31.3.2018.


     1. areas under AFSPA in the districts of Arunachal Pradesh have been reduced from 16 police stations/police out post earlier to 8 police stations bordering the State of Assam besides continuing of AFSPA in Tirap, Changlang and Longding districts of Arunachal Pradesh.


    The decision to issue notification for declaring ‘disturbed area’ under AFSPA, is taken periodically after making an objective assessment of the ground situation in consultation with security agencies and the concerned state Governments.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
