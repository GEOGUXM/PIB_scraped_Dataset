    Following measures are being taken to check cross border infiltration.

     1. Appropriate deployment of Border Guarding Forces (BGFs).
     2. Conduct of area domination patrols by BGFs, establishment of Mobile Vehicle Check Posts, laying of nakas, conducting operations based on specific intelligence, use of Surveillance Equipment etc.
     3. Securing the border by physical barriers, reducing inter BOP distance, infrastructure development like border roads, flood lighting etc. for better mobility of BGFs resulting in increased surveillance.
     4. Introduction of Force multipliers and Hi-Tech surveillance equipment to enhance the surveillance of border.
     5. Up-gradation of intelligence (Int) network and coordination with sister agencies.
     6. Conduct of special operations along the border and in depth areas.
     7. Regular vulnerability mapping of each border;
     8. Conducting anti-tunneling exercise on regular basis in vulnerable areas on Indo-Pak Border.
     9. Deployment of Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS) to secure borders where physical fence is not feasible especially in riverine/ nullah terrain, etc.
