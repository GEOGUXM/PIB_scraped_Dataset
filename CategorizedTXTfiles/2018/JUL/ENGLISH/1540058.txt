      Assistance to states affected by NAXAL Problem
      Posted On: 25 JUL 2018 3:48PM by PIB Delhi


    Left Wing Extremism (LWE) violence has decreased substantially in the country. The reduction is due to comprehensive security and development initiatives taken by the Central and State Governments over a period of time. State wise data on LWE violence for the period 2009 to 2018 is at Annexure-II.


    The Government has a holistic approach towards combating LWE wherein it supplements the efforts of the State Governments over a wide range of measures. A National Policy and Action Plan has been put in place that envisages a multi-pronged strategy involving security related measures, developmental interventions and ensuring rights & entitlements of local communities etc. Security related measures include assistance to LWE affected States by providing CAPF Bns, helicopters, UAVs, construction of fortified police stations, funds for modernization of State Police forces, arms and equipment, training assistance, sharing of intelligence etc. On development side, apart from flagship schemes of the Central Government in infrastructure, education, health, skill development, agriculture etc, several initiatives have been taken specifically for development of LWE affected areas. These include focused schemes for development of roads, installation of mobile towers, skill development, improving network of banks and post offices, health and education facilities, particularly in the most affected districts.


    Resolute implementation of this policy by the Central and State Government has already resulted in considerable improvement of the situation and will eventually lead to complete elimination of the LWE menace form the State.
