    Due to concerted and co-ordinated efforts, the offtake / dispatch of coal of CIL has increased from 488.86 MT in 2014-15 to 580.04 MT in 2017-18. The progress of production of CIL is reviewed regularly. CIL has been directed to work out a definite action plan to ensure higher production and offtake in future. CIL has also been directed to ensure that necessary clearances for the existing coal mines are in place which will help in increasing the coal production in the short/medium term and also operationalizing the newly allocated coal mines for further increasing production in the medium term. New rail lines are being laid for smooth evacuation of increased coal production from the mines of growing coalfields of SECL, MCL and CCL.


    This information was given by the Minister of Railways, Coal, Finance & Corporate Affairs, Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
