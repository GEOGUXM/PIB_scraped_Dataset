    A population level initiative of prevention, control and screening for common Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) (diabetes, hypertension and cancer viz. oral, breast and cervical cancer) has been rolled out in 2017-18 under National Health Mission (NHM), as a part of comprehensive primary healthcare. Under the initiative, frontline health workers such as Accredited Social Health Activists and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives are leveraged to carry out screening and generate awareness about the risk factors of NCDs among the masses. This initiative will not only help in early diagnosis but will also generate awareness on risk factors of the diseases. The initiative has been rolled out in over 150 Districts across the country and as informed by the State Governments, about 72 lakh people have been screened for common NCDs under Population Level Screening.


    Government of India is also implementing National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) under the National Health Mission for awareness generation for Cancer prevention, opportunistic screening, early detection and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment. Interventions for COPD, a Chronic Respiratory disease, are included under NPCDCS.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
