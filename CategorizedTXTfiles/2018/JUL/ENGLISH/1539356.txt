    CPCB conducted joint inspection of 32 industries, along with Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), located at Muzaffarnagar in Hindon River basin (tributary of Yamuna River). The joint inspection report was submitted before the Hon’ble NGT. Hon’ble Tribunal vide its order dated 22.09.2017 imposed environmental compensation of Rs.10.0 Lakhs each to 07 Pulp & Paper industries and Rs.15.0 lakhs to a Slaughter house and Rs.5.0 lakhs to a Chemical industry.


    Under “ Pollution Inventorisation Assessment & Surveillance on river Ganga (PIAS)” project implemented by CPCB under the Namami Gange programme, regular inspection & monitoring of Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) is carried out for compliance verification of the stipulated environmental norms. Inspections are also carried out on annual basis through third party technical institutes viz. IIT’s, NIT’s & CSIR Institutes for verification of compliance. First round of inspection by technical institutions was carried out during 2017 and second round of inspection is in progress and action is taken appropriately by SPCBs on the defaulting industries.


    CPCB recently in May & June also inspected industries discharging effluent to drains leading to Yamuna river located in Yamuna basin (Sonipat and Panipat).
