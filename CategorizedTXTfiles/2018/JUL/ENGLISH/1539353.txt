    River cleaning is a continuous process and NMCG supplements the efforts of state government in cleaning of river by providing financial assistance to the state government. NMCG has sanctioned a total of 105 projects of sewerage infrastructure in Ganga basin states for river cleaning and Ganga rejuvenation. Out of above 105 sewerage projects, 25 sewerage infrastructure projects have so far been completed resulting into creation of approx 421 MLD additional STP capacity through construction/ rehabilitation and approx 2050 KM new sewer lines have been laid. Rests of the projects are under different stages of execution.


    The State Governments/Executing Agencies submit Utilization Certificates/Interim Un-Audited Financial statements which is the mechanism to ensure proper utilization of funds supplied by Central Government. Periodical reviews are held at different levels to monitor financial and physical progress.


    This information was given by Union Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation & Parliamentary Affairs, Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
