    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, inaugurated Dharohar Bhawan - the new Headquarters building of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), - at Tilak Marg in New Delhi today.


    Speaking on the occasion, he said that the Archaeological Survey of India has performed significant work over the course of the last 150 years or so.


    The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of taking pride in our history, and in our rich archaeological heritage. He said that people should take a lead in knowing about local history, and archaeology of their towns, cities and regions. He said lessons in local archaeology could form part of the school syllabus. In this context, he also mentioned the importance of well-trained local tourist guides, who are familiar with the history and heritage of their area.


    He said each archaeological discovery, painstakingly made by archaeologists over long periods of time, has its own story to tell. In this context, he recalled how he and the then French President had travelled to Chandigarh a few years ago, for a first-hand view of archaeological discoveries made by a joint Indo-French team.


    The Prime Minister said that India should showcase its great heritage with pride and confidence, to the world.


    The new Headquarters building of ASI has been equipped with state-of-the-art facilities, including energy efficient lighting and rainwater harvesting. It includes a Central Archaeological Library with a collection of about 1.5 lakh books and journals.
