      Study on Groundwater Contamination
      Posted On: 30 JUL 2018 3:36PM by PIB Delhi


    Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) regularly monitors ground water quality of shallow aquifers on a regional scale, once every year. Ground water quality data generated during various scientific studies and ground water quality monitoring indicate that the ground water in major part of the country is potable. However, some parts of various states are contaminated by Salinity, Arsenic, Fluoride, Iron, Nitrate and Heavy metals beyond the permissible limits of BIS. State-wise details are given below. The name of the districts affected with ground water contamination in Rajasthan State is given are given below.


    The possible sources of contamination of ground water are either geogenic or anthropogenic in nature. Anthropogenic contamination of ground water is due to industrial discharges, landfills, diffused sources of pollution like fertilizers and pesticides from agricultural fields etc.


    Steps taken to check the ground water pollution are â€“


      * Control of industrial pollution under the provision of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 by consent mechanism being applied by SPCBs/ PCCs.

      * A mutually agreed time targeted programme is implemented under Corporate Responsibility on Environment Protection (CREP).
      * Establishment of Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) for cluster of Small Scale Industrial units.
      * Continuous water quality monitoring systems are being established on industrial units in the country, through the directives issued by CPCB, for getting real time information on the effluent quality.

    For improving the coverage of safe drinking water to rural population, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation supplements the efforts of the states by providing them with technical and financial assistance through the centrally sponsored National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP). It is the State Governments who plan, design, approve, execute and operate & maintain the schemes for providing safe drinking water to rural population.
