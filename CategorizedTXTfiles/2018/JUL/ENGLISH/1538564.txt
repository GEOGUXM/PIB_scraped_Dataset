      The Nivati-Medha break water harbour in the Konkan region of Maharashtra is being considered under “12 Champion Sectors initiative” of the Ministry of Commerce. The was informed by Union Minister of Commerce and Industry and Civil Aviationafter a meeting with RajanTeli, former member of Maharashtra Legislative Council, from the Konkan region. The Minister informed him that a proposal has already been submitted to the Maharashtra Maritime Board in this regard.


      Suresh Prabhu directed concerned officials to expedite the construction of the breakwater harbour once the Maharashtra Maritime Board approves the proposal.


      In the absence of such a harbour the financial condition of fishermen in the area is deteriorating as they are totally dependent on the vagaries of the sea.Building of the breakwater harbour will help the fishermen to haul abetter catch even in adverse conditions and also give a boost to the tourism industry by allowing cruise ships to dock at the harbour. Other tourism activities will also get a fillip. This will raise the living standards of local people in the area noted the Minister.
