      Posted On: 19 JUL 2018 4:26PM by PIB Delhi


    The Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013 came into force w.e.f. 16.01.2014. The Government initiated the process for appointment by convening the Selection Committee meeting on 03.02.2014. The Selection Committee under section 4(1) of the Act, also constituted an eight Member Search Committee on 21.02.2014 in terms of section 4(3) of the Act. Two members of the Search Committee declined the offer of appointment. Looking into such difficulties experienced and to remove certain difficulties in the operationalisation of the Act including issues relating to appointment of Chairperson and Members of Lokpal, etc. in the absence of a Leader of Opposition recognized as such in the Lok Sabha, the Government introduced the Lokpal and Lokayuktas and other related law (Amendment) Bill, 2014 in Lok Sabha on 18.12.2014. The Bill was referred to the Department –related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice for examination and report. The said Committee has submitted its report in the Parliament on 07.12.2015. In view of the apex court’s decision in the matter of Writ Petition (C) No. 245/2014 filed by Common Cause – a registered society , wherein it was observed that the law as it stands today is an eminently workable piece of legislation, two meetings of the Selection Committee under section 4(1) of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013 were held on 1 st March, 2018 and 10 th April, 2018. Upon the recommendations of the Selection Committee, Hon’ble President has nominated Shri MukulRohatgi, former Attorney General of India as “Eminent Jurist” Member of the Selection Committee. The next meeting of the Selection Committee has been convened on 19 th July, 2018 to consider the constitution of Search Committee in terms of provisions of section 4(3) of Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013.
