      Posted On: 25 JUL 2018 4:44PM by PIB Delhi


    At present, there are nine (9) nuclear power reactors at various stages of construction. Twelve (12) more nuclear power reactors have been accorded administrative approval and financial sanction by the Government in June 2017. Currently, pre-project activities are in progress on these projects. In addition, the Government has also accorded ‘in principle’ approval of sites for setting up nuclear power reactors in future. The details are as follows:

    The names of the countries with whom negotiations have been held for the supply of fuel for the Atomic Power Plants are Russia, Kazakhstan, Canada, Uzbekistan, France and Australia.


    The reactors under construction and accorded administrative approval and financial sanction are expected to be completed progressively by 2031. In respect of reactors to be set up in future at sites accorded ‘in principle’ approval, the completion would depend on their respective start dates.
