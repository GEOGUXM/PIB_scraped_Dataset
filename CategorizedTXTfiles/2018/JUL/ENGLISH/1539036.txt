2016-17    3,53,089         5,593.90             
                                                 
                                                 
                                                 
2017-18 *  3,95,014         6,210.00             
                                                 
                                                 

    Coffee is primarily an export commodity for India. The demand and consumption in domestic market is about 25% to 30% of country’s coffee production and therefore, does not drastically impact the prices of coffee in the domestic market.


    This information was given by the Minister of State of Commerce and Industry, C. R. Chaudhary, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
