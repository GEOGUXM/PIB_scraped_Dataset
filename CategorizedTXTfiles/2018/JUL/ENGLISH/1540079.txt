    DPSUs have been instrumental in developing a robust Defence manufacturing eco-system in the country. DPSUs aim to be lead integrators, primarily through robust private partnership, while retaining its core competencies, thus ensuring availability of a vibrant defence manufacturing system in the country. To strengthen and consolidate Research and development functions, DPSUs / Ordnance factories are taking research assistance from academic institutes like IIT, NITs etc. The Government has also been encouraging all DPSUs for their meritorious performance by conferring RakshaMantri awards.


    Moreover, DPSUs and Ordnance Factories have been permitted to export up to 10% of their annual production. For items where there is a capacity constraint, in DPSUs export, they would be required to ramp up their capacity accordingly in subsequent years. The strategy provides for creation of an Export Promotion Body, engaging Indian Missions / Embassies abroad in export promotion, better use of offset policy, export of indigenously developed defence systems and streamlining of the export regulation process. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for issue of “Authorisation” for export has been simplified and put in public domain and requirement of Government signed End User Certificate (EUC) for export of parts and components and other non-sensitive military store, sub-assemblies, sub-systems has been done away with.


    Modernizing the existing Production facilities is a continuous process of DPSUs. Modernization is taken up to enhance capability and capacity. This includes up-gradation of technology through establishment of new processes, state-of-the art manufacturing and design facilities with an aim of increased productivity efficiency and improved work condition.


    DPSUs have modernized its infrastructure by increasing capital expenditure to meet the requirements of Indian Armed forces.
