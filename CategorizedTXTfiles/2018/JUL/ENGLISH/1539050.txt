ICAI's association with NBAA, Tanzania will help in indirect employment generation for Indian CAs through recognition and acceptability amongst Tanzania based employers. It is also likely to build a positive image for Indian Chartered Accountants currently working in African market and those intending to move to the African & Tanzania market.
