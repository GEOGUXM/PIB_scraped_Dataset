      Posted On: 25 JUL 2018 3:50PM by PIB Delhi


    Government of India vide a Notification S.O. 3460 (E) dated 17 th November, 2016, declared Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) as an unlawful association under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, as IRF and its members, particularly, the founder and President of the said Association, Dr. Zakir Naik, had been encouraging and aiding its followers to promote or attempt to promote feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religious communities and groups.


    A request for issuance of Red Corner Notice was sent to the INTERPOL on 19.05.2017. Clarifications sought by the INTERPOL on 10 th August, 2017 and 06 th October, 2017 were also provided. However, during 102 nd session of the INTERPOL Commission from 24-27 December, 2017, the INTERPOL opined that at that stage of the proceedings, the issuance of Red Corner Notice for Zakir Abdul Karim Naikâ€™s arrest with a view to his extradition was pre-mature, since the charge sheet has not been filed till the sending of the original request for Red Corner Notice to INTERPOL. In view of the above INTERPOL opinion, a fresh warrant was issued by the Ld. Court against Zakir Abdul Karim Naik on 24 th November, 2017 and a fresh request of Red Corner Notice was sent to the INTERPOL on 03.01.2018. No further communication has been received so far from the INTERPOL.


    The Provisional Arrest Request and Extradition request in respect of Zakir Abdul Karim Naik was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Government of Malaysia on 19 th January, 2018.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
