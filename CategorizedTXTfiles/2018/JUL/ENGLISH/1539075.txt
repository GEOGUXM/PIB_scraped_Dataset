    Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare has launched a Central Sector Scheme named “Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region” (MOVCDNER) for implementation in the States of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura during 2015-16 to 2017-18. The scheme aims at development of certified organic production in a value chain mode to link growers with consumers and to support the development of entire value chain starting from inputs, seeds, certification and creation of facilities for collection, aggregation, processing, marketing and brand building initiative. The scheme was approved with an outlay of Rs.400 crore for three years.


    The assistance is provided for cluster development, on/off farm input production, supply of seeds/planting materials, setting up of functional infrastructure, establishment of integrated processing unit, refrigerated transportation, pre-cooling/ cold stores chamber, branding, labelling and packaging, hiring of space, hand holdings, organic certification through third party, mobilization of farmers/processors etc.


    National Bamboo Mission (NBM) is focused on development of Bamboo inter alia in the North Eastern States, which has nearly 60% of the country’s Bamboo growing stock. With an outlay of Rs.1,290 crore, the NBM aims at holistic development of the Bamboo sector (including in NER) by incentivizing construction industry to give impetus to the use of Bamboo in construction. It seeks to mandate eco-friendly Government constructions through use of Bamboo and Bamboo products to give a fillip to this eco-friendly industry. The CPWD has already included Bamboo items in Delhi Schedule of Rates, 2016 and Ministry of Tourism has issued advisories to adopt ‘BIS Certified & Energy Efficient’ Bamboo Mat based products/ construction works in all the hilly areas and sloped roof.
