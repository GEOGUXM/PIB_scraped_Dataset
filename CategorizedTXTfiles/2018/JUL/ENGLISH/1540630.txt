      Posted On: 30 JUL 2018 3:41PM by PIB Delhi


    The policy on Strategic Partnerships in Defence Sector was promulgated on 31.05.2017 as Chapter-VII of Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) 2016 titled as “Revitalising Defence Industrial Ecosystem through Strategic Partnerships”. The Chapter was uploaded on Ministry of Defence website: https://www.mod.nic.in and came into effect immediately on its promulgation.


    The following 04 segments (major platforms) have been identified under Strategic Partnership (SP) Model: Fighter Aircrafts, Helicopters, Submarines and Armoured Fighting Vehicles / Main Battle Tanks. Since promulgation of the SP policy, Requests for Information (RFIs) have been issued for all four segments – Naval Utility Helicopter (NUH), Submarines, Fighter Aircraft, and Armoured Fighting Vehicles (AFV) / Main Battle Tanks (MBT). The evaluation of responses to the RFIs for NUH, Submarines and Fighter Aircraft has already been initiated. Evaluation of RFI response for AFV / MBT will be undertaken on receipt. Hence, there is no delay in operationalising the SP model.


    This information was given by Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri Manish Gupta in Rajya Sabha today.
