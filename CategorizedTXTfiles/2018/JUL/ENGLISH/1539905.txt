      No proposal of star ratings to old age homes
      Posted On: 24 JUL 2018 5:28PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government has recently revised the on-going Scheme of Integrated Programme for Older Persons (IPOP) and renamed it as “Integrated Programme for Senior Citizens (IPSrC)”, laying down standards with respect to food, medical facilities, recreation, security, clothing, rooms, bathrooms/toilets, hygiene and sanitation, and physical aids. At present, there is no proposal for rating of any Old Age Homes/Senior Citizens Care Homes on the lines of star ratings to hotel chains.


    The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 is being considered for amendments which inter-alia propose that all institutions, whether run by a Government/Non-Governmental/ Voluntary/Private Organisations or Society/ Trust and providing residential/Multi-Service Day-Care facilities for senior citizens for their care and welfare, shall be registered as a service provider and that the Central Government shall prescribe Minimum standards required for the establishment of Senior Citizens Care Homes and functioning and maintaining of Multi-Service Day Care Centres.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Vijay Sampla in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
