    The Minister of State for Home Affairs Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir said that Cyber frauds can be curtailed if the citizens are more aware and responsible while making digital transactions. He was speaking at "Cyber Safety and Digital awareness programme for senior citizens‚Äù organized by Delhi Police here today.


    Lauding the initiative of Delhi Police to organizing such awareness programme specially for the senior citizens who are the soft targets of cyber crimes, he said that Ministry of Home Affairs is planning to launch an online cyber crime portal where people can file complaint online regarding such crimes.


    He also said that every citizen should also remain vigilant and aware with police being on guard to reduce the rate of cyber crimes.
