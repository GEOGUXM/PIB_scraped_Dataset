      Posted On: 31 JUL 2018 4:30PM by PIB Delhi


    The Department of Pharmaceuticals is implementing a countrywide campaign in the name of ‘Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana’ (PMBJP) under which quality generic medicines are made available at affordable prices to all through specific outlets i.e. PMBJP Kendras. As per the guidelines of PMBJP, a PMBJP Kendra may be opened in any part of the country. As on 25.07.2018, 3879 PMBJP Kendras are functional in 34 States/Union Territories and more than 600 districts of the country which are covering both urban and rural areas in the country. The data of functional PMBJP Kendras in rural areas is not maintained. Government endeavors to cover all States, Union Territories, Districts, Tehsils, Blocks and Gram Panchayats of the country by opening more PMBJP Kendras across the country.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
