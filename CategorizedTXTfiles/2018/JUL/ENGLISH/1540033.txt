      Posted On: 25 JUL 2018 3:17PM by PIB Delhi


    In terms of instructions issued by Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT) on transfer/posting of Government employees, all Ministries/Departments of Government of India are required to have their own guidelines for transfer/posting of their employees providing for the following -


     1. minimum tenure;


     2. have a mechanism akin to Civil Services Board for recommending transfer; and


    Respective Ministries/Departments are also required to place the transfer policy in public domain.


    There is no proposal to formulate single transfer policy for the Government employees as guidelines for transfer/posting of employees depend on the specific requirement of individual Ministries/ Departments. Moreover, the State Public Services are under State List for which the State Governments are competent to make rules and policies. Accordingly, there is no proposal to constitute any commission for single transfer policy for both Central & State employees.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
