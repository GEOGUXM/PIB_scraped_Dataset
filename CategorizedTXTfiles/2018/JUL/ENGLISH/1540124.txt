     1. GST rates on fly ash and its products have been reduced to 5%.
     2. To facilitate 100% ash utilization by all coal based thermal power plants, a web portal for monitoring of fly ash generation and utilization data of Thermal Power Plants and a mobile based application titled “ASHTRACK” has been launched by the Government that will help to establish a link between fly ash users and power plants executives for obtaining fly ash for its use in various areas.
     3. A Workshop and Video Conferences to make use of the Web Page for data updation have been conducted by CEA and NTPC.
     4. Ash-park has been developed and awareness programme for utilisation of fly ash and its products have been conducted.
