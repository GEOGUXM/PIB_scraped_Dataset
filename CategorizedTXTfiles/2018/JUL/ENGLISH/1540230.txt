    The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment financed the Government of NCT Delhiâ€™s survey on mapping and estimation of street children who use drugs in Delhi. The survey was conducted by AIIMS during the year 2015 and it was estimated that 22.1 % of all street children of NCT of Delhi have used some substance excluding tobacco in the last one year. Tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and inhalants were commonly used. As per the report of the survey, the common reasons for substance initiation were peer pressure, curiosity, to experience high, to be part of the peer group, to deal with various stress and difficulty in life like anger/sadness, harsh weather, handle hunger or to forget about the family.


    The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has issued an advisory to all States and Union Territories on 11.8.2016 for taking coordinated action to address the problem of drug abuse which, inter-alia, includes prevention of substance abuse among children in the country such as:-


     1. Conducting Sensitization and Preventive education programmes in schools and colleges throughout the year.
