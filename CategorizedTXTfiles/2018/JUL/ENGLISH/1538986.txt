      Posted On: 18 JUL 2018 4:11PM by PIB Delhi


    In the event of persistent cross border firing/ceasefire violations along LoC/ IB by Pakistan, the people residing in the affected areas have to leave their homes temporarily. The affected families are shifted to safer places. They are provided all kinds of basic amenities like water, electricity, medical aid, etc. at the designated safe shelters.


    Government has sanctioned construction of 14,460 bunkers, to mitigate the hardships being faced by people living on IB/LoC, due to cross border firing. Further, ex-gratia cash relief of Rs.5 lakh is given to next of kin (NoK) in case of death or to the victim of more than 50% disability. Compensation for housing damages/losses, crop losses, livestock losses, relief for stay at relief camps and displacement etc. to those affected by cross border firings are also given as per National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) norms of assistance, fixed from time to time. Compensation of Rs.50,000/- per loss of milch animal is also given.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question in the Rajya Sabha today.
