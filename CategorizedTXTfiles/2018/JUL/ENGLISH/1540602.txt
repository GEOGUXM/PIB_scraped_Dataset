      Statement of Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh on NRC in Assam
      Posted On: 30 JUL 2018 1:12PM by PIB Delhi


    Today NRC Draft List has been published in Assam. I want to emphatically say that this is only a draft and not the Final NRC.


    Everyone will have full opportunity to file Claims / Objections as per provision in law. Only after the disposal of claims and objections, the Final NRC will be published.


    Some people are unnecessarily trying to create an atmosphere of fear. I want to assure all that there is no need for any apprehension or fear. Some misinformation is also being spread. NRC process has been done impartially. Some people may not have been able to submit necessary documents. They will get full opportunity through Claims and Objections process.


    I want to clarify that even after the Final NRC, every person will get an opportunity to approach the Foreigners Tribunal.


    This means that even those whose names do not figure in the Final NRC will get an opportunity to approach the Tribunal. There is no question of any coercive action against anyone.


    NRC process is being carried out with complete fairness and transparency. It has been monitored by the Honourable Supreme Court.
