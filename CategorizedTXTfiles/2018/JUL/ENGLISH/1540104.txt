    Western DFC passes through States of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra and Eastern DFC through States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. 98.7% of land required for both the corridors has been acquired. Overall 97.2% of total contracts have been awarded. The financial and physical progress on both corridors is 47.2% and 49.6% respectively. Both EDFC and WDFCs are targeted for commissioning in phases by year 2020.


    The project faced some difficulties usually faced in execution of any Railway project such as delay in land acquisition, resistance by Project-affected Persons (PAP) and environmental/forest clearance. These are resolved by constant interaction with and assistance from concerned agencies and the State Governments.


    This information was given by the Minister of State of Railways, Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
