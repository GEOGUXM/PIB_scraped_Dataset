    Hon’ble Prime Minister has stated that State Governments must deal sternly against anti-social elements that create violence in the name of cow protection. Even though, ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and State Governments are primarily responsible for prevention, detection, registration and investigation of crime and for prosecuting the criminals through their law enforcement agencies, Ministry of Home Affairs have issued advisories to the States and UTs, from time to time, to maintain law and order and ensure that any person who takes law into his/her own hand is punished promptly as per law, which are available on website www.mha.gov.in . Such as advisory was also issued to the States and UTs on 04.07.2018 and on 23.07.2018 wherein State Governments and UT Administrations have been advised to keep watch for early detection of such trends having potential for violence, and take all required measures to counter them effectively and to deal firmly with persons taking law into their own hands.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
