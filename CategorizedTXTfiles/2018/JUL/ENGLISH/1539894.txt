    Police and Public order are State subjects as per the Constitution. Various initiatives are taken by States to modernize their law enforcement setup from their own budgetary resources and no record of such initiatives is maintained at Central level. However, Ministry of Home Affairs is implementing Cyber Crime Prevention against Women and Children scheme during 2017-2020. This includes development of a portal for reporting complaints of online content of child sexual abuse by public for initiating action for its removal and further action as per law by law enforcement agencies of States/UTs.


    As per UNODC report titled ‘Global Study on Legal Aid’ available on website of UNODC, 48% of the member states identified the shortage of lawyers outside urban areas as the main impediment in ensuring universal access to legal aid. Training and capacity building of prosecutors and judicial officers is an ongoing activity and various national and state academies/institutes regularly organize training programmes for their skill development.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
