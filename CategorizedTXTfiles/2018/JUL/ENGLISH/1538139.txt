     1. Cities Investment To Innovate, Integrate and Sustain (CITIIS) Challenge


    When Smart Cities Mission was launched on 25 June 2015 a competitive, challenge process was used to select the 100 Smart Cities. Now, the Challenge process is being applied to project implementation, in line with the NITI Aayog guideline where under the Indo-French partnership program, at least 15 projects would be selected through an All-India Challenge. The projects would be in four sectors- Sustainable Mobility, Public Open Spaces, Urban governance & ICT and Social and Organizational Innovation in low-income settlements. The duration of the program will be three years (FY2018-19 to FY2020- 21).


    A Loan of EUR 100 million would be extended by AFD to selected CITIIS projects in the form of grant. The repayment of the principle and interest would be equally shared by the Central Government and State Government on 50:50 basis. Each awarded CITIIS project will benefit from a grant ranging from INR 20 Cr. to INR 80 Cr (max project outlay: 160 crore). The CITIIS grant is expected to cover from minimum 50% up to 80% of the project cost subject to a maximum of INR 80 Cr. and additional funding amounting to least 20% to be secured by the awarded cities through its own resources.


    In addition, EUR 6 million would be given as grant to be shared between the SPVs of the Smart Cities, State Governments and Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs for capacity building activities. The National institute of Urban Affairs would conduct the Challenge process for selection of projects under the Indo-French partnership.


    The financial support and foreign technical assistance will help Smart Cities to access World Class expertise for selected innovative projects. It also intends to improve peer learning activities & cooperation within the smart cities and enhance the knowledge both at the State and National Level.


     1. LOCAL AREA PLAN (LAP) & TOWN PLANNING SCHEME (TPS)


    The Local Area Plan (LAP) and Town Planning Scheme (TPS) has been formulated under the AMRUT to enable planning for developing infrastructure in the Brownfield areas (those parts of the city that are already developed but not able to sustain the pressure on the existing infrastructure) & the Greenfield areas (periphery of the city that is prone to haphazard growth and development), respectively. They will be implemented in 25 selected cities on pilot basis. The existing areas or Brownfield areas can be redeveloped by preparing Local Area based Plans (LAP). While at the same time, the Town Planning Schemes (TPS) can be implemented for planned urban expansion in the peripheral Greenfield areas.


    The Scheme will enable the selected cities to formulate Local Area based Plans (LAP) and Town Planning Schemes (TPS) for which 100% central assistance would be available. Based on the formulation of Local Area based Plans (LAPs) and Town Planning Schemes (TPS) by the city concerned, prioritization of urban infrastructure projects would be taken up.


    An amount of Rs. 50 crore would be provided as Central assistance @ Rs 2.00 crore per city for identified 25 cities for preparing LAP/TPS. The Central Assistance shall be released in 3 installments; 20% with submission of preliminary proposal, 40% during submission of draft plan and remaining 40% during submission of final plan.


    The exercise of preparing Local Area Plan and Town Planning Scheme is expected to be completed in a period of one year; the preliminary proposal in two months, the draft plan in 10 months. Town and Country Planning Organization (TCPO) will provide handholding support to the state nodal agency.


    Guidelines have been prepared for the operationalization of the Scheme and shall be circulated to 25 States where the cities have been identified with a request to submit the proposal for preparing LAP/TPS.


    The Scheme shall enable the cities to identify the areas for Local Area Plan and Town Planning Scheme and encourage bottom up approach to resolve the area based infrastructure problems in a short period of time.
