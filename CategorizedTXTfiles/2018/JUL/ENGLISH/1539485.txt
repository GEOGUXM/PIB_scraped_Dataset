      Posted On: 20 JUL 2018 5:35PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government has set a target of doubling of farmers’ income by the year 2022. The Government has constituted an Inter-Ministerial Committee under the Chairmanship of Chief Executive Officer, National Rainfed Area Authority, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare to examine issues relating to doubling of farmers’ income and recommend a strategy to achieve doubling of farmers’ income in real terms by the year 2022.


    At present, thirteen draft volumes of ‘Strategy for Doubling Farmers’ Income by 2022’ prepared by the Committee have been uploaded on the website of this Department (http://agricoop.nic.in/doubling-farmers) for seeking public opinion.


    Parallely, the Government is aiming to reorient agriculture sector by focusing on income centeredness. In order to realise net positive returns for the farmer, schemes as follows, are being promoted and implemented in a major way through the States/UTs viz:- Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme; Neem Coated Urea (NCU); Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY); Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY); National Agriculture Market scheme (e-NAM); Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY); National Food Security Mission (NFSM); Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH); National Mission on Oilseeds & Oilpalm (NMOOP); National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA); National Mission on Agricultural Extension & Technology (NMAET) and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY). In addition, schemes relating to tree plantation (Har Medh Par Ped), Bee Keeping, Dairy and Fisheries are also implemented. All these schemes are implemented to enhance production and productivity of agriculture and thereby enhance income of farmers.


    Minimum Support Price (MSP) is notified for both Kharif & Rabi crops based on the recommendations of the Commission on Agriculture Costs & Prices (CACP). The Commission collects & analyses data on cost of cultivation and recommends MSP.


    Giving a major boost for the farmers’ income, the Government has increased the Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) of all kharif crops for 2018-19 Season. This decision of the Government is a historic one as it redeems the promise of the pre-determined principle of fixing the MSPs at a level of at least 150 percent of the cost of production announced by the Union Budget for 2018-19.


    National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) has not conducted any survey during the last one year for collecting data of the present income of country’s farmers and animal rearers residing in various parts of the country. However, NSSO conducted a Situation Assessment Survey (SAS) of Agricultural households during its 70 th round (January 2013- December 2013) in the rural areas of the country with reference to the agricultural year July 2012- June 2013. The survey collected the details of income generated by the agricultural households during the agricultural year July 2012-June 2013 from different economic activities. Average monthly income (Rs.) per agricultural household for different States/ group of UTs during July 2012 - June 2013 as per the results of the Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Households, NSS 70th round (January 2013 – December 2013) is annexed.
