    As per estimates of National Sample Survey (2011-2012), there are about 5 crore building and other construction workers in the country.


    The building and other construction workers are registered by the States/ UTs through their State Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Board under Section 12 of the Building and Other Construction Workers’ (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996. As per the information received from States/ UTs, the approximate number of building and other construction workers registered as beneficiaries upto 31.03.2018 is 3.06 crores.


    Amendment in the provisions of the laws is a continuous process and the Govt. has recently amended the Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 1998 so as to make the process of filing of Unified Annual Return transparent and convenient. The amended Rule 242(1) reads as under:


    Every employer of a registered establishment shall file a Unified Annual Return online in Form XIV annexed to the Rationalisation of Forms and Reports under Certain Labour Laws Rules, 2017, on the Shram Suvidha Portal of the Ministry of Labour and Employment on or before the 1 st day of February following the end of the year to which it relates.


    This information was given by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Union Minister of State (I/C) for Labour and Employment in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
