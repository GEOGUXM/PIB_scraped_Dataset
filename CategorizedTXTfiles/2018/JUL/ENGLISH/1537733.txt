Redevelopment of such areas is based on certain parameters, spatial planning norms and environment related conditionalities regarding provisions and augmentation of essential infrastructure and services.


    The Central Govt. by way of modifications in the Master Plan 2021 has already permitted residential use, (Group Housing) on any existing industrial unit(s)/plots with a minimum area of 3000 sqm abutting road 24 mtr. ROW and above as a part of re-development, for optimal utilization of the land and to extend the benefit to the plot owners.
