      Special package for completion of irrigation projects to address agrarian distress in Vidarbha and Marthwada and other chronically drought prone areas of Maharashtra
      Posted On: 18 JUL 2018 4:58PM by PIB Delhi


    The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has approved Implementation of Centrally Sponsored Scheme for completion of balance works of 83 Minor Irrigation projects and 8 major/medium irrigation projects of Marathwada, Vidarbha and drought prone areas of the rest of Maharashtra at an estimated cost of Rs.13651.61 Crore,over a period of 5 years (2018-19 to 2022-23). Out of this Rs.3831.41 crore would be provided by Central Government. State can avail state share for these projects through NABARD.


    Maharashtra has experienced hydrological and agricultural drought during the years 2012 to 2016. The situation has been worst in Vidarbha and Marathwada regions with unfortunate incidence of suicides by farmers. Also other Drought Prone Areas (DPA) in rest of Maharashtra have experienced distress in the recent years. Agriculture in Marathwada and Vidarbha regions is mainly rain fed. Further, ground water availability beyond rainy season in not adequate due to typical basaltic formation. Thus creation of surface water sources will help in sustainable agriculture and addressing agrarian distress in these areas.


    The details of the project are as follows:

      * Central Assistance @ 25% to 83 surface Minor Irrigation (SMI) and 8 Major/medium irrigation (MMI) projects
      * Period of Implementation : 2019-20 to 2022-23 ( 5 yrs)
      * Balance Irrigation Potential : 3.77 lakh ha.
      * Expenditure Already incurred by State :Rs. 11552.15 cr.
      * Balance Estimate Cost (as on 1/4/18) :Rs.13651.61 cr.
          + CA @ 25% :Rs.3412.90 Cr
          + Reimbursement @ 25% of expenditure during 17-18 : Rs. 418.51 cr.
      * Total C. A. : Rs. 3831.41

    Arrangement of Funds:

      * CA : Through Budget of MoWR, RD & GR
      * State Share : Budget or NABARD within their FRBM limits.

    The special package will help in creation of additional potential of 3.77 L Ha. in Marathwada, Vidarbha and drought prone areas of the rest of Maharashtra and transform the agriculture scenario of the region resulting in generation of substantially more employment opportunities through increase in cropping intensity, agro processing and other ancillary activities. It will increase yield of their crops and thereby increase the income of the farmer.


    The projects included under special package are over and above the 26 major/medium projects of Maharashtra having ultimate potential of 8.50 L Ha being funded under PMKSY-AIBP.
