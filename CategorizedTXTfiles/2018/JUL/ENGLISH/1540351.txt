    Ministry of Labour and Employment has invited representatives of all the Central Trade Unions for constructive inputs and suggestions in stakeholdersâ€™ consultation workshop on Draft Social Security Code . The Ministry has reiterated that the exercise of codification of existing 15 labour laws into a code on social security is essentially to strengthen the existing social security frame work in the country and to universalise it in a right-based manner for every worker in the country. It is based on the recommendation of 2 nd National Conference on Labour (NCL) in which, all the Social Partners were involved.


    The Government is committed towards protecting the Social Security arrangements of India being availed by the existing EPF/ESI members. On the other hand, it is proposed to extend the existing cover to more workers. There is no proposal/thinking to usurp the existing funds, belonging to existing members and the same shall be protected.


    The Ministry is committed to process of dialogue and the present consultations are a part of this very process.
