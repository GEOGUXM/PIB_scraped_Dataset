    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:

         1. Crude oil production by ONGC during June, 2018 was 1774.08 TMT which is 3.61% lower than the monthly target and 4.64% lower when compared with June,2017. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-June, 2018 was 5392.34 TMT which is 2% lower than target for the period and lower by 4.42% than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall are as under:

      * ESP problem in wells of NBP field (Rig deployment post monsoon).

      * Increasing water cut in B-173 and Neelam field & less than anticipated production from some wells of Vasai East field.
      * Sub-sea leakage of some well fluid lines of Mumbai High & Neelam Heera Asset, leading to flow restriction.
         1. Crude oil production by OIL during June, 2018 was 278.54 TMT which is 4.72% lower than monthly target and 0.08% lower when compared with June, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-June, 2018 was 837.90 TMT which is 3.70% lower than target for the period and 0.30% lower than production during the corresponding period of last year. Major reason for lower production is less than planned contribution from work over wells and drilling wells.

         1. Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during June, 2018 was 831.77 TMT which is 1.65% lower than the monthly target and 1.72% lower than June, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-June, 2018 was 2577.01 TMT which is 0.46 % higher than target for the period and 1.38% higher than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall were natural decline in Ravva & Panna-Mukta field and restricted polymer injection due to drilling activities in Mangala.


    2. Natural Gas


    Natural gas production during June, 2018 was 2677.91 MMSCM which is 8.59% lower than the target for the month and 2.82% lower when compared with June, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production during April-June, 2018 was 8068.91 MMSCM which is 6.98% lower than target for the period but 0.14% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II . Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of June, 2018 and cumulatively for the period April-June, 2018 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-June, 2018 was 669.35 MMSCM which is 14.74% lower than the cumulative target and 7.49% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. The reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

      * Operational loss due to flow line repair etc.
      * Environmental issues.

         1. Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during June, 2018 was 504.78 MMSCM which is 7.58% lower than the monthly target and 7.16% lower when compared with June, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-June, 2018 was 1493.28 MMSCM which is 8.28% lower than the cumulative target and 6.99% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * KG-DWN-98/3 (RIL): Closure of 2 wells in D1D3 and 1 well in MA field. Well B6 ceased to flow on 30.04.2018.

      * Raniganj East (Essar): Few wells closed for planned maintenance and refrac jobs. Major customer 'Matix' under operational shutdown.
      * Sohagpur West (RIL): Underperformance of CBM wells.

     1. Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)


    Refinery production during June, 2018 was 21865.02 TMT which is 1.29% higher than the target for the month and 9.06% higher when compared with June, 2017. Cumulative production during April-June, 2018 was 63958.95 TMT which is 0.30% higher than the target for the period and 5.02% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III .

    Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production


         1. CPSE Refineries’ production during June, 2018 was 12697.66 TMT which is 0.10% lower than the target for the month and 5.16% higher when compared with June, 2017. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-June, 2018 was 37125.58 TMT which is 0.65% higher than the target for the period and 4.01% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:

      * IOCL, Guwahati: Throughput is higher due to deferment of M&I shutdown of CDU/DCU/HDT.
      * IOCL, Barauni: Throughput is lower due to Naphtha Containment.
      * IOCL, Gujarat: Throughput lower due to low North Gujarat Crude receipt and Gas oil Ullage creation for DHDS revamp shutdown in Jul’18.
      * IOCL, Paradip: Throughput is marginally lower than plan due to PCK (pipeline compatible kerosene) run in DHDT.
      * BPCL, Kochi: Throughput is lower due to shutdown during this month.
      * HPCL, Mumbai: Throughput is lower due to unplanned slowdown of primary units.
      * CPCL, Manali: Throughput is lower than target due to sulphur containment problem.

    3.2 Production in JV refineries during June, 2018 was 1650.99 TMT which is 11.18% higher than the target for the month and 181.30% higher when compared with June, 2017. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-June, 2018 was 4843.07 TMT which is 10.25% higher than the target for the period and 86.64% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year . The major reason for high variation in production was major turnaround in HMEL refinery undertaken during April - June, 2017.


    3.3 Production in private refineries during June, 2018 was 7516.37 TMT which is higher by 1.69% than the target for the month and 1.75% higher when compared with June, 2017. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-June, 2018 was 21990.03 TMT which is 2.22% lower than the target for the period and lower by 2.75% compared to production during corresponding period of last year.


    3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of June, 2018 and cumulatively for the period April-June, 2018 vis-à-vis April-June, 2017 are given at Annexures - IV and V respectively.
