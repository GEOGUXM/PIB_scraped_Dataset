      Posted On: 24 JUL 2018 5:17PM by PIB Delhi


    At present, there are no plans to set up Cyber Warrior Police Force. The Government is working on setting up of Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C). The main objective of the I4C scheme is to set up a national cybercrime coordination center for law enforcement agencies of States/UTs as an effective apparatus to handle issues related to cybercrime in the country.


    Adequate legal framework exists in the form of Information Technology Act, 2000 along with Indian Penal Code, 1860 to deal with cyber safety and cyber-crime issues. Further, amendment of law is an ongoing process to take care of emerging needs.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
