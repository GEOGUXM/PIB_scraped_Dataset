      Posted On: 18 JUL 2018 5:17PM by PIB Delhi


    The General Financial Rules (GFRs) lay down the general rules applicable to Ministries / Departments, and detailed instructions relating to procurement of goods are issued by the procuring departments broadly in conformity with the general rules, while maintaining flexibility to deal with varied situations.


    The Defence Procurement Procedure-2016 has been accordingly formulated keeping in view the unique features of supplier constraints, technological complexity and the emergent nature of procurements to maintain operational preparedness of the Armed Forces.


    This information was given by Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Dr. Ratna De (Nag) and Shri Naranbhai Kachhadiya in Lok Sabha today.
