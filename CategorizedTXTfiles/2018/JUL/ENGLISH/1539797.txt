    The Minister further informed thatNPPA is effectively monitoring the prices of scheduled as well as non-scheduled medicines under DPCO, 2013 so that these formulations are available to public at ceiling prices notified and no manufacturer of non-scheduled formulations can increase more than 10% in price as per provisions of DPCO, 2013. It takes action against companies found overcharging the consumers based on the references received from the State Drugs Controllers / individuals, samples purchased from the open market, reports from market based data and complaints reported through the grievance redressal websites; ‘Pharma Jan Samadhan’ and ‘Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS)’.
