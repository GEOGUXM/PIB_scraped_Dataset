Electoral Photo Identity Cards (EPIC) shall be the main document to of identification. However, in order to ensure that no voter is deprived of his/her franchise, if the voter’s name figures in the Electoral Rolls, separate instructions will be issued to allow additional documents for identification of voters in due course during the bye-election.


    The Model Code of Conduct shall come into force with immediate effect in the district(s) in which the whole or any part of the Assembly Constituency going for bye-election is included, subject to the partial modification as issued vide Commission’s instruction No. 437/6/INST2016-CCS, dated 29 th June, 2017 (available on the Commission’s website).
