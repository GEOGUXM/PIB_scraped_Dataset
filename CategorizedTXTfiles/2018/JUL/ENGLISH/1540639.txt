    A case has been registered by CBI against the accused officers in all 23 cases. The decision of Ministry of Defence for prosecution of the accused Government Servants in competent Criminal Courts has been conveyed to CBI in 16 cases.


    In order to ensure transparency, accountability, probity and level playing field,a panel of Independent External Monitors (IEMs) has been established for MES and BRO for monitoring high value defence contract procurements


    Besides, MES and BRO have established preventive vigilance mechanism under which periodic surprise vigilance checks are carried out as per Standard Operating Procedures. Both the organizations have also implemented e-tendering and e-payment process to root out any complaints of corruption in manual tendering and payments.


    The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) also examines the contracts and works carried out by MES and BRO through its Chief Technical Examiner. Any short comings are brought to the notice of the Ministry of Defence, which are taken to its logical conclusion by effecting changes in the system and procedure to root out any scope for corruption.
