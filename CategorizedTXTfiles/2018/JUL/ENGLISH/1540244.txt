    The Government has been promoting self defence training to girls under the erstwhile centrally sponsored scheme of Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA). Self-defence training is imparted to enhance safety and security of girls inside and outside of the school and to inculcate confidence amongst girls to deal with any emergency situation.


    The Central Government has launched an integrated scheme, for school education named as Samagra Shiksha w.e.f 2018-19, which subsumes the three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored schemes of school education i.e Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Centrally Sponsored Scheme on Teacher Education (CSSTE). Under Samagra Shiksha scheme there is provision for self defence training for Girls @ Rs. 9000 per school for schools having girls students in classes VI to XII.
