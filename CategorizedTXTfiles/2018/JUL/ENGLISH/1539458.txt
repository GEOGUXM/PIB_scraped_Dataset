    With an endeavor to provide a forum to the junior officers to put forth their views on aspects ranging across professional, technical, training and personnel issues, a Junior Officers Leadership Seminar was conducted by Eastern Fleet at Samudrika Auditorium on 18 Jul and 19 Jul 18. The seminar inaugurated by Vice Adm MS Pawar, Chief of Staff Eastern Naval Command (ENC) was attended by Rear Adm Suraj Berry Asst.

      Welcoming the delegates and participants, Vice Adm Pawar reiterated that as young leaders one should 'command' respect and not 'demand' it by following the time tested principle of ‘ Service before Self’ enshrined in the ethos of our defence officers since inception. The presentations and deliberations resulted in invigorating discussions which were moderated by prominent senior naval officers. The proceedings of the seminar were summed up eloquently by Rear Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi, Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet. An audio visual presentation of the lecture on leadership by the late Admiral RL Pereira, the former Chief of the Naval Staff was also played and as always made an impact.
