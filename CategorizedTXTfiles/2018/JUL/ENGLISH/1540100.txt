      Posted On: 25 JUL 2018 5:00PM by PIB Delhi


    Railways has identified the following areas/projects under Public-Private Partnership (PPP):-


     1. Building/strengthening of rail Connectivities;

     2. Private Container Train Operations;
     3. Building private freight terminals;
     4. Wagon investment/leasing schemes; and
     5. Redevelopment of stations.

    At present, the following stations have been identified for redevelopment through PPP mode : Charbagh (Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh), Ernakulam Junction (Kerala), Gomtinagar (Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh), Habibganj (Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh), Delhi Sarai Rohilla (Delhi), Jammu Tawi (Jammu & Kashmir), Kota (Rajasthan), Kozhikode (Kerala), Madgaon (Goa), Nellore (Andhra Pradesh), Puducherry (U.T. of Puducherry), Surat (Gujarat) and Tirupati (Andhra Pradesh) railway stations. Bhubaneshwar station in Odisha has been taken up for redevelopment through Partnership with the State Government.


    Re-development is an ongoing programme for which private developers are invited through open bidding process. Re-development of stations is planned through leveraging of commercial development of vacant land/air space in and around stations. A redeveloped station generally envisages provision of following amenities:


      * Segregation of arrival/departure of passengers.

      * Essential facilities at concourse.
      * Integration of both sides of city.
      * Integration with other modes of transport.
      * No parcel movement across the length of platform.
      * User friendly international signages etc.

    Stations redevelopment projects are complex in nature and require detailed techno-economic feasibility studies and statutory clearances from local bodies. Therefore, no time-frame can be indicated at this stage.


    This information was given by the Minister of State of Railways, Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
