    The Archaeological Survey of India, an organisation under the Ministry of Culture, Government of India, in an order issued today, decided to allow photography within the premises of all centrally protected monuments/sites (except 3). However, the 3 monuments/sites in which the photography would not be permitted are Ajanta Caves and LehPalace having paintings, and Mausoleum of Taj Mahal, Agra.


    The above comes in the wake of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi observing in his Speech at the Inaugural Event of ‘Dharohar Bhawan’ in New Delhi today that Space Technology in the modern era has developed to such an extent that one can photograph even minute objects from far off distances, and in this background , it is indeed ironical to restrict the tourists/visitors from taking photographs of their experiences at heritage monuments and sites.
