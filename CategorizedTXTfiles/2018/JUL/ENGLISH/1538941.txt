    The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has issued a notification increasing permissible truck axle load.


    As per the amended rules, the maximum safe axle weight of each axle type in relation to the transport vehicles (other than motor cabs), with regard to the size, nature and number of tyres would be as follows :


    Maximum Safe Axle Weight

    * Note: If the vehicle is fitted with pneumatic suspension, 1 tonne extra load is permitted for each axle.


    The amendment lays down that the gross vehicle weight (GVW) will not exceed the total permissible safe axle weight as above and in no case shall exceed-


         1. 49 tonnes in case of rigid vehicles; and

         1. 55 tonnes in case of semi-articulated trailers and truck-trailers except modular hydraulic trailers.

    It further lays down that Modular hydraulic trailers can carry goods of indivisible nature of any load subject to the regulatory approvals as may be required.


    Briefing correspondents about the decision in New Delhi yesterday Shri Nitin Gadkari, Minister of Road Transport & Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation said the decision to increase axle load was taken with a view to help in increasing the carrying capacity of goods transport vehicles and bring down logistics cost. He said the amendment will increase the carrying capacity of goods vehicles by about 20-25 % and lower logistics costs by about 2%. The Minister further said that while automobile technology and road construction quality have improved greatly over the years, the axle loads have remained the same since 1983 when they were last notified. There was a felt need to harmonize the axle load with international standards.


    Shri Gadkari also said that overloading rules will be implemented very strictly. State governments are also being requested to enforce the provisions against overloading very strictly and not allow vehicles to move till the excess load has been removed.
