The District and State level agencies conduct survey of the areas where roads are not available, such areas are planned to be covered with roads in coming 3 years.


    Also, the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is a one-time special intervention of the Union Government to provide rural connectivity, by way of single all-weather road to the eligible unconnected habitations in the core network. PMGSY is executed through State Governments. The primary objective of the PMGSY is to provide connectivity, by way of an all-weather road to the eligible unconnected Habitations in the rural areas with a population of 500 persons and above in Plain areas. In respect of the Hill States (North-East, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu &Kashmir and Uttarakhand), the Desert Areas (as identified in the Desert Development Programme), the Tribal (Schedule V) areas and Selected Tribal and Backward Districts the objective would be to connect eligible unconnected Habitations with a population of 250 persons and above. The Government of India has taken a decision to accelerate execution of all-weather road connectivity to eligible habitations as per the Core Network of PMGSY by March, 2019.
