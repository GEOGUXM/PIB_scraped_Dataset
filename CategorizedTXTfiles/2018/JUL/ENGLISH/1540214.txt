    Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), since its inception, has been driven by the objective of harnessing the benefits of space technology for national development and improving the lives of the people. The satellite enabled data and services are being used to improve the living standards of people. These include Television broadcasting, Direct-to-Home, ATM, Mobile communication, Tele-education, Tele-medicine and advisories on weather, pest infestation, agro-meteorology and potential fishing zones. Satellite data is also used for crop production estimation, crop intensification, agricultural drought assessment, wasteland inventory, identifying ground water prospect zones, inland aquaculture suitability and disaster risk reduction, which indirectly benefits the people


    In order to promote use of space technology for governance and public administration, Department of Space had formed expert working groups in ISRO for proactive interaction with the Government departments and prepared the joint action plan on “Effective use of Space Technology in Governance & Development”. These action plans were deliberated in One Day National Meet held in New Delhi in September 2015, with the participation of all the Central Government Ministries/Departments. 127 projects emerged out of this Meet, are being executed in the areas of Natural Resources Management, Planning, Monitoring & Decision Making and Disaster Risk Reduction.


    Further, to promote utilisation of space technology in State Government Departments, State level workshops have also been conducted in 17 states. Other measures include (i) institutionalisation of space applications in many Ministries/Departments, (ii) conduct of training sessions on space technology based applications at LBSNAA (DoPT) and training of Deputy Secretaries as part of ISTM Programs (DoPT).


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
