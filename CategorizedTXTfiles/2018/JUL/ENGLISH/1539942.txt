      The market rate of gram has reached around MSP levels, therefore Government has directed National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India, NAFED to start disposal of gram stock. In case of mustard, NAFED has been directed to submit a proposal within 3 days based on the market rates and area sown. Area sown for urad is little less than last yearâ€™s sown area. Therefore, NAFED was directed not to liquidate the urad stock for next 15 days and to review disposal based on sown area and market rates after a fortnight. It was observed that successful execution of procurement in coming kharif marketing season 2018 depends upon the disposal of procured commodities and making the godowns vacant for the coming season. It has been directed by the Ministry that old stocks be disposed off on FIFO (First in- First out) basis. This is especially important for disposal of tur, groundnut and summer moong and urad of Madhya Pradesh. This is important for maintaining the quality of stored commodities.
