    Background


    Gujarat has been one of the best performing states and has made significant progress in various macro-economic parameters in last decade or so. State GSDP growth rate has been higher than GDP growth of India since 2012-13 and it has been able to generate revenue surplus continuously since 2011-12. The capital expenditure increased continuously from ₹ 21,227 crore in 2012-13 to ₹ 24,169 crore in 2015-16, but decreased to ₹ 22,355 crorein 2016-17. State’s own tax revenue has increased continuously over the period 2012-17. State’s non-tax revenue has shown an increasing trend during the five year period 2013-17. State’s total outstanding debt as percentage of GSDP was 21.57 per cent in 2015-16 which was within the target of 25.91 per cent fixed by the 14 th Finance Commission.


    Notwithstanding, capital expenditure needs to keep pace to maintain the growth momentum. Gujarat has witnessed moderate growth in GST collections in the first year of its implementation. Commission will try to understand the efforts undertaken by States to improve GST collections. Gujarat is a Power surplus state with installed capacity of 27057 MW in 2016-17 against normal peak demand of 15203 MW. It has achieved reduction in T&D losses from 23.60 % in 2012-13 to 18% during 2016-17. 99.89% electrification of all villages has been achieved by March 2017.


    Poverty reduction in Gujarat has been faster than the national average. Gujarat is home to 60 million people, of whom one-sixth are poor. Despite performing fiscally well, Gujarat needs to catch up with the national average in Full Immunization, Sex-Ratio and Child Nutrition. Its IMR, MMR, TFR, Life expectancy at Birth, Literacy rate and per capita income are better than national average. State govt. has also submitted a detailed memorandum to the Commission for consideration.


    15 th Finance Commission till now has made significant progress in understanding the needs of Union government and various state governments through numerous meetings and state visits. Gujarat is the sixth state to be visited by the Commission followed by Jharkhand. Commission expects to gain an in-depth understanding of the recent developments and future possibilities of economic growth and development in Gujarat during its interactions and meetings with the state govt.
