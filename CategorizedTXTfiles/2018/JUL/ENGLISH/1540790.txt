      Reservation for Scheduled Castes
      Posted On: 31 JUL 2018 1:10PM by PIB Delhi


    The Constitution of India provides proportionate representation to Scheduled Castes in House of People, Legislative Assemblies of the States, Panchayats and Municipalities. Reservation in admission to educational institutions and services under the State is also available to Scheduled Castes under the Constitution. The Supreme Court has held that reservation in educational institutions and services under the State for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes should not ordinarily exceed 50%.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Vijay Sampla in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
