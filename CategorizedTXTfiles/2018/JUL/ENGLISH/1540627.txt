    Also, under Coal Mines Special Provision Act, 2015, 84 coal mines have been allocated. Further, directions have been issued to the Nominated Authority for allocation of 27 more coal mines (06 coal mines for the end use ‘Production of Iron and Steel, 13 coal mines for the end-use ‘Iron & Steel, Cement and Captive Power plants {excluding steel (coking)}’ 02 coal mines for State Government Company or Corporation for sale of coal, 06 coal mines for the purpose of own consumption for power).


    There is a gap between demand and domestic supply of coal which cannot be bridged completely as there is insufficient availability of coking coal and power plant designed on imported coal will continue to import coal for their production. However, for the Financial Year 2018-19, Ministry of Power has projected annual domestic coal requirement 615 MT (525 MT from Coal India Limited, 53 MT from Singareni Collieries Company Limited and 37 MT from Captive mines). This requirement is being met by supply of coal from domestic sources. Due to these efforts of enhanced domestic coal supply to power plants, the coal import by power plants has reduced from 80.58 MT in 2015-16 to 56.41 MT in 2017-18.
