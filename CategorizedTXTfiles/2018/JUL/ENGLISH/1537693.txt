      Posted On: 04 JUL 2018 6:03PM by PIB Delhi


    The Integrated Nodal Agency (INA), in its meeting held today under the chairpersonship of WCD Secretary, decided to issue one more Look-out-Circular(LoC).


    The Ministry has already issued 6 LoCs since April this year after examining the complaints received regarding NRI matrimonial disputes.


    The INA meets regularly to discuss issues related to NRI matrimonial disputes and chart the way forward . In criminal matters involving NRIâ€™s, LoC could be issued by the INA in cognizable offences, when the overseas husband is deliberately evading arrest or not appearing in the trial court despite Non Bailable Warrants and other coercive measures or there is a likelihood that he will leave the country to evade trial or arrest. The LoC will be issued after having the case scrutinised by NCW.
