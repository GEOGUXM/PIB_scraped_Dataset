      Posted On: 20 JUL 2018 4:38PM by PIB Delhi


    The average progress of commissioning of New Line, Gauge Conversion and Doubling during 2009-14 was 4.1 km per day. Further, 9528 km of New Line, Gauge Conversion and Doubling has been commissioned during 2014-2018 at an average progress rate of 6.53 km per day.


    The completion of Railway projects requires clearances from various departments of State Government and Central Ministries like acquisition of land, statutory clearances like forestry and wild life, shifting of utilities etc. leading to delay in completion of projects.


    For timely completion of the projects, Railway is holding regular meetings with State Government and concerned Central Government officials on various issues involving alignment, land acquisition, forestry and wild life clearances, law & order problems, shifting of utilities etc.


    This information was given by the Minister of State of Railways Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
