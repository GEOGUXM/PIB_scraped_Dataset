    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced and addressed the commemoration of the 3 rd anniversary of the Speaker’s Research Initiative (SRI) of the Lok Sabha in New Delhi today (July 24, 2018).


    Speaking on the occasion, the President said that the role of Parliament and Legislatures in democracy is to discuss, debate and decide. Occasionally, this process may entail an element of dissent. But in expression of dissent, MLAs and MPs have to maintain decorum. Due to the combination of these five Ds - discussion, debate, dissent, decorum and decision, the biggest D – democracy is strengthened.


    The President said that for the success of parliamentary democracy, it is necessary that all Members of Parliament respect each other’s views and maintain their dignity. He pointed out that Parliament's proceedings are broadcast live. The public expects discussions on its problems and plans for development of the country. It is Parliament’s responsibility to make efforts towards fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of our citizens.


    The President said that to ensure the majesty of democracy and the functioning of the legislature, it is not just important to take decisions. It is absolutely critical to take well considered decisions. This is where the role of research and knowledge comes in. The SRI initiative is a great help in this regard.
