The Expression of Interest document has been issued on 18.07.2018 and the same is available on PFRDA's website. Along with the other conditions, the actuarial firm should have carried out the actuarial valuation of at least 10 funds in the immediately preceding 5 financial years and out of which at least 2 of the funds should have had the minimum fund size of 5000 cr.
