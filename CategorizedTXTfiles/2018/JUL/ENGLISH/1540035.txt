      Prevention of Corruption Act
      Posted On: 25 JUL 2018 3:18PM by PIB Delhi


    The provision of section 13(1)(d)(iii) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 as it presently exists is as follows:


    “13. Criminal misconduct by a public servant.


    (1) A public servant is said to commit the offence of criminal misconduct,-


    …….


    if he,----


    ……..


    (iii) while holding office as a public servant, obtains for any person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage without any public interest;…….”


    The aforesaid provision does not carry the element of mens rea and thus does not confine such type of corruption to bribing of a public servant or any dishonest behavior by him. This raises apprehensions and fears in the mind of public servant which prima facie have the potential of impeding and slowing down decision making.


    The Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, 2013, for amending the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on 19.08.2013. The Bill after having been considered by the Department related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice, in its 69 th Report and the Law Commission of India in its 254 th Report, was also examined by the Select Committee of Rajya Sabha, which submitted its report on the Bill to the Rajya Sabha on 12th August, 2016.


    Recommendations made by the Select Committee in its report on the Bill were considered by the Government and official amendments were moved on the Bill as reported by the Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha.


    The Bill was taken up for discussion and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 19 th July, 2018 during its current 246 th Session. Further, it was taken up for discussion and passed by the Lok Sabha on 24 th July,2018 during its current 15 th Session of the 16 th Lok Sabha.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
