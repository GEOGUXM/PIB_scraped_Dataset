      Posted On: 31 JUL 2018 1:12PM by PIB Delhi


    Under Post Matric Scholarship Scheme for Scheduled Castes students (PMS-SC), Central assistance is considered for release over and above the committed liability of States/UTs. As per existing guidelines of PMS-SC Scheme, the level of Committed Liability of respective State Government/UT administration in a New Finance Commission Cycle annually will be equivalent to the total of the demand in the terminal year of the previous Plan Period/Finance Commission cycle, provided that when a state has made no demand on the Centre in the terminal year or the demand made by State is lower than in any of the previous years of Plan period/Finance Commission cycle, in that case the highest demand made in any of the previous financial years of the Plan/Finance Commission cycle will be considered as demand for purpose of computation of Committed Liability. North Eastern States are exempted from Committed Liability.


    Post Matric Scholarship Schemes to Scheduled Caste Students and Scheduled Tribe Students are two different schemes and for different target groups. The scheme is reviewed time to time and revised as per inter-ministerial consultation, availability of Budget and approval of Competent Authority. No time frame can be specified at this stage. Under Post Matric Scholarship Schemes to Scheduled Tribe Students, seventy five percent and twenty five percent of funds are shared by the Central Government and State Government respectively.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Vijay Sampla in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
