      Fertility of Soil

    A dedicated scheme on “Soil Health Card” has been launched to take care of Soil Health for the first time in a uniform manner to evaluate the soil fertility across the country by the GOI in cooperation with state governments Soil Health Card contains the status of soils with respect to 12 parameters, namely – N, P, K (Macro-nutrients), S (Secondary-nutrients), Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, B (Micro-nutrients) and pH, EC, OC (Physical Parameters). It also provides crop wise fertiliser recommendations. Soil Health Card helps farmers to improve productivity by maintaining soil health. SHC also promotes the judicious use of the fertilisers thus reducing the cost of cultivation.


    In all, 10.73 crore Soil Health Cards have been distributed during Cycle-I (2015-17) whereas 4.71 crore Soil Health Cards have been distributed to the farmers across the country during Cycle-II (2017-19).


    A GPS based unified criteria for Collection of Soil Samples at a grid of 2.5 ha in irrigated and 10 ha in rainfed areas are being adopted throughout the country as per suggestion of ICAR.


    To evaluate the extent of nutrient deficiencies in the soils, Soil Fertility Assessment and Nutrient Mapping is being done by the NRSC, Hyderabad, using soil health card data. Besides, based on soil test results available, nutrient maps are also being generated by the NIC which can be drilled down to the block / village and farmer level. Moreover, the ICAR through Indian Institute of Soil Science and All India Coordinated Research Projects (AICRPs) on Soil Test Crop Response (STCR) , Micro- and Secondary Nutrients and Pollutant Elements (MSNP) in soils and Plants , Long Term Fertilizer Experiments (LTFE) and Network Project on Soil Biodiversity-Biofertilizers are providing technological backstopping to various schemes related to soil fertility and fertilizer use in the country including Maharashtra. The ICAR imparts training, organises Front Line Demonstrations (FLDs) to educate farmers on soil test based balanced and integrated nutrient management through conjunctive use of both inorganic and organic sources (FYM, compost, biofertilizers etc.) of plant nutrients to improve soil fertility.


    A new scheme, “Soil Health Card” for every farmer at an interval of 2 years has been launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister on 19 th February, 2015 with an aim to assist state government and union territory to provide Soil Health Cards for all farm holdings across the country.


    Soil health card provides information to the farmers on fertility status of their soils to enables them to apply soil health card based recommended dosages of fertilizers including micro-nutrients, bio-fertilizers, manures as well as soil ameliorants so as to check the declining fertility of agriculture land and improve the fertility of soils to increase productivity across the country including Maharashtra besides enhancing farmers income.


    Government is implementing Soil Health Management and Soil Health Card Scheme to improve soil health and fertility. Under these schemes financial assistance are provided to State Governments and not farmers directly. State-wise fund released for the last three years and current financial year is given at Annexure-I & II respectively.


    A statement showing state-wise number of soil testing Centres are given at Annexure- III.
