    Display Boards and Public Announcement Systems are provided in Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) trains and prestigious trains like Humsafar, Tejas etc. Also, in Anubhuti coaches, Global Positioning System ( GPS) based passenger information system is provided in the Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitors hanging from the ceiling. Information like forthcoming station, destination, train running status and other safety information / announcement are provided in the monitors.


    At present, announcement in premium trains like Rajdhani and Shatabdi is being made about the next stations. The system is also being used for playing instrumental music and latest news.


    For the assistance of visually impaired passengers, Integrated Braille signage, i.e., signage superimposed with Braille scripts, are being provided in the newly manufactured coaches of Indian Railways. Retrofitment of the same in existing coaches has also been taken up in a phased manner.


    Recently, trial specifications have been developed by Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO) / Lucknow for GPS based Public Address System and Passenger Information System for Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches. Trials will now be conducted to assess the performance on coaches.
