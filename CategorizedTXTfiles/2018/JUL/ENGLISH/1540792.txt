    Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is implementing a Central Sector Scheme, ‘Self Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers’ (SRMS) under which identified manual scavengers and their dependents are provided the following rehabilitation benefits:


     1. Onetime cash assistance of Rs.40000/-.


     2. Loans upto Rs. 15.00 lacs at concessional rate of interest.


     3. Credit linked back end capital subsidy upto Rs. 3,25,000/-.


     4. Skill Development Training upto two years with stipend of Rs.3000/- per month.


    Ministry is also implementing a Scheme titled “Pre-Matric Scholarship scheme to the Children of those engaged in occupations involving cleaning and prone to health hazards”. Children of manual scavengers are also eligible for this scholarship.


    13 States have identified 13,657 manual scavengers up to 30.06.2018. State-wise details are given below. In addition, a National Survey of manual scavengers has been undertaken in 170 districts of 18 States to identify all those persons who were cleaning the insanitary latrines prior to their conversion into sanitary latrines under Swachh Bharat Mission. The survey also identifies those who are continuing to work as manual scavengers in some places. The process of survey has been completed in 155 of the 170 identified districts. In some States like Karnataka and West Bengal, the survey could not be undertaken as scheduled. On the basis of this survey 14,678 manual scavengers have been identified up to 23.7.2018.

    The Government has taken cognizance of the fact that the inhuman practice of manual scavenging is still continuing in the country. “Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (MS Act, 2013)” mandates survey of manual scavengers, if any municipality or Panchayat has reason to believe that some persons are engaged in manual scavenging within its jurisdiction. The above Act has come into effect from 06.12.2013.
