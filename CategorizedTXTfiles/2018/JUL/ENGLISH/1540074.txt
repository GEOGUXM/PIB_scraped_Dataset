    No personnel of J&K Police got killed in the incidents of ceasefire violations / cross border firing during last three years and current year ( upto June).


    Appropriate retaliation to these ceasefire violations has been carried out wherever necessary. During ceasefire violations, the inhabitants of border villages which are vulnerable to shelling / firing are shifted to safer locations to prevent any loss of life. All arrangements are made for free boarding, lodging, medicare, water, electricity, food, sanitation and transport to safer places in such cases. The defences along the border are adequately fortified to withstand fire. Continuous improvements, including the usage of modern technology, in the defences are made to make them more robust and resilient.


    The details of terrorists killed along the LoC / India-Pakistan Border in Jammu & Kashmir Border, in the last three years including current year (up to January, 2018) are as under:

    Governmentâ€™s consistent position is that United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) has outlived its relevance with the signing of the Simla Agreement in July 1972. India has lodged strong protests with Pakistan side at the continued unprovoked firing and ceasefire violations across the Line of Control and the International Boundary. Pakistan was asked to put an end to all kinds of support being given to cross border infiltration of terrorists, including through covering fire and adhere to the Ceasefire Understanding of 2003.
