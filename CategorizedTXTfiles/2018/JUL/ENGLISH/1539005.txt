    “India Meteorological Department (IMD) started sending SMS-based cyclone warning to central and state level disaster management agencies from 2010 and to general public through free of cost registration on the website since 2015. IMD launched a dedicated website for cyclones, viz. www.rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in - in the year 2014. The general public can register themselves through this website to receive SMS alert related to cyclonic disturbances over north Indian Ocean. SMS is sent to the registered users of the states likely to be affected due to cyclonic disturbances. In addition, the Area Cyclone Warning Centres and Cyclone Warning Centres also send SMS to state and district level disaster management agencies related to cyclonic disturbances over north Indian Ocean.


    Further the SMS-based cyclone warnings are also issued to registered farmers through the Kisan Portal of Ministry of Agriculture, Govt. of India. It is also sent to the registered fishermen through the SMS system of Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Hyderabad.


    For fishermen in deep sea, IMD is working in collaboration with ISRO and INCOIS to send SMS through satellite based communication system.


    There is a standard system established in IMD, in collaboration with Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DEITY) under the Digital India Programme.


    To receive SMS, the general public need to register themselves through the websites of IMD, INCOIS and Kisan Portal”.
