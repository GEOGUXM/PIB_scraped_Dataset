    The Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways, Shipping and Chemical & Fertilizers Shri Mansukh L Mandaviya in a written reply informed the Lok Sabha today that NITI Aayog has set up an Apex Committee and five Task Forces for carrying out R&Danddeveloping roadmap for implementing Methanol economy in India. Task Force on Production of Methanol using High Ash Coal is one of them and t he Government has notified G.S.R 490(E) dated 24 th May, 2018 regarding Mass Emission Standards for flex-fuel Methanol M15 or M100 and Methanol MD 95 vehicles.


    He further informed the house thatI ndia imported 212.7 Million Tons of Crude oil in 2016-2017. It is estimated that a 15% methanol blending can result in replacement of around 31.9 million tons of crude oil. With crude oil price of 54 $ per barrel it can result in significant savings for India. Further the CO and HC emission reduction for M 15 as compared to neat gasoline by approximate 40 % is an added benefit. Further CO2 and evaporative emission benefits are also envisaged.
