      Incidents of MOB Lynching
      Posted On: 25 JUL 2018 3:51PM by PIB Delhi


    The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) does not maintain specific data with respect to lynching incidents in the country. There have been media reports about incidents of lynching in Assam and in Maharashtra. ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibility to maintain law and order and protect life and property, therefore, rests with the respective State Governments. The State Governments are competent to deal with such offences under the extant provisions of laws. The Ministry of Home affairs have, however, issued advisory to the States and UTs, from time to time, to maintain law and order and ensure that any person who takes law into his/her own hand is punished promptly as per law. In the latest advisory issued to the States and UTs on 04.07.2018, State Governments and UT Administration have been advised to keep watch for early detection of such trends of circulation of rumours having potential for violence, and take all required measures to counter them effectively and to deal firmly with persons taking law into their own hands.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
