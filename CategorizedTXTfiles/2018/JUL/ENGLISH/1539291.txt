    The University Grants Commission (UGC) has informed that it has framed guidelines on Safety of Students on and off Campuses of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs). As per UGC guidelines, HEIs should mandatorily put in place a broad-based “Students Counseling System” for the effective management of problems and challenges faced by students. It is a unique, interactive and target-oriented system, involving students, teachers and parents, resolved to address common students concerns such as anxiety, stress, fear of change and failure to homesickness and a slew of academic worries. HEIs should also make self defense for women mandatory component of extra-curricular activities. Further, it is incumbent upon HEIs to institute a mechanism to address issues/concerns of all girls and women in HEIs. The aforesaid guidelines may be seen at https://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/4006064_Safety-of-Students-Guidelines.pdf .


    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Dr. Satya Pal Singh today in a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question.
