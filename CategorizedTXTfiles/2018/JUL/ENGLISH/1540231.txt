      Village Development Plan Vis-A-Vis Living Standards of SC Concentrated Villages
      Posted On: 26 JUL 2018 3:20PM by PIB Delhi


    Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana (PMAGY) aims at overall development of selected SC majority villages so as to provide them with all the necessary facilities to ensure that the disparity between SC and non-SC population in terms of common socio-economic indicators is eliminated and the indicators are raised to at least the level of the national average. The performance of the scheme is being monitored in terms of achievement of the targets listed out in the Village Development Plan (VDP) prepared for each village.


    Under the PMAGY the National Institute of Rural Development & Panchayati Raj (NIRD&PR) has been identified to provide technical resource support at the national level. At the State level, the State Govts. are to identify suitable Institutions for the purpose and the final view has to be taken by the concerned State Govts. in consultations with the Ministry.


    A list of Institutions selected during the pilot phase including Himachal Pradesh is given below:
