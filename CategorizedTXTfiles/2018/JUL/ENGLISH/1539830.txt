      Posted On: 24 JUL 2018 3:54PM by PIB Delhi


      The Government of India is implementing “Allocation of foodgrains under Welfare Institutions and Hostels Scheme” with effect from 01.09.2017. This scheme was launched after the merger of two schemes i.e. Welfare Institutions Scheme and SC/ST/OBC Hostels Scheme. Allocation of foodgrains under the scheme is made to State Governments/Union Territory Administrations to meet the requirements of Welfare Institutions viz. Charitable Institutions such as beggar homes, nari-niketans and other similar welfare institutions, sponsored by State Governments/Union Territory Administrations that are not covered under Targeted Public Distribution System or any other Welfare Scheme. The allocation of foodgrain for the residents/students of SC/ST/OBC Hostels is made in order to ensure adequate standards of nutrition in institutions meant for the welfare and development of weaker sections of the society.


      Under the scheme, the allocation of foodgrain is made for all the residents/students of the SC/ST/OBC hostels subject to the condition that 2/3rd of the inmates belong to the SC/ST/OBC community. The beneficiary institutions/hostels are entitled to receive foodgrains at BPL prices with an upper ceiling of maximum of 15 kg per beneficiary per month.


      Allocation of foodgrain under the scheme is made by Department of Food & Public Distribution on the basis of the requests received from the States/UTs, as per extant norms.


      The scheme is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central Government and State Governments/UT Administrations. The Central Government is responsible for procurement, storage and its allocation to the States/UTs. State Governments/UT Administrations are responsible for lifting the allocated foodgrains and its distribution within the States/UTs and in ensuring the allocated foodgrains reach the targeted beneficiaries. During the current financial year, so far more than 37 lakh inmates/boarders in 17 states/UTs have availed benefit under the scheme.


      This information was given by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution , Shri C.R. Chaudhary today in Lok Sabha.
