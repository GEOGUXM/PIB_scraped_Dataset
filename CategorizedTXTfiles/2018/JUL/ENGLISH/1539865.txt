      Posted On: 24 JUL 2018 4:59PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government is implementing Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), a centrally sponsored health insurance scheme which covers BPL families (a unit of five) and 11 other defined categories namely Building & Other Construction Workers, licensed Railway porters, Street Vendors, MGNREGA workers (who have worker for more than fifteen days during preceding financial year), Beedi workers, Domestic workers, Sanitation workers, Mine workers, Rickshaw pullers, Rag pickers and Auto/Taxi drivers, who are enrolled under RSBY. They are entitled for cashless health insurance coverage of Rs. 30, 000/- per annum per family. Beneficiaries need to pay only Rs. 30/- at the time enrolment.


    Senior Citizen’s Health Insurance Scheme (SCHIS) for Senior Citizens of age 60 years and above belonging to above said categories has also been implemented w.e.f. 01.04.2016 as top of RSBY. The health coverage is upto Rs. 30,000/- per annum per senior citizen for treatment packages, over and above RSBY entitlement.


    The details of target set and achievement made during the last two years including Assam and North Earthen States is at Annexure.


    There was no substantial reduction in the central share release under RSBY during the year 2016-17. The reduction in release of central share is due to decrease in number of implementing States.
