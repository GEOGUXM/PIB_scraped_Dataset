The index for ‘Manufacture of Beverages’ group rose by 0.3 percent to 119.9 (provisional) from 119.5 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of country liquor (2%) and beer and spirits (1% each). However, the price of bottled mineral water (2%) and rectified spirit (1%) declined.

The index for ‘Printing and Reproduction of Recorded Media ‘group declined by 0.1 percent to 146.4 (provisional) from 146.6 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of printed form & schedule, sticker plastic and journal/periodical (1% each). However, the price of hologram (3d) and newspaper (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Computer, Electronic and Optical Products’ group declined by 0.3 percent to 111.3 (provisional) from 111.6 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of electro-diagnostic apparatus, used in medical, surgical, dental or veterinary sciences (3%), capacitors and meter (non-electrical) (2% each) and telephone sets including mobile hand sets (1%). However, the price of colour tv (1%) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Electrical Equipment’ group rose by 0.3 percent to 111.6 (provisional) from 111.3 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of solenoid valve (6%), fibre optic cables, light fitting accessories and rubber insulated cables (2% each) and ACSR conductors, generators & alternators, aluminium wire, electric accumulators, electrical relay/conductor, transformer, electric & other meters and insulating & flexible wire (1% each). However, the price of jelly filled cables, rotor/magneto rotor assembly and electric switch (2% each) and electric mixers/grinders/food processors, fan and electric switch gear control/starter (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Machinery and Equipment’ group rose by 0.4 percent to 110.3 (provisional) from 109.9 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of pressure vessel & tank for fermentation & other food processing (7%), cranes (6%), filtration equipment (4%), road roller (3%), hydraulic equipment and pneumatic tools (2% each) and pharmaceutical machinery, lathes, industrial valve, oil pump, material handling, lifting & hoisting equipment, gasket kit, mining, quarrying & metallurgical machinery/parts, air gas compressor including compressor for refrigerator, threshers and excavator (1% each). However, the price of air or vacuum pump and moulding machine (3% each), conveyors-non-roller type and injection pump (2% each) and packing machine, solar power system (solar panel & attachable equipment), hydraulic pump, roller & ball bearings, printing machinery, deep freezers and manufacture of bearings, gears, gearing & driving elements (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Motor Vehicles, Trailers and Semi-Trailers’ group rose by 0.2 percent to 111.9 (provisional) from 111.7 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of crankshaft (4%), passenger vehicles (2%) and shafts of all kinds, release valve, chain and chassis of different vehicle types (1% each). However, the price of brake pad/brake liner/brake block/brake rubber, others and cylinder liners (3% each) and radiators & coolers (1%) declined.
