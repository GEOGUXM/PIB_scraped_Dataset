      Import of Natural Gas
      Posted On: 23 JUL 2018 5:51PM by PIB Delhi


    Union Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan has said that in order to promote gas usage and to increase use of cleaner fuel and making Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) more affordable to end users in the industries, Government vide notification No. 6/2017-Customs, dated 2nd February, 2017 has reduced the basic customs duty on LNG from 5 per cent to 2.5 percent.


    In a written reply in Lok Sabha today, he said that LNG Cargo of Russian natural gas under the long term contract between GAIL India Limited and Gazprom Marketing & Trading Singapore (GMTS) of Russia was received on 4th June, 2018. The gas price is negotiated between parties depending on many factors like project location, duration of contract, pricing formula, etc. GAIL India Limited and Gazprom successfully re-negotiated the long-term LNG Sale and Purchase Agreement reflecting the current global gas market dynamics. The renegotiated price, compared to earlier contract price, will result in saving of approximately ₹ 8500 crore (crude oil at US $50 per barrel) or ₹ 9000 Crore (crude oil at US$60 per barrel) or ₹ 9500 crore (crude oil at US$70 per barrel) for the years 2018 to 2040. Import Price per unit of LNG under GMTS contract is very competitive and currently cheaper than other long-term LNG supplies being received by GAIL at any delivery port in India.


    Following long-term LNG contracts have been signed by Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and its Joint Ventures (JVs) with various countries:
