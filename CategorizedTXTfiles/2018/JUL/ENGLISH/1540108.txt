      Posted On: 25 JUL 2018 5:05PM by PIB Delhi


    Indian Railways have planned to install environment-friendly bio-toilets in railway coaches. For this, all new coaches, being turned out from coach Production Units of Indian Railways, are fitted with bio-toilets and all railway workshops have been instructed to retro-fit bio-toilets in all the existing in-service eligible coaches undergoing mid-life rehabilitation and periodical overhaul. Retro-fitment of bio-toilets is also being done in coaching depots.


    As of now, approximately 70% of the total passenger carrying coaches over Indian Railways have been installed with bio-toilets and it is proposed to complete the work of installation of bio-toilets in balance coaches by the year 2019.


    This information was given by the Minister of State of Railways, Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
