      Posted On: 23 JUL 2018 3:52PM by PIB Delhi


    As per the information received from the States/UTs, the number of employment exchanges functioning in the country (as on January, 2016) are 997 including Maharashtra, Bihar and Jharkhand. The State-wise detail is at Annexure-I.


    The Ministry is implementing the National Career Service (NCS) Project as a plan scheme for transformation of the National Employment Service to provide a variety of employment related services like job matching, career counselling, vocational guidance, information on skill development courses, etc. These services are available online on the National Career Service Portal (www.ncs.gov.in) and supported by a Call Centre/Helpdesk. The services under NCS are accessible from multiple delivery channels like NCS Portal, Employment Exchanges (Career Centres), Common Service Centre etc.


    The NCS Project envisages setting up of Model Career Centres (MCCs) in collaboration with States and other institutions of repute to deliver employment services. Ministry has approved 68 Employment Exchanges for establishment of Model Career Centres. The Government provides financial assistance to these centres based on the proposals and scheme guidelines. The State-wise details of funds approved and released are at Annexure-II. These Model Career Centres can be replicated by the States from their own resources.


    In addition, the NCS project has a component of interlinking of employment exchanges with NCS and provides part funding to States for upgradation of infrastructures in employment exchanges. The Government provides part financial assistance based on the proposals received from states and scheme guidelines. Funds have been released to 23 States/UTs as per details at Annexure-III.
