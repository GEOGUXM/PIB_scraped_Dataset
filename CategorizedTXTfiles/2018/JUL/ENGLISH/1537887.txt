    During his two-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir, the Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh reviewed the security situation and developmental issues in the State at a high-level meeting in Srinagar today. State Governor Shri NN Vohra, National Security Adviser Shri Ajit Doval, Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba and senior officers of MHA and State Government were present.


    The Union Home Minister reiterated the Government’s commitment to take all possible measures that would bring accountability, transparency and good governance in the system. With renewed focus on Good Governance and development, the Centre is looking forward to kindle new aspirations and hopes amongst the people of the State, he added.

The solution to problems lies in empowerment of the people and strengthening the institutions of local self-governance.


    The Union Home Minister said the dream of a developed and prosperous Jammu and Kashmir would be realised when there is peace and normalcy in the state. It is the Government’s firm resolve to bring peace, stability and prosperity through an honest, effective and efficient administration for the problems facing the state, he added.
