    The Chancellor of Central University Jammu, Shri Gopalaswami Parthasarathy called on the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh here today and spent over 45 minutes discussing issues of mutual interest, related to academic subjects and J&K affairs.


    78-year-old Shri G. Parthasarathy, who has been recently appointed as the Chancellor, is a career diplomat and an expert on strategic issues.


    Dr Jitendra Singh shared with Shri Parthasarathy, his recent initiative to start a teaching Department of Space Technology in the Central University Jammu and, for this purpose, he said, it had been decided to have as Advisor, the renowned Space Scientist Dr K. Radhakrishnan who, as former ISRO Chairman, was instrumental in planning the prestigious "Mangalyan" mission.


    Dr Jitendra Singh said that in present competitive times, certain exclusive departments/streams are essential to impart a definite identity to any University or teaching institution. He hoped that the Central University of Jammu would also focus on this consideration in order to emerge as a distinct seat of learning, which could attract scholars from far and wide.
