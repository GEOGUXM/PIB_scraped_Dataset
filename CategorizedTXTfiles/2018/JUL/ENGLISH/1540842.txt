      High cost on medical expenditure
      Posted On: 31 JUL 2018 4:36PM by PIB Delhi


    As per a recently published research paper based on cross-sectional analysis of National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) data, 55 million Indians were pushed into poverty in a single year because of having to fund their own healthcare, and out of this, 38 million fell below the poverty line due to spending on medicines alone.


    It is true that the total expenditure on out-patient care is significantly higher than the in-patient care. Further, as per the 71 st Round (January-June 2014) of the National Sample Survey Office(NSSO) on Health in India, purchase of medicine accounted for around 72% in rural sector, and 68% in urban sector, of the total expenditure on non-hospitalized treatment of ailments.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Smt Anupriya patel stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
