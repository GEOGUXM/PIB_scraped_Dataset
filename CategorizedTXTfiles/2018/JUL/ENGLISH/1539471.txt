      Posted On: 20 JUL 2018 4:53PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government is working to develop inland waterways as an alternative mode of transport in the country, which is cleaner and cheaper than both road and rail transport. There are 111 National Waterways in the country today, after 106 waterways were declared as National Waterways, adding to the list of 5 existing NW, in 2016.


    Some of the National Waterways in the country are already operational/ navigable and are being used for transportation. These are detailed in the following table:

    The Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) is working on developing the new National Waterways and enhancing their navigational potential. The development work is preceded by a feasibility study which inter-alia covers the potential of navigability, cargo availability, cost of development etc.of the NW concerned. Work is then initiated on waterways that are found feasible for development. As per the feasibility reports completed so far, 36 NWs have been found to be technically viable. Out of these 36 NWs, developmental activities have been initiated on the following 8 NWs in 2017-18.

    IWAI has set up a mechanism to monitor the waterway through regular surveys and channel inspection. Regular fortnightly hydrographic surveys are conducted to determine the available depth and possible shoal formations in the channel and to notify the obstructions, clearances available at cross structures. A constant vigil is kept on the river behavior and plans accordingly to ensure fairway for safe movement of vessels. Based on the observation during channel inspection, River Notices are issued and placed on the IWAI website with details on Least Available Depth (LAD), clearances at bridge structures etc. along with any specific information to be conveyed to shippers.
