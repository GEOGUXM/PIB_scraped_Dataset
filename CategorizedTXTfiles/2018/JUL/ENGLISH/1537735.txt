    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted with over 170 young IAS officers (2016 Batch) who have recently been appointed Assistant Secretaries in the Government of India.


    The Prime Minister encouraged them to share their experiences of field training. He discussed with them, some of the elements of good governance, including Jan Bhagidaari, information flows, optimal utilisation of resources, and people's trust in governance.


    Recent governance initiatives such as Gram Swaraj Abhiyan, Aspirational districts and Ayushman Bharat, also came up for discussion, which will be included in this year’s programme.


    MoS (PP) Dr. Jitendra Singh said that the experiment of posting Assistant Secretaries in Central Ministries, which was started 3 years ago under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, received overwhelming positive response from the young IAS officers of the previous batches. He urged the young officers to be part of ‘Team India’ in contributing to the Making of ‘New India’.


    A short film on the program of attaching of Assistant Secretaries in Central Government was also screened during the event.


    The Cabinet Secretary, Shri P. K. Sinha, Secretary (DoPT) Shri P. Chandramouli and other senior officers also attended the function.
