    Department of Food and Public Distribution is implementing a scheme on ‘End-to-End Computerization of TPDS Operations’. Component-I of the scheme comprises digitization of ration cards/beneficiary other database, online allocation, computerization of supply chain management, setting up of transparency portal and grievance redressal mechanisms. Under the scheme, ration cards/beneficiaries database have been completely digitized in all States/UTs, transparency portal and online grievance redressal facility/Toll-free number have been implemented in all States/UTs, online allocation has been implemented in 30 States/UTs and supply chain management has been computerized in 21 States/UTs. Component-II of scheme comprises automation of Fair Price Shops (FPSs), which involves installation of electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) devices at FPSs for authentication of beneficiaries and electronic recording of sale transactions. As per information received from States/UTs, out of total 5.29 lakh FPSs across the country, more than 3.33 lakh FPSs have been automated so far. Since some of the States/UTs could not complete all activities under the scheme within the plan period, the validity of the scheme has been extended upto 31.3.2019 without any escalation in the cost of the project to allow such States to complete the project.
