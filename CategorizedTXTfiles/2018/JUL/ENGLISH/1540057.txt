      MOB Lynching on suspicion of child lifting
      Posted On: 25 JUL 2018 3:46PM by PIB Delhi


    The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) does not maintain specific data with respect to lynching incidents in the country. ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibility to maintain law and order and protect life and property, therefore, rests with the respective State Governments. The State Governments are competent to deal with such offences under the extant provisions of laws. The Ministry of Home Affairs have, however, issued advisory to the States and UTs, from time to time, to maintain law and order and ensure that any person who takes law into his/her own hand is punished promptly as per law. Such an advisory was also issued to the States and UTs on 04.07.2018 wherein State Governments and UT Administration have been advised to keep watch for early detection of such trends of circulation of rumours having potential for violence, and take all required measures to counter them effectively and to deal firmly with persons taking law into their own hands. Through this advisory, State Governments have also been advised that complaints of kidnapping or abduction of children are promptly acted upon and in a manner that instills a sense of confidence in the affected family or locality that action as per law would be taken and the guilty would be brought to book.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
