    In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act (RTE) Act, 2009 have been amended on 20th February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage (classes 1 to 8) have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for studentâ€™s capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.


    To assess the learning levels of the students in Classes 3, 5 and 8 National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) conducted the National Achievement Survey (NAS) on 13 th February, 2017 in which approximately 22 lakh children across the country participated. NAS at the elementary level was based on the Learning Outcomes developed by the NCERT. The design and implementation of the survey included in its ambit the school leaders, teachers and the whole network of officials at the Cluster, Block, District Institute of Education and Training (DIET), State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) and the Directorates of Education in the different States/ UTs.


    NCERT similarly conducted NAS for class 10 on February 05, 2018. The survey tools used multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Language, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. The attainment of the learning levels of nearly 15 lakh students was assessed. District report cards (provisional) for NAS 2018 for class X have been released and are available on MHRD website.


    Learning levels of children assessed under Nas 2017:
