    As ‘Police’ is a subject, falling in List-II of the Seventh Schedule (State list) of the Constitution of India, the modernisation of police stations is the primary responsibility of the States. However, to supplement the efforts of the States for equipping and modernizing their police forces, under the scheme of Modernisation of Police Forces (MPF), the States have been provided central assistance for acquisition of latest weaponry, training gadgets, advanced communication and forensic equipment etc. The scheme has been continued for the period from 2017-18 to 2019-20 with the new name ‘Assistance to States for Modernisation of Police’.


    The States are grouped into two categories, namely Category ‘A’ and Category ‘B’ for the purpose of funding. Category ‘A’ States, namely, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and 8 North Eastern States including Sikkim, are eligible to receive financial assistance on 90:10 Centre: State sharing basis. The remaining States including the State of Andhra Pradesh are in Category ‘B’ and eligible for financial assistance on 60:40 Centre: State sharing basis. The allocation to the States is based on a pre-determined criteria. So far as State of Andhra Pradesh is concerned an amount of Rs. 44.13 crore has been allocated for the year 2018-19.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
