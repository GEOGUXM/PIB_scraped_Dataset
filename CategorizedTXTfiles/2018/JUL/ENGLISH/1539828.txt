      Waiving off Agricultural loan
      Posted On: 24 JUL 2018 3:54PM by PIB Delhi


    The Union Government, at present, is not considering any loan waiver Scheme for farmers, as such, waivers may impact the credit culture of a State by incentivising the defaulters, even if they are in a position to repay the loan, and thus, create/amplify the moral hazard by discouraging those borrowers who have been regular in repaying their loans. Further, each waiver granted makes it even more difficult to reject any future similar demand.


    Reportedly, various State Governments including Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Union Territory (UT) of Puducherry have in the recent past announced their own farm loan/debt waiver Schemes to extend relief to the needy farmers. The details of debt/loan waiver announced by these States/UT is given at Annexure.
