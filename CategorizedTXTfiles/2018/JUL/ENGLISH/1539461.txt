  * A work for daily track health monitoring through deploying Axle Box Level Accelerometers on one/two bogies of Rajdhani type trains on Group–A route has been sanctioned. This will ensure daily monitoring of track defects on routes covered.                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
  * Indian Railways has already adopted the technological upgradation in safety aspects of coaches and wagons by way of introducing Modified Centre Buffer couplers, Bogie Mounted Air Brake System (BMBS). Improved suspension design and provision of Automatic fire and smoke detection system in coaches are being carried out which would eventually lead to enhanced safety standards.
