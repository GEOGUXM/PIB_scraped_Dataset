     1. Merchandise Exports in September 2018 exhibited a positive growth of 9.65 per cent in Rupee terms. In dollar terms there was a marginal negative growth in merchandise exports of 2.15 per cent in September 2018. This decline is entirely due to the base effect resulting from September 2017 being an abnormally high growth month of about 26% in dollar terms due to the imminent cut off then for drawbacks at pre-GST rates.
