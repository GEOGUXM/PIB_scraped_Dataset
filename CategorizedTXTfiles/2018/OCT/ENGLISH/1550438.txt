    The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the signing of Bilateral Investment Agreement (BIA) between India Taipei Association (ITA) in Taipei and Taipei Economic and Cultural Center (TECC) in India.


    The BIA is likely to increase investment flows between the parties. It will provide appropriate protection to investments on a reciprocal basis between ITA and TECC. BIA is likely to increase the comfort level and boost the confidence of investors by assuring a level playing field and non-discrimination in matters related to investments, thus providing conducive investment climate to investors. It would help project India as a preferred foreigndirect investment (FDI) destination.
