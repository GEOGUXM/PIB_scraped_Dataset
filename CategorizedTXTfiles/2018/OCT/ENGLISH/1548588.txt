Regarding the specific demand for ID Cess and Purchase Tax on Wheat (RMS 2017-18) stocks in hand as on 30 th June 2017, Rs. 708.26 crore is the admissible amount for Punjab out of which 50% of the amount has already been paid while payment of balance 50% amount for Purchase Tax & ID Cess has been processed and is under examination.


    Regarding the demand for Subsidy under National Food Security Act for 2 nd and 3 rd quarter 2018, Shri Paswan said that due to issues with the submitted advance subsidy claim provided by the State to the Ministry, the claims could not be processed and the State had been advised to submit the bills in proper format. State has submitted rectified claims on 4.10.2018 which will be examined. Further, for disbursement of subsidy in future, State has been advised to implement PFMS fully as per directive of Ministry of Finance and ensure use of EAT Module by IAs.It was also stated that for the Financial Year 2017-18, 796.33 crores have been released.


    Regarding the Custody & Maintenance Charges for Paddy, FCS up to KMS 2013-14 years have been issued by the Department. For future cases, State Government may present their claims during the time of finalization. FCI has also released Rs. 300 crore based on data/information submitted by State Government/Agencies as per FCS. The clarification sought by FCI is being examined.


    The Punjab Chief Minister also requested for reimbursement of Custody and Maintenance Charges on the storage of wheat in open plinths in Punjab from the year 2007-08 onwards. Shri Paswan stated that this matter was examined in the Department and since State Govt. of Punjab could not produce any relevant documents/ supporting documents at the time of finalization of Cost Sheet, the Department of Food based on available documents finalized the Cost Sheet. Also, a view has been taken that all the closed issues prior to 2014-15 need not be reopened and there should not be any retrospective review of the decisions already taken.
