    Union Minister of Textiles, Smriti Zubin Irani, will inaugurate the 6 th edition of India International Silk Fair (IISF) in New Delhi on October 16, 2018. Minister of State for Textiles, Ajay Tamta will also be present on the occasion.


    India is the 2 nd largest producer of silk in the world. The silk industry is agriculture based and labour intensive and provides gainful employment to around 8 million artisans and weavers in rural areas.


    Over 108 exhibitors of silk and blended silk products manufactured in different parts of the country will display their produce during the three-day event, organised by the Indian Silk Export Promotion Council (ISEPC) at Pragati Maidan. Over 218 buyers from various countries will participate in the fair. Artisans from Jammu & Kashmir and North East will showcase their unique products from their region which will be an added attraction for buyers.


    The fair will give a platform to exporters to display their products and to overseas buyers an opportunity to place orders and source their merchandize. The IISF-2018 is expected to generate business of over USD 20 million for the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) engaged in producing silk and blended silk garments, fabrics, accessories and floor covering.


    The Central Silk Board is putting up a Theme Pavilion showcasing the future vision of Indian Silk Industry. The fair is open for buyers and sellers and invited visitors only.
