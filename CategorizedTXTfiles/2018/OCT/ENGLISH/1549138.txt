    The Severe Cyclonic Storm ‘TITLI’ over west central Bay of Bengal moved northwards with a speed of about 14 kmph during past 06 hours, and lay cantered at 0830 hrs IST of today, over West central Bay of Bengal, about 320 km south-southeast of Gopalpur (Odisha) and 270 km southeast of Kalingapatnam (Andhra Pradesh). It is very likely to intensify further into a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm during next two hours.


    It is very likely to move north-north westwards and cross Odisha & adjoining north Andhra Pradesh coasts between Gopalpur & Kalingapatnam around morning of 11th October. Thereafter, it is very likely to re-curve north eastwards, move towards Gangetic West Bengal across Odisha and weaken gradually.


    Red alert has been issued for districts of north Andhra Pradesh & south Odisha coasts. Union Minister for earth sciences Dr. Harsh Vardhan yesterday evening took an urgent review meeting and the situation is being monitored at the highest level.
