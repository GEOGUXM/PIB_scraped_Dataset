    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:


         1. Crude oil production by ONGC during September, 2018 was 1711.27 TMT which is 7.71%lower than the monthly target and7.21%lower when compared with September, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-September, 2018 was 10676.15 TMT which is 4.83%lower than target for the period andlowerby 5.54% thanproduction during corresponding period of last year. Reason for shortfall are as under:


      * ESP problem in wells of NBP field.

      * Less than planned production from WO-16 and B-127 fields in the absence of MOPUsSagarSamrat and SagarLaxmi.
      * Sub-sea leakage in some well fluid lines of Mumbai High &NeelamHeera Asset, resulting in flow restrictions.

         1. Crude oil production by OIL during September, 2018 was274.28 TMT which is 10.29%lower than monthly target and 0.91% lower when compared with September, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-September, 2018 was 1685.69 TMT which is 6.00% lower than target for the period andmarginally lower by 0.49% than production during the corresponding period of last year. Major reason for lower production is less than planned contribution from work over wells and drilling wells.


         1. Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during September, 2018 was 812.30 TMT which is 2.75% lower than the monthly target but 1.65% higher than September, 2017.Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-September, 2018 was 5047.61 TMT which is 1.67% lower than target for the period but marginally higher by0.37% than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Major reason for lower production is closing of wells due to high water cut; require WOJ and liquid handling constraint at MPT plant.


    2.Natural Gas


    Natural gas production during September, 2018 was 2684.20 MMSCM which is 7.56% lower than the target for the month and1.43% lower when compared with September, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production during April-September, 2018 was 16254.65MMSCM which is 7.75% lower than target for the period but0.96% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year.Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II . Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of September, 2018 and cumulatively for the period April-September, 2018 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

    Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production


         1. Natural gas production by ONGC during September, 2018 was 2005.99 MMSCM which is 5.56% lower than the monthly targetbut 3.53% higher when compared with September, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC duringApril-September, 2018 was 12017.82MMSCM which is 5.99% lower than the cumulative target but2.93% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year.The reasons for shortfall are as under:


              o Gas Production from Eastern Offshore restricted. The new 24” Pipeline being laid by M/s GAIL is expected to be completed by end Oct’2018.

              o Less than planned gas production from WO-16 and B-127 fields in the absence of MOPUs SagarSamrat and SagarLaxmi.

         1. Natural gas production by OIL during September, 2018 was 228.37 MMSCM which is 12.98% lower than the monthly targetand7.18% lower than September, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-September, 2018 was 1365.78 MMSCM which is 14.10% lower than the cumulative target and7.80% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year.The reason for shortfall is due to lower gas production potential on account of loss of production from few high production wells in Deohal area.


         1. Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during September, 2018 was 449.84 MMSCM which is 13.00% lower than the monthly target and16.63% lower when compared with September, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-September, 2018 was 2871.04MMSCM which is 11.54% lower than the cumulative target and11.83% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * Panna-Mukta: Gas production lower due to wells underperformance and water loading post unplanned shutdown (SHELL).

      * KG-DWN-98/3: Closure of 2 wells in D1D3 and MA field ceased production. Well B6 ceased to flow due to low reservoir pressure (RIL).
      * Sohagpur West CBM Block: Underperformance of CBM wells (RIL).
      * Raniganj East CBM Block: Some wells closed for refrac jobs. Major customer 'Matix' under operational shutdown (NEL/ESSAR).

     1. Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)


    Refinery production during September, 2018 was 20851.48TMT which is 2.18%higher than the target for the month and1.28%higherwhen compared with September, 2017. Cumulative production during April-September, 2018 was 128657.96 TMT which is 2.09% higher than the target for the period and5.03% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III . Company-wise production for the month of September, 2018 and cumulatively for the period April-September, 2018 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

    Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production


         1. CPSE Refineries’ production during September, 2018 was 12302.80TMT which is 1.45%higher than the target for the month and 8.96%higher when compared with September, 2017. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-September, 2018 was 74795.12 TMT which is 2.17% higher than the target for the period and 6.59% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


      * IOCL, Barauni: Throughput is lower due toGas Oil ullage constraint due to HSD containment and DHDT interruption.

      * IOCL, Gujarat: Throughput is lower due to low North Gujarat Crude.
      * IOCL, Paradip: Throughputis lower due to CCRU interruption and HSD containment due to HSD tanker berthing delay.

    3.2 Production in JV refineries during September, 2018 was 1012.94TMT which is 14.59% higher than the target for the month but 37.50% lowerwhen compared with September, 2017. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-September, 2018 was 8718.97 TMT which is 7.44% higher than the target for the period and34.44%higherthan the production during corresponding period of last year.Reason for shortfall in throughput is due to shutdown in BORL on account of its planned turnaround which commenced on 17.08.2018.


    3.3 Production in private refineries during September, 2018 was 7535.74TMT which is higherby 1.90% than the target for the month but1.83% lowerwhen compared with September, 2017. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-September, 2018 was 45143.87 TMT which is 1.00% higher than the target for the period butlowerby 1.52% compared to production during corresponding period of last year.


      3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of September, 2018 and cumulatively for the period April-September, 2018 vis-à-vis April-September, 2017 are given at Annexures -IV and V respectively.
