    The Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has said that Northeast tourism has reached new heights in the last four years and this has been possible because of special thrust and impetus given by the Union government, with the direct indulgence of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.


    Interacting with the members of a young Start-Up group here today, after launching the Northeast Tourism app developed by them, Dr Jitendra Singh said, fast-track progress in providing connectivity to distant areas in the region has inspired tourists from far and wide to look forward to Northeast as a favourite holiday destination. In addition, he said, the Ministry of DoNER undertook a campaign showcasing Northeast across the country, which has also generated unusual interest among potential tourists.


    Dr Jitendra Singh pointed out that some of the Northeast destinations like Gangtok, Sikkim and Shillong, Meghalaya have started attracting such heavy rush of tourists that during the last two years, there have been occasions when tourists were advised by the tour-operators to postpone their trip by a few days till the rush weaned away. Not only this, he said, "Home Tourism‚Äù has picked up in a big way, resulting in new avenues of livelihood for the local populace, including the youth.


    The Majuli island in Assam, Dr Jitendra Singh informed, is being developed as a World Heritage tourist resort and several scenic spots in Arunachal Pradesh have suddenly come into focus because now there is a rail link with Arunachal Pradesh and soon an Airport will also come up at Itanagar.


    The most impartial and objective evidence testifying the upsurge in tourist inflow, Dr Jitendra Singh said, can be obtained from the fact that private tour-operators from far flung States of South India are also now planning Vacation itineraries for Northeast.


    Dr Jitendra Singh said the Northeast outreach by the Ministry of DoNER has touched chord with the youth across the country.
