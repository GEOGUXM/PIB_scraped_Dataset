      Posted On: 18 OCT 2018 4:34PM by PIB Delhi


    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind greeted people on the occasion of Durga Puja, Dussehra and Vijayadashmi.


    In his message, the President said â€œOn the auspicious occasion of Durga Puja and Vijayadashmi, I convey Shubho Bijoya as well as Dussehra greetings and best wishes to all my fellow citizens in India and abroad.


    Durga Puja and Vijayadashmi symbolise the victory of truth and righteousness over evil. This is a day to share our happiness with the less-fortunate, the lonely and those in pain. It is also an opportunity to cherish the spirit of unity and bonds of fraternity among our people.


    Let us celebrate Goddess Durga as the epitome of Shakti. May she guide us to work to empower women in society, especially girl-children. And let us celebrate Lord Rama as a reflection of the moral and eternal values that have guided our way of life since time immemorial."
