    The Change of Guard Ceremony on Sundays, which was discontinued earlier due to extreme weather conditions, will recommence from October 7, 2018. The timing of the Ceremony will be from 1730 hrs to 1810 hrs (October 7, 2018 to November 14, 2018) and from 1630 hrs to 1710 hrs (November 15, 2018 to March 14, 2019).


    The Ceremony will also continue to take place on every Saturday at its original timings, i.e., from 1000 hrs to 1040 hrs (November 15 to March 14) and from 0800 hrs to 0840 hrs (March 15 to November 14).


    The Change of Guard is a military tradition taken forward by the President’s Bodyguards (PBG) and the Army Guard. The 40 minute ceremony commences with the PBG troops advancing from behind the Jaipur column to the tune of ‘Maa Tujhe Salaam’, played by the Army Brass Band. The Army Guard contingent then marches in and the new guard replaces the old guard. The day's ceremony ends with an equestrian display by the PBG before they ride away towards Rashtrapati Bhavan, and with the National Anthem.


    A request to witness the Change of Guard Ceremony can be made online through a link on the website https://rb.nic.in/rbvisit/rbvisit_cog.aspx . However, a person with valid government issued photo ID card would be allowed to witness the Ceremony subject to availability of seats . Entry is through Gate No. 2 or 37 of Rashtrapati Bhavan.
