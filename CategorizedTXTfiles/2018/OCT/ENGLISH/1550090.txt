      Posted On: 20 OCT 2018 5:59PM by PIB Delhi


    The National Police Memorial (NPM) will be dedicated to the nation by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi tomorrow in recognition of the supreme sacrifice made by police personnel since independence.


    October 21 is observed as the Police Commemoration Day every year in memory of the policemen killed at Hot Springs in Ladakh by Chinese troops on this date in 1959.


    The memorial has been erected on 6.12 acres of land in Chanakyapuri, at the northern end of Shanti Path.


    This Police Memorial represents all State/UT Police Forces and Central Police Organizations of the country.


    Since 1947, 34,844 police personnel have been martyred, with 424 losing their lives this year. Many of these brave lives were lost in the fight against terrorism (referred to as militancy and insurgency in some theatres) in various geographical regions such as Kashmir, Punjab, Assam, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and LWE-affected regions of the country.


    Further, a large number of police lives were lost in prevention of crime and in maintenance of law and order.


    The central sculpture of the NPM is a 30 feet monolith made of a single piece of granite, weighing 238 tonnes. Its weight and colour symbolise the gravitas and solemnity of the supreme sacrifice. A 60 foot long river at the base of the sculpture reflects the continuous self-service of the policeman and woman, to maintain peace and public order.


    The Wall of Valour has the names of all 34,844 martyrs engraved on granite.


    A Police Museum will also be dedicated to the nation. It contains artefacts and points of time that shaped the history of the Indian police.
