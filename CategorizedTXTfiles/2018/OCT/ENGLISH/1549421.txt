    The technological intervention that has made the nomination process accessible to the people at large and the emphasis of the Government to confer Padma Awards upon unsung heroes, who are doing selfless service to the nation, have resulted in a transformation.


    The online nomination process for the Padma Awards to be announced on the occasion of Republic Day, 2019 commenced on 1st May 2018 and the last date for submission of nominations was September 15, 2018.


    Nominations were invited from Central Ministries/Departments, States/UT Governments, Bharat Ratna and Padma Vibhushan awardees, Institutes of Excellence as also from several other sources to enable broad based consideration. All citizens can make nominations/recommendation including self-nomination.
