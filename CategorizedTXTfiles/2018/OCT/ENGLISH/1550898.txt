    Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA) reviewed the price and availability situation of Onion in Delhi in a High Level meeting chaired by the Secretary, DoCA Shri Avinash K. Srivastava with all the concerned stakeholders today. It was observed that while the wholesale prices of Onions had peaked during the middle of the month of October, they have now moderated marginally. To sustain the momentum, a decision was taken to further increase daily supply for Delhi from the existing buffer created under Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF).


    Measures to reduce gap in the prices at wholesale and retail levels in Delhi were also discussed in the meeting. In this context, Delhi government was advised to undertake supply of onions as was done during the previous high price year i.e. 2015 through its PDS outlets . Prices in Delhi would be monitored closely and Delhi government would consider intervening in the market in case prices start hardening. Safal/Mother Dairy was also directed to increase supply of Onion through its retail outlets and larger quantities of Onion would be made available to them from the buffer under PSF.


    It was indicated by Horticulture division (DAC&FW) that sown area under the Kharif Onion Crop has increased by 37 percent as compared to 2017 and informed that the supply position of Onions in the market has improved as harvesting has begun in Rajasthan, Sholapur in Maharashtra, Hubli in Karnataka and Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh. This will improve availability in consuming areas, thereby, helping moderate prices in the coming days.
