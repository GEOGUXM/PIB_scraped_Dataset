    The Severe Cyclonic Storm ‘TITLI’ over westcentral Bay of Bengal moved northwards with a speed of about 14 kmph during past 06 hours, and lay centered at 0830 hrs IST of today, the 10th October 2018 over Westcentral Bay of Bengal near latitude 16.5°N and longitude 85.8°E, about 320 km south-southeast of Gopalpur (Odisha) and 270 km southeast of Kalingapatnam (Andhra Pradesh). It is very likely to intensify further into a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm.


    It is very likely to move north-northwestwards and cross Odisha & adjoining north Andhra Pradesh coasts between Gopalpur & Kalingapatnam around morning of 11th October. Thereafter, it is very likely to re-curve northeastwards, move towards Gangetic West Bengal across Odisha and weaken gradually.
