    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind has issued the following message to the nation on the eve of Gandhi Jayanti.


    In his message the President has said, “Gandhi Jayanti is an occasion for all of us to rededicate ourselves to the values espoused by the Father of the Nation - peace, fraternity, harmony and inclusive national development. Mahatma Gandhi’s values and his life itself had a universal appeal, making him an ideal not just for Indians but for the entire world. This year is even more special since it marks the beginning of the celebration of 150 years of the Gandhiji’s birth.


    Gandhiji’s leadership inspired millions to participate in the struggle for the independence of our nation and in fact our subcontinent. The dawn of a free India meant that Indians could build the destiny of their nation and live a life of respect and honour. Gandhiji continues to be our guiding light as we seek to completely eradicate poverty and achieve rapid social and economic progress.


    It is only befitting that the people and Government of India would celebrate Gandhi Jayanti this year with welfare programmes pertinent to the life and work of Mahatma Gandhi. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is a true tribute to Gandhiji, who espoused cleanliness as an essential element of healthy living.


    This Gandhi Jayanti let us all resolve to make our homes, residential areas, cities, villages and our country clean-and to spread the message of total sanitation. Mahatma Gandhiji message remains relevant for all Indians – and indeed for all humanity”.
