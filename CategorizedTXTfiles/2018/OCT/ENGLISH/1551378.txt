    The Ministry of Information & Broadcasting has received letter from Shri Anupam Kher, Chairperson, Film & Television Institute of India, Pune in which Shri Kher has intimated his upcoming international shooting commitments. Due to those commitments, Shri Kher has informed that he will not be present in the country for nearly nine months between 2018-19. He feels that it will not be possible for him to discharge his responsibilities as Chairperson, FTII due to his commitments.


    Acknowledging Shri Kherâ€™s pre-occupations and requirement of time that the post demands, the Ministry has accepted his resignation. Information & Broadcasting Minister, Col Rajyavardhan Rathore thanked Shri Anupam Kher for steering FTII with such acumen and empathy. His stature, erudition and goodwill among the film fraternity contributed to the standing of the Institute.


    The Minister wished Shri Anupam Kher the best in all his future endeavours and expressed delight about him representing India as a Cultural Ambassador in the international domain. The Ministry will continue to rely on his experience and advice Shri Rathore added.
