      Posted On: 22 OCT 2018 5:52PM by PIB Delhi


    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, inaugurated the Vishwashanti Ahimsa Sammelan at Mangi Tungi, Nasik, Maharashtra today (October 22, 2018). The event is being organised by the Bhagwan Shri Rishabhdev 108 Feet Vishalkai Digambar Jain Murti Nirman Committee.


    Speaking on the occasion, the President said that in the Jain tradition, the principle of ‘Ahimsa Paramodharma’ is distinguished for human welfare and compassion - not just for the absence of physical violence. The President said that Bhagwan Mahavir gave special importance to ‘Apirigraha’ - not taking what is more than essential to live. Humankind is exploiting nature indiscriminately. Ruthless consumption and accumulation of resources is increasing. Due to this, phenomena like climate change are emerging as challenges. Following the Jain tradition shows us a way out.
