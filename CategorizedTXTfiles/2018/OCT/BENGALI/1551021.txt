    The closing ceremony of the 150th birth anniversary celebration of Sister Nivedita was held today in the city by Sister Nivedita Mission Trust. The Union Minister of Textiles Smt Smriti Zubin Irani while addressing the gathering said it is very rare that a person of science is also a person of faith, as she gave the instance of Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose, who was a very good friend of Sister Nivedita. She reiterated that debate and deliberation became the fulcrum of the relationship for conversation between Swmi Vivekanada and Sister Nivedita.


    Smt Irani pointed out that Sister Niveditaâ€™s preachings have given boost to the progress of

    science and technology in India. The Minister urged upon the young generation to continue the mission of scientific researches as well as inventions to make India strong in this sphere.
    According to the Minister, Sister Nivedita showed us that the role of spiritual guide can be taken only by a woman in the family. Even Swami Vivekananda in tune with Sister Nivedita harped on the fact that awakening of women is the foundation of Indian strength, she said. In this context, she mentioned what Swami Vivekananda once said; women may work out their own destiny much better than men can build for them. The Minister added that women are the strength of the society who help to keep the balance.
