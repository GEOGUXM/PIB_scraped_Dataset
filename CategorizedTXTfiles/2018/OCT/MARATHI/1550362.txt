    The Government serves not only those citizens who have voted but also those who did not vote; that is the core of policy-making, Union Minister for Textiles, Smt. Smriti Zubin Irani said in Mumbai today. She was speaking at the Young Thinkers’ Conference, organized by British Deputy High Commission, Mumbai in association with ORF (Observer Research Foundation).


    The Minister said that the Government has implemented the Food Security Act successfully in all states and that 34 million tons of food grain has been made available to the people.


    The Minister also said that due to PM Ujjwala Yojana, a clean cooking fuel is now available and deforestation has decreased as 11 crore people have been taken away from the activity of deforestation.


    She said that the government has, for the first time, leveraged technology to ensure people's participation in policy-making, through the citizen engagement platform, MyGov.
