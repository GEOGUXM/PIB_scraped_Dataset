    The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation had commissioned “Swachh Survekshan Grameen-2018” (SSG 2018) through an independent survey agency to develop ranking of all districts of India on the basis of quantitative and qualitative sanitation (Swachhata) parameters. This ranking was done based on a comprehensive set of parameters including surveys of public places like schools, Anganwadis, PHCs, Haat/ Bazaars, Panchayat and citizen’s perception of Swachhata and their recommendations for improvement of the program and data from the SBM-G IMIS.


    As part of Swachh SurvekshanGrameen, 6786 villages in 685 Districts across India were covered. 27,963 public places namely schools, anganwadis, public health centres, haat/ bazaars/religious places in these 6786 villages were visited by an independent agency for survey. Around 182,531 citizens were interviewed for their feedback in villages on SBM-G related issues. Also, citizens were mobilised to provide feedback on sanitation relation related issues online using an application developed for the purpose. The collection of data from Direct Observation were based on physical observation of the sanitation status in public places by the survey agency. The survey agency used maps and simple handheld device/recording formats to record their observations and findings along with Photographs/videos, wherever necessary.


    Feedback from people were obtained using Community wide open meetings,Personal Interviews and Focussed Group Discussions. FGDs were conducted in each village. More than 1.5 crore people participated in the SSG 2018 and provided their feedback.


    The SSG 2018 turned out to be massive mass mobilisation exercise with communities in each village undertaking special drives to improve the general cleanliness in their villages. Gram Panchayats invested funds from their local area development fund to augment the sanitation situation in public places.
