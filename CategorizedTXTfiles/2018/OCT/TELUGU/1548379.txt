    Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs) at Nalgonda situated at Head Post Office, Nalgonda has been successfully shifted to online mode. Since its inauguration in March, 2018 POPSK, Nalgonda was running in “Camp Mode” where the applicants had to wait for 7-10 days before their files could be fully processed. . To avoid such delay, the POPSK, Nalgonda will be functioning in PSP online mode with effect from 04-10-2018. Processing of all applications submitted at POPSKs will be completed on the same day itself on par with other Passport Seva Kendras (PSKs) in the state.


    Passport applicants from Nalgonda and surrounding areas are requested to note the change and make best use of the facility.
