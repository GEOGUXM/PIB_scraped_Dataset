    Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh has been approached by "Save Sharda Committee, Kashmir", a registered organization, for facilitating the resumption of annual Sharda Peeth Yatra to Sharda in district Muzaffarabad in Pak-occupied Jammu & Kashmir (PoJK). The Yatra has remained suspended since 1948.


    A delegation led by Shri Ravinder Pandita held a meeting with the Minister here today and discussed various aspects and the sanctity of the Yatra. In a written representation, they stated that the Yatra used to be undertaken annually in the month of August i.e. Badaun on Ashtami of Shukla Paksh and would take the route via Kupwara in Kashmir to the Peeth in Muzafarrabad, PoJK. The Yatra was largely organized by the Dogra rulers in the pre-Independence era, but has remained suspended after 1948.


    Dr Jitendra Singh informed the delegation that he is aware of the issue and has also held a series of meetings in this regard.
