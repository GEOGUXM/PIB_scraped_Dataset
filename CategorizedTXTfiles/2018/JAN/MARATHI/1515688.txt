    Ministry of Minority Affairs has organised an exhibition titled “Hunar Haat” with the theme of ‘Craft Aur Cuisine Ka Sangam’ from 4 th to 10 th January, 2018 at the Islam Gymkhana, Marine Lines, Mumbai. It was inaugurated by Shri Vinod Tawde, Minority Development & waqf, Maharashtra and Shri Amesing Luikham, Secretary, Ministry of Minority Affairs, Government of India today.


    Highlights of Hunar Haat


     The exhibition is being organised through National Minorities Development & Finance Corporation (NMDFC) under USTTAD (Upgrading the Skills & Training in Traditional Arts/Crafts for Development) scheme of Ministry of Minority Affairs.


     The USTTAD Scheme aims at preserving & promoting the rich heritage of the traditional arts & crafts of the Minority communities. These crafts have gradually lost their employability in the light of globalisation & competitive market. This has demotivated the younger generation including the wards of Master Craft-persons to look for different avenues for livelihood. This Ministry is trying to preserve such art forms through inputs such as better marketing linkage, new designs, better packaging, training & credit linkage.


     Organizing Hunar Haat is part of the initiative of Ministry of Minority Affairs to provide marketing linkages. As part of the USTTAD scheme, the Ministry has already organised four exhibitions successfully during the last two years. Starting with Hunar Haat at IITF, 2016 followed by Craft Aur Cuisine Ka Sangam at Baba Kharak Singh Marg in February 2017, Crafts & Cuisine Ka Sangam at Puducherry during September, 2017 and recently Hunar Haat IITF during November, 2017.
