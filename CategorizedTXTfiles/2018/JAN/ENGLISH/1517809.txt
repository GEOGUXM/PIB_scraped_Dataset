    In the last few days, I have seen news and videos in which there have been accidents of youth taking selfies or showing stunts near railway tracks. It is very disheartening to know about these accidents. You all are the future of the country and my appeal is to avoid putting your life at risk and stay alert around the railway tracks. Follow the rules & signs and pay attention while approaching rail crossings.
