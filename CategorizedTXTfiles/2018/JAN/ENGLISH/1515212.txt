      External Threat to Security
      Posted On: 03 JAN 2018 3:44PM by PIB Delhi


    Threats to the security of the country through the sea route are assessed at regular intervals. Monitoring, review and assessment of the coastal security construct is an ongoing process and is undertaken on a periodic basis. National Committee on Strengthening Maritime and Coastal Security (NCSMCS) monitors the progress in respect of coastal security initiatives, any shortfall encountered, and decides on measures to plug the gaps. A coastal security ring all along our coast is provided by Marine Police, Indian Coast Guard and Indian Navy. Other measures include improving surveillance mechanism, enhanced patrolling and joint operational exercises conducted on regular basis among Indian Navy, Indian Coast Guard, Marine Police, Customs and others. Installation of radars covering the countryâ€™s entire coastline and islands is also an essential part of this process.
