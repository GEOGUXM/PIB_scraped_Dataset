    As per International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), India presently ranks third in number of reactors under construction after China and Russian Federation (based on the placement of first pour of concrete) and seventh in number of reactors in operation.


    Some of the suppliers / contractors of Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) had reported financial difficulties, as a result of which there was a delay in supplies of equipment and execution of Kakrapar Atomic Power Project (KAPP) 3&4 (2X700 MW) and Rajasthan Atomic Power Project (RAPP) 7&8 (2X700 MW) projects. The issue of financial difficulty of vendors / contractors was appropriately addressed by NPCIL.


    There are presently 59 reactors under construction in 17 countries with an aggregate capacity of 60,366 MW in the world as reported by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The decisions on addition of nuclear power capacity are country specific and depend on factors like the countryâ€™s nuclear and energy policies, requirements, availability of various energy options, market conditions etc.


    This was stated by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.
