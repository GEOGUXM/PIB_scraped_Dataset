    *However, connectivity has been achieved in 23 out of these 34 roads.


    There are delays in execution of some of the 61 ICBRs entrusted to BRO mainly due to the following reasons:-

      * Delay in Forest/Wildlife clearance
      * Hard rock stretches.
      * Limited working season.
      * Difficulties in availability of construction material.
      * Delay in land acquisition.
      * Damages due to natural disasters.

    The Government has taken following measures to expedite the construction of border roads:-


      * States of Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, J&K, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand have constituted the Empowered Committee to resolve the issues pertaining to BRO.

      * Outsourcing has been allowed to augment the capacity of BRO.
      * Enhanced financial and administrative powers have been given to the executives of BRO.
