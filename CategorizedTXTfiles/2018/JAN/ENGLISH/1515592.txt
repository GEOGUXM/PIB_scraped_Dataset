      Shortage of Nuclear Fuel
      Posted On: 04 JAN 2018 8:39PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government has provided fuel from both indigenous and imported sources in required quantities for operation of nuclear power reactors at their rated power.


    As per the vision plan prepared, in order to fulfil the requirement of Uranium to fuel nuclear power plants, Department of Atomic Energy will achieve nearly ten-fold rise in uranium production in next 15 years (by 2031-2032). The uranium mining projects have been planned in three phases. On completion of the projects in first phase, it is expected to produce 3.5 times of existing uranium production by the 12th year. On completion of the projects in second phase, uranium production is expected to achieve seven times of existing production. With the completion of phase three projects uranium production of the country is expected to record ten-fold increase by 2031-32.


    The above is subject to obtaining all statutory clearances and external constraints.


    Consequent upon the Civil Nuclear cooperation, DAE has been importing Uranium to meet the fuel requirements of IAEA Safeguarded Nuclear Power Plants. The details of quantities of Uranium imported so far since the year 2009 and the anticipated supplies during the year 2017-18 is as follows:-
