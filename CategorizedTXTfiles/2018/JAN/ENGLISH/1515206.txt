      Posted On: 03 JAN 2018 3:40PM by PIB Delhi


    In view of the recent stampede at Elphinstone Road Railway Station at Mumbai, there was an urgent need to address enhancement of infrastructure in terms of construction of additional Foot Over Bridges at selected railway stations in Mumbai. Accordingly, under the provisions of ‘Instructions on Aid to the Civil Authorities by the Armed Forces, 1970’, Indian Army Engineers have been entrusted with construction of three foot-over-bridges at Elphinstone Road Railway Station, Curry Road Railway Station and Ambivili Railway Station.


    The cost of the assistance provided by the Army is recoverable from the concerned Civil Authority, in terms of the provisions of ‘Instructions on Aid to the Civil Authorities by the Armed Forces, 1970’.


    This information was given by Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri Hariom Singh Rathore and Dr. Manoj Rajoria in Lok Sabha today.
