      Posted On: 02 JAN 2018 5:05PM by PIB Delhi


    As per Article 51A (a) of the Constitution of India, it shall be the duty of every citizen of India to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and the National Anthem. However, there is no reference in the Constitution of India for a separate flag for a State.


    The Government of Karnataka has not made available any details about the setting up of Committee in this regard.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.
