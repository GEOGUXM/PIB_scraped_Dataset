    The Central Public Works Department, Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs has this year installed the new Dynamic Façade lighting system at monumental heritage buildings of international importance i.e. Rashtrapati Bhawan, North Block & South Block.

New lighting system has computerized control having unified power and data cable for easy installation and maintenance with automation in selection of colour combination scheme using opti-bin technology, selection of timing, facility of dimming, switching on/off facility, individual/combined control of light fittings etc. through Ethernet based controller. This lighting system has got features to produce multi-colour combinations. The colour combination on domes, chattries, logia columns, facade of main buildings of Rashtrapati Bhawan, North Block and South Block have enhanced the architectural features of these buildings. This system is energy efficient as well as cost effective and there is value addition by putting this system on these buildings.
