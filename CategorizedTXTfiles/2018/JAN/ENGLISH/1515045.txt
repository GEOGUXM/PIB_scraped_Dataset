      Posted On: 02 JAN 2018 5:46PM by PIB Delhi


    Post 26/11, the Government has taken several initiatives to strengthen coastal security. A Coastal security mechanism in the form of a three-tiered cover comprising Indian Navy (IN), Indian Coast Guard (ICG), and State Marine Police with demarcated areas of responsibility has been put in place. The Indian Navy coordinates deployment of surface and air assets with the ICG for conduct of the patrols / surveillance. State wise Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for coordination among several agencies on coastal security issues have also been instituted to handle various types of situations. In addition to patrolling by surface and air assets, electronic surveillance of the maritime zones is undertaken using chain of coastal / offshore radars, National Automatic Identification System (NAIS) chain and Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) System. In addition, other stakeholders also contribute to improving maritime surveillance and information to prevent possible infiltrations from the sea route. Measures relating to coastal security are undertaken by the Centre as well as by coastal States.
