    The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is in process of formulation of a Scheme for Protection, Care and Rehabilitation of Beggars.


    Ministry of Women and Child Development has informed that the Ministry is implementing a centrally sponsored Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS) (now “Child Protection Services”) for children in need of care and protection (CNCP). CNCP are defined under section 2(14) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act) respectively. As per Section 2(14)(ii) of JJ Act, a child who is found working in contravention of labour laws for the time being in force or is found begging, or living on the street is included as a “child in need of care and protection”. The primary responsibility in execution of the JJ Act lies with the State Governments/UTs. Under ICPS, financial assistance is provided to the State Governments/UT Administrations for, inter-alia, undertaking a situational analysis of children in difficult circumstances, for setting up and maintenance of various types of Chid Care Institutions (CCIs). The scheme, provides institutional care through CCIs. As a rehabilitative measures in these CCIs, children are provided age appropriate education either within the institution or outside in a formal education system through convergence with other schemes and programs of the Government or Civil Society. The Scheme also provides for family based non-institutional care through adoption, sponsorship and foster-care.
