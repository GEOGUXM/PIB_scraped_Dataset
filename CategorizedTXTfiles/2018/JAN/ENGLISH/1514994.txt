      Decline in Ground Water Level
      Posted On: 02 JAN 2018 4:30PM by PIB Delhi


      Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) carries out ground water monitoring, four times a year, on regional scale through a network of observation wells in the Country. Comparison and analysis of Pre-monsoon (2017) water level data collected by CGWB with the decadal average (2007-2016) indicates decline in ground water level in about 61% of the wells. Details are given at Annexure.


      Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management including conservation and artificial recharge to ground water is primarily Statesâ€™ responsibility.


      MoWR, RD & GR has circulated a Model Bill to all the States/UTs to enable them to enact suitable ground water legislation for its regulation and development which includes provision of rain water harvesting. So far, 15 States/UTs have adopted and implemented the ground water legislation on the lines of Model bill.


      CGWA has issued advisories to States and UTs to take measures to promote/adopt artificial recharge to ground water/rainwater harvesting. 30 States/UTs have made rainwater harvesting mandatory by enacting laws or by formulating rules & regulations or by including provisions in building bye-laws or through suitable Government Orders.


      Besides, other steps taken by the Central Government for conservation of ground water are available at the following URL http://mowr.gov.in/writereaddata/GW_Depletion.pdf
