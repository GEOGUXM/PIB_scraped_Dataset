    The 198 th Report of the Law Commission of India titled “Witness Identity Protection & Witness Protection Programme” was circulated to State Governments/UTs for their views. The views of the State Governments/UTs were not unanimous. The matter was, therefore, referred to Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) for examining the same with reference to the observations of the States and feasibility of an implementable Witness Identity Protection and Witness Protection Programme, so as to enable Government to take a considered view. The report of BPR&D has been recently received and its recommendations are now under examination in the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.
