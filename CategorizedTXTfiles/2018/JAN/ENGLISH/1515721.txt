      Export of AYUSH Products
      Posted On: 05 JAN 2018 6:26PM by PIB Delhi


    The export of Ayurvedic products takes place under the Indian Trade Classification based on Harmonized System of Coding (ITCHS) through two HS codes-30039011 for medicants and 30049011 for medicaments. As such individual Ayurvedic products are not given separate HS codes to track the top Ayurvedic drugs being exported. And it is also a fact that the nomenclature of Ayurvedic products as drugs is prevailing in India and in some other countries where Ayurveda is recognized as a system of medicine. Export of above two categories of Ayurvedic products under the two ITCHS codes during the financial year 2016-17 is estimated to be to the tune of USD 243 million as per information provided by the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence & Statistics (DGCIS), Department of Commerce. Most of the Ayurvedic products are suitably modified for their intended use in the international market in accordance with the importing countryâ€™s classification and acceptance and are exported as nutraceuticals, health supplements and dietary supplements.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) for AYUSH, Shri Shripad Yesso Naik in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
