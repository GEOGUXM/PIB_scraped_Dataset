      Posted On: 03 JAN 2018 5:12PM by PIB Delhi


    As per available records more than 10000 NGOs have not filed their annual returns for six financial years (2010-11 to 2015-16). The year wise detail is available at fcraonline.nic.in under the ‘Information Bank’.


    There are sufficient penal provisions under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 to deal with failure in filing returns.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question in the Rajya Sabha today.
