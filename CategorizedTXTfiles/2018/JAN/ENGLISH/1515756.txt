    Participants of the Jagriti Yatra called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (January 5, 2018). The Jagriti Yatra is a 15-day long national train journey that covers 8,000 km across the length and breadth of the country. It aims to create awareness and encourage nation building though building enterprise.


    Speaking on the occasion, the President appreciated the organisers of Jagriti Yatra for linking self-employment opportunities available in our country with the talent of our youth. He said that there are immense possibilities for our youth. As such, an environment should be created for young people to generate employment opportunities instead of just looking for jobs. There is a need to bring a change in mindsets of people, and the Jagriti Yatra is making a commendable effort in this direction.
