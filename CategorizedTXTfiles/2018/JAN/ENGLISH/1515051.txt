      Overseas Military Base of China at Djibouti
      Posted On: 02 JAN 2018 5:48PM by PIB Delhi


    The Chinese Overseas Base at Djibouti was operationalized in August 2017 to provide Operational Turn Around (OTR) facilities for ships on anti-piracy operations. At present, there is no information to suggest that China is exercising freedom of navigation operations in IOR. China largely depends on the oil imports transiting through the Indian Ocean. It would be in Chinaâ€™s interest that shipping lanes and traffic in the Indian Ocean remain secure. The Indian Navy maintains regular presence and surveillance in the maritime areas of interest. Since August 2017, Indian Navy deployments in the IOR have been further structured under the Mission Based Deployment (MBD) concept.
