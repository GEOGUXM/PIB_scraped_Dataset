    NCOF launched waste decomposer culture in 2015 which is proving as miracle all over the country. It is used for quick composting from organic waste, soil health improvement and as plant protection agent. It is a consortium of micro organism extracted from desi cow dung. As on date waste decomposer is solid in a bottle of 30 gms costing Rs. 20/- per bottle directly through NCOF and RCOF to 1 lakh farmers. The waste decomposer is also validated by ICAR.


    How to prepare waste decomposer?

      * Take 2 kg jiggery and mixed it in a plastic drum containing 200 liters water.
      * Now take 1 bottle of waste decomposer and pour all its contents in a plastic drum containing jiggery drum.
      * Mix it properly with a wooden stick for uniform distribution of waste decomposer in a drum.
      * Cover the drum with a paper or cardboard and stir it every day once or twice.
      * After 5 days the solution of drum turns creamy.

    Note 1 : Farmers could prepare the waste decomposer solution again and again from the above formed solution. For this, 20 liter of waste decomposer solution is added to a drum with 2 kg of jiggery and 20 liter water added.


    Note 2 : Farmers can prepare continuously this solution from this waste decomposer for lifetime.
