      Posted On: 03 JAN 2018 4:35PM by PIB Delhi


    Indian Railways has tested the bio-diesel of different feed stock (Jatropha, Mahua, pongamia, waste cotton seed, Fish Oil, Soyabeen oil, Palm stearin etc.) in the different blending ratio such as B5, B10, B20, B50 and B 100 on its 16 cylinder ALCo and EMD engine test beds. The power performance of engine has been found satisfactory without any adverse impact on engine working. Besides, bio-diesel is found to reduce certain emission parameters which would have otherwise caused pollution in environment.


    Key Advantages of Bio-Diesel:


    (i) Renewable Energy source


    (ii) Derived from Vegetable oil


    (iii) Non-toxic & Biodegradable


    (iv) Contains no sulphur that causes acid rain


    (v) Higher Cetane number, better ignition quality


    (vi) Used directly in unmodified Diesel engines, neat or blended in any ratio with HSD


    (vii) Higher Lubricity â€“ Can prolong engine life


    (viii) Flashpoint higher than HSD-safer to store & transport


    (ix) Environment friendly-less emissions


    (x) Has rural employment potential.


    Bio-Diesel is environment friendly. It substantially reduces unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulate matter in exhaust fumes. Sulphur dioxide emissions are also eliminated.


    This Press Release is based on the information given by the Minister of State for Railways Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha on 03.01.2018 (Wednesday).
