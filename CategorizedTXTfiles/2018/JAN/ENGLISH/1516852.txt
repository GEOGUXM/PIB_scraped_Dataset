    Union Minister of Mines Shri Narendra Singh Tomar today met mining companies from Odisha to review the production of iron ore, subsequent to the closure of 6 mines in Odisha. It was noted that some miners still have a headroom to increase production within their permissible Environment clearance and other limits. The Minister requested the miners to follow the Honâ€™ble Supreme Court orders on mining and endeavour to increase their production to the maximum possible within their permissible ceilings. Though the production in January is expected to be lower, the operating miners assured that they shall step up production so that steel industry remains fully supplied. The Minister exhorted the miners to increase production and assured them that the Ministry will facilitate in enhancing production and miners were free to approach the Ministry with specific problems which they may encounter.
