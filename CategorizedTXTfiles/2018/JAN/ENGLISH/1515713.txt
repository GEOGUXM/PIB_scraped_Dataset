    Along with focused efforts to improve operational efficiency of ports and increase traffic at ports, Ministry of Shipping is making steady strides towards utilizing the country’s river system & inland waterways as economically viable and environment friendly mode of transport.


    Opening a new world for business & employment opportunities in North-East through inland waterways, recently, Shri Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister of Shipping, Road Transport & Highways, Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation flagged off regular cargo movement on Brahmaputra (NW2) from Pandu Port to Dhubri in Assam. Focused efforts are been made to connect North-East region to Kolkata, Haldia, Mongla and Chittagong ports, provide efficient logistics in North-East region and set up Ro-Ro off services across river banks


    The Ministry of Shipping, under the leadership of Shri Gadkari is all geared up to create an enabling environment for growth of seaplane led air connectivity and leverage water bodies in country. After witnessing the Seaplane trial in Mumbai recently, the Minister has requested the Ministry of Civil Aviation to prepare a regulatory framework for seaplanes, keeping in mind all safety aspects.


    The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi recently has given its approval for implementation of the Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) for capacity augmentation of navigation on National Waterway-1 (NW-1). The Rs 5,369 Crore project, which is expected to be completed by March 2023, will bring down the logistic cost in the country and lead to major infrastructure development like multi-modal and inter-modal terminals, roll on-roll off (Ro-Ro) facilities, ferry services, and navigation aids. The JMVP will create an alternative mode of transport that will be "environment friendly and cost effective" and will give boost to economy & trade, generate huge business & employment opportunities thus converting Ganga into the economic lifeline of people in states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand & West Bengal.
