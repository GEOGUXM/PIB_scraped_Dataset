      Paris Agreement on Climate Change
      Posted On: 05 JAN 2018 9:24PM by PIB Delhi


    “United States of America (USA) is the second largest Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emitter presently. However, if cumulative historical emission is considered, USA would be largest GHG emitter. So, its withdrawal will affect control of cumulative global GHG emissions. It will also affect the availability of international funds for climate change, as USA was a contributor to climate finance.


    There is no proposal to rework the modalities of Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement was adopted under United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2015. It has been ratified by 172 Parties and only USA has submitted a written communication to UN Secretary-General stating its intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. All other countries have indicated their continued support for it through the decision, ‘Fiji Momentum for Implementation’ adopted during 23 rd Conference of Parties (COP-23) held in November 2017, which u nderscored the importance of keeping the momentum and continuing to uphold thespirit and vision of the Paris Agreement.


    A preliminary estimate suggests that at least US $2.5 trillion (at 2014-15 prices) will be required for meeting India's climate change actions between 2015 and 2030, which is expected to evolve over time. The estimate covers both the domestic resources and the international climate finance . The foreign aid India is expected to receive under the Paris Agreement is subject to quantum of available international climate finance in the post-2020 period, which is a matter under negotiations currently.”


    This information was given by Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Mahesh Sharma, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
