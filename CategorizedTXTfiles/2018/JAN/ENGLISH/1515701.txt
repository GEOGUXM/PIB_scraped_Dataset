      Labour Charges in FCI
      Posted On: 05 JAN 2018 5:56PM by PIB Delhi


    Some instances of high handling of bags by labourers during rake loading, unloading and procurement operations process were noticed in FCI. Accordingly, the matter was investigated and disciplinary action has been taken against concerned erring officials.


    Further, payment of high incentives was also noticed in some of the FCI depots. This was due to incentives norms and was taking place especially during loading and unloading of rakes when the volume of operation increases multifold. Consequently labourers have had to handle more bags than the norm prevalent at that time. The rationalization of labour in pursuant to exemption notification dated 06.07.2016 and revision of incentives norms has considerably reduced incidence of high incentives.


    Further, preventive measures like installation of CCTV cameras, biometric attendance have been put in place to avoid possible use of any proxy labour.


    The total payment towards labour charges made by FCI during last three years was as under:


    (Rs. in crore)
