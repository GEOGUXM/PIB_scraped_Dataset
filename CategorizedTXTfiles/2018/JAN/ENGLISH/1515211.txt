    HAL produced fighter / trainer / transport aircraft, helicopter and associated systems & sub-systems do not fall under the category of weapons / arms / ammunition.


    In order to fast track the production of LCA from existing 8 aircraft to 16 aircraft per annum Government of India has approved an investment of Rs.1,381.04 Crores, against which HAL has already started the development activities. Su-30 MKI programme is on the verge of completion; hence, there is no plan to augment the production facilities for this platform.


    The following steps have been taken by HAL to ensure timely and enhanced production of LCA aircraft.


    • Establishment of second line for structural and equipping activities at Aircraft Division, HAL.


    • Reduction in manufacturing cycle time through improved supply chain management, learning and augmentation of manpower.


    • Established contracts for outsourcing of major modules namely Front fuselage, Centre fuselage, Rear fuselage, Wing and various sub-assemblies to private partners.
