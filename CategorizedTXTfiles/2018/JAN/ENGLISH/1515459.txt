      Posted On: 04 JAN 2018 3:37PM by PIB Delhi


    The success of the first developmental flight of GSLV Mark III will enable indigenous launching up to 4 tonne class of communication satellites in the future.


    ISRO has been providing commercial launch services for earth observation satellites and small satellites onboard the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) through Antrix Corporation Limited since 1999. The successful launch of GSLV Mark III is a step ahead in building credibility in launching.


    ISRO has just completed one launch of GSLV-MK III. Next developmental launch is in first half of 2018. Some more launches of GSLV-MK III will be needed before GSLV MK III gets recognised internationally as a vehicle for transportation to space.


    This was stated by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply to question in the Rajya Sabha today.
