    Indian Space Programme has placed Astrosat, a multi-wavelength observatory in August 2015. It observes universe in optical, Ultraviolet, low and high energy X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum, whereas most other scientific satellites are capable of observing a narrow range of wavelength band.


    Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) is designed to orbit Mars. It is functioning well since its positioning in Mars orbit in September 24, 2014. The designed mission life of MOM was six months but has successfully completed more than three years and is expected to function further. All scientific payloads continue to perform well.


    This was stated by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply to question in the Rajya Sabha today.
