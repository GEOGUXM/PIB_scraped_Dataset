      The number of women employed in MSMEs, as per the survey mentioned above are 2,64,91,687. Out of them 2,41,425 women are employed in Delhi. The information on average monthly income being earned by women in the MSMEs was not collected during the survey. However, the information on emolument only for hired worker was collected during the aforesaid survey and the average annual emolument per hired worker is Rs. 86,390.


      The Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) implements various Schemes like the Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), Micro & Small Enterprises Cluster Development (MSE-CDP) and Scheme of Fund for Regeneration of Traditional Industries (SFURTI), which encourage creation of enterprises and also creation of infrastructure for MSMEs. MSMEs are predominantly labour intensive and aspects such as child care support, safety of women and support to women workers have to be taken care of by the employer as per law.
