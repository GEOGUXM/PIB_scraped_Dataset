      The National Highways Authority of India has provided toilet facilities at 192 toll plazas across the country, while the remaining 180 toll plazas will be covered by the end of March, 2019. Under the Government of Indiaâ€™s flagship programmes Swachh Bharat Mission, NHAI is providing separate ladies and gents toilets on both upside and down side of each of its 372 toll plazas, and also placing litterbins and hoardings carrying the Swachhta message along with message discouraging littering at these sites.


      NHAI has observed both the current Swachhta Pakhwada from 16 th -31 st January as well as the earlier one from 16-31 st July, 2017, and proposes to achieve the target of providing toilet facilities at every toll plaza during the final year of the Swachh Bharat Mission .
