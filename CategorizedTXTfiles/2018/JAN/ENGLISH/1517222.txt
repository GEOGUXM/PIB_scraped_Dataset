    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:


         1. Crude oil production by ONGC during December, 2017 was 1862.08 TMT which is 6.40% lower than the monthly target and 2.23% lower when compared with December, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-December, 2017 was 16848.70 TMT which is 2.78% lower than target for the period but 1.32% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production with respect to target are as under:

      * Delay in implementation of ‘Conversion of Sagar Samrat to MOPU’ & ‘Integrated Development of B 127 Cluster’
      * Production from NBP field in western offshore affected due to ESP related issues.
      * Increase in water cut in wells of Heera, Neelam and B-173 fields.
      * Frequent power shut down hampered artificial lift operations and caused unexpected well closure in Mehsana.

         1. Crude oil production by OIL during December, 2017 was 288.38 TMT which is 9.07% lower than monthly target but 2.78% higher than production in December, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-December, 2017 was 2548.42 TMT which is 9.41% lower than target for the period but 4.85% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * Less than planned contribution from old wells – Rise in water cut in wells and decline in total liquid production of wells of Greater Hapjan and Greater Chandmari Fields.

      * Less than planned contribution from work over wells

         1. Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during December, 2017 was 840.61 TMT which is 6.9% lower than the monthly target and 3.37% lower than December, 2016. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-December, 2017 was 7537.28 TMT which is 5.89% lower than target for the period and 5.62% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * RJ-ON-90/1 (CIL): Around 90 wells are closed either due to high water cut or require WOJ. Underperformance of reservoir in Bhagyam. Production affected in Dec’17 from Guda and Kaameshwari West due to non-availability of tankers.

      * Panna-Mukta (Shell): Lower production due to closure of re-perforation wells and loading of well PC-14H.
      * CY-ONN-2002/2 (ONGC): Full fledged production yet to be realized owing to non-grant of PML.

    Natural Gas

     1. Natural gas production during December, 2017 was 2751.36 MMSCM which is 7.42% lower than the target for the month but 0.53% higher when compared with December, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production during April-December, 2017 was 24687.55 MMSCM which is 5.5% lower than target for the period but 3.36% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II . Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of December, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April-December, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

    Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production


         1. Natural gas production by ONGC during December, 2017 was 2000.79 MMSCM which is 2.2% lower than the monthly target but 3.84% higher when compared with December, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC during April-December, 2017 was 17651.17 MMSCM which is 1.4% lower than the cumulative target but 7.5% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year. Reasons for shortfall in production during month are as under:


      * Delay in implementation of ‘Conversion of Sagar Samrat to MOPU’ & ‘Integrated Development of B 127 Cluster’.

      * Delay in commencement of production planned from one new sub-sea well in Eastern Offshore. Well has been completed and expected to be put on production during February, 2018.

         1. Natural gas production by OIL during December, 2017 was 236.97 MMSCM which is 6.04% lower than the monthly target and 3.86% lower than December, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-December, 2017 was 2196.98 MMSCM which is 2.77% lower than the cumulative target and 0.66% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * Reduction in production potential of few gas wells in Kathalguri and Zaloni area.

      * Unscheduled maintenance shutdown of plants of major cusmomers.

         1. Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during December, 2017 was 513.59 MMSCM which is 23.76% lower than the monthly target and 8.87% lower when compared with December, 2016. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-December, 2017 was 4839.40 MMSCM which is 18.83% lower than the cumulative target and 7.88% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * KG- OSN-2001/3 (GSPC): Underperformance of wells.

      * Sohagpur West (RIL): Underperformance of CBM wells.
      * Raniganj East (Essar): Few wells closed for planned maintenance and refrac jobs. Less offtake by buyer.
      * KG-DWN-98/3 (RIL): Closure of 3 wells in D1D3 field. Well A13 ceased on 15.12.2017 due to high water production.
      * Panna-Mukta (Shell): Lower production due to closure of re-perforation wells and loading of well PC-14H.

     1. Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)


    Refinery production during December, 2017 was 22129.13 TMT which is 2.43% higher than the target for the month and 3.21% higher when compared with December, 2016. Cumulative production during April-December, 2017 was 187963.86 TMT which is 3.28% higher than the target for the period and 2.21% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III . Company-wise production for the month of December, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April-December, 2017 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

    Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production


         1. CPSE Refineries’ production during December, 2017 was 12793.63 TMT which is 2.96% higher than the target for the month and 5.75% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-December, 2017 was 108059.43 TMT which is 4.72% higher than the target for the period and 5.16% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


      * IOCL, Barauni: Throughput lower than previous year due to M&I shutdown in Jul-Aug 2017 and HSD / naphtha containment.

      * IOCL, Haldia: Throughput lower due to M&I shutdown and VGO containment.
      * IOCL, Mathura: Throughput lower due to M&I shutdown.
      * IOCL, Paradip: Throughput lower due to VGO containment.
      * BPCL, Mumbai: Crude processing for Apr-Dec’17 is lower than Apr- Dec'16 due to planned outage of CDU3/ Hydrogen /Hydrocracker units for turnaround & revamp and annual turnaround of FCC/CCR and DHDS.
      * HPCL, Visakh: Throughput lower due to CDU deferred shutdown taken for T&I in Nov-Dec, 2017 planned in vis -a-vis July-Aug 2017.
      * CPCL CBR: Throughput lower due to product upliftment constraints .

    3.2 Production in JV refineries during December, 2017 was 1625.05 TMT which is 10.7% higher than the target for the month and 3.44% higher than the production achieved in the corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-December, 2017 was 10942.45 TMT which is 0.5% lower than the target for the period and 13.82% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year.


    3.3 Production in private refineries during December, 2017 was 7710.46 TMT which is marginally lower (0.01%) than the target for the month and 0.79% lower when compared with December, 2016. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-December, 2017 was 68961.98 TMT which is 1.54% higher than the target for the period and 0.77% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year.


    3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of December, 2017 and cumulatively for the period April-December, 2017 vis-à-vis April-December, 2016 are given at Annexures - IV and V respectively.
