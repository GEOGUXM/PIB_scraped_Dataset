    The Economic Survey 2017-18, tabled today in Parliament by the Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitely, presents a unique State-wise comparison of the performance of the Service sector in India.
    
    Out of the 32 States and Union Territories (UTs), in 15 states and UTs, the Services Sector is the dominant sector, contributing more than half of the Gross State Value Added (GSVA). The major services in most of the States are trade, hotels and restaurants, followed by real estate, ownership of dwellings and business services.
    
    However, there is wide variation in terms of share and growth of services GSVA. Out of the 32 States and UTs for which data are available for 2016-17 (or latest year for which data are available), in terms of services GSVA share, Delhi and Chandigarh are at the top with over 80 per cent share, while Sikkim is at the bottom with 31.7 per cent share. In terms of services GSVA growth, Bihar is at the top and Uttar Pradesh at the bottom with 14.5 per cent and 7.0 per cent growth respectively in 2016-17.
