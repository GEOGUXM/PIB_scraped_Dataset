    The Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, Dr. Rajiv Kumar has said that the GDP growth will become more robust in 2018-19. Reacting on the growth estimates released today, he said that the Second half GDP growth in 2017-18 has risen to 7% bringing the annual growth rate to 6.5%. The Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog pointed out that economic activity has been picking up over the last three quarters and can be expected to strengthen in the coming period with the manufacturing PMI now reading at a five year high of 54%, and FMCG demand picking up briskly. Hence the GDP growth will become more robust in 2018-19. He added that the estimates assume significance in the wake of the fact that the higher second half growth has come despite a weaning of public sector expenditures which had peaked in 2016-17 on account of the implementation of the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission.
