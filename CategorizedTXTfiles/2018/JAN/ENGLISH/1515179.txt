    Background:

      * One of the major problems for a commercially viable and safe navigation on NW-1 is low depth upstream of Farakka due to low discharges from tributaries and difficult hydro morphological characteristics of river Ganga.
      * A pilot study on the Allahabad-Ghazipur stretch was commissioned by Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) to find solutions to this problem.
      * Based on the findings of this study, a proposal for development of NW-1 at an estimated cost of Rs. 4,200 crore (US$ 700 million) was taken up for seeking technical assistance and investment support from the World Bank to the tune of US$ 350 million in three Phases.
      * Finance Minister announced JMVP in Budget Speech in July 2014, to enable commercial navigation of at least 1500 tonnes vessels in Ganga.

    BACKGROUNDER NOTE


    Implementation strategy/ and targets:

      * Fairway development through performance based contract for least assured depth of 2.2 metres to 3 metres and bottom channel width of 45 metres, bank protection works, and provisions of navigation aids.

    Funding Pattern:


      * IBRD loan component: Rs. 2, 512 crore (US$ 375 million).

      * Government of India counterpart funds: Rs. 2, 556 crore (US$ 380 million), to be sourced from budgetary allocation and proceeds from bond issue .
      * Private sector participation under PPP mode: Rs. 301 crore (US$45 million) .
