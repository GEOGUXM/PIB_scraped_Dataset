    Four among the Central Research Councils functioning under the Ministry of AYUSH, namely Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS), Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine (CCRUM), Central Council for Research in Siddha (CCRS) and Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH) are involved in research activities, including development of new drugs.


    The Research Councils under Ministry of AYUSH are actively involved in the scientific process of drug development adopting prevalent guidelines. The process involves standardization of raw drug followed by drug proving, clinical verification and clinical trial. The entire process takes considerable time in completion.
