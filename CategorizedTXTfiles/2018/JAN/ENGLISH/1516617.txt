    The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has said that serving the unnerved should be the motto of working people like doctors and civil servants. Inaugurating a medical camp at Swarna Bharat Trust in Nellore today, he stressed on the need to help the poorest of the poor.


    The Vice President said that everyone must draw inspiration from the life of Swami Vivekananda and imbibe qualities like him to serve the society and country at large.


    Talking on the importance of the Makar Sankranti festival, the Vice President said all festivals of our country send the message of humanism, living together and promoting good deeds. We must leave all the bad things behind and embrace the good things from the past to make a better tomorrow.


    Later the Vice President met with people from nearby villages who came to wish him on Sankranti. Shri M Venkaiah Naidu also interacted with farmers and several other representatives of the Nellore district and exchanged pleasantries.
