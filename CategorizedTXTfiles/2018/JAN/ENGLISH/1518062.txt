      Posted On: 29 JAN 2018 12:41PM by PIB Delhi


    The Economic Survey 2017- 18 highlights Government of India’s commitment to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG- 4) for education. It mentioned the significant progress made in universalising primary education, with substantial improvement in the enrolment and completion rates of education of children in both primary and elementary school. The Survey takes note of the increased percentage of schools which comply with the Student Classroom Ratio (SCR) and Pupil Teacher Ratio (PTR) at the all India level. This was stated in the Economic Survey 2017- 18 tabled in Parliament today by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Shri Arun Jaitley .


    The Survey, however, notes the inter-state variations in the adherence to Student Classroom Ratio (SCR) and Pupil Teacher Ratios (PTR) norms. Taking note of the substantially improved Gender Parity Index (GPI) at the primary and secondary levels of school enrolment with the consistent efforts of the government, the Survey acknowledges the success of programmes like Beti Padhao , Beti Bachao in addressing issues of gender bias in access to education.
