    Two other young future prospects will be in action on the first day itself when Anu Kumar of Uttrakhand, who has represented India at the World Youth Games in France is expected to be the star performer in the 1500m Final alongside teammate Bharat Verma.


    The other four finals are the Boys shot put and triple Jump and the same for girls.


    In the girls 1500m, Anu Joseph (Kerala) and Varshar (Karnataka) will also be the ones to watch alongside Hemlata (TN) and Alena Joy (Kerala).


    Amongst the Girls’ Shot Putters Shiksha and Rekha of Haryana will be the ones to look out for while MP's Kartikey Derwal and Haryana’s Saurabh Sheoran are expected to be among the top contenders among boys.
