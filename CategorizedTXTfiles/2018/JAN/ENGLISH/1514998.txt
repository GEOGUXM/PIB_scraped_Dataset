    (iv) Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)


    There are certain groups among Scheduled Tribes who have declining or stagnant population, low level of literacy, pre-agricultural level of technology and are economically backward. These groups are among the most vulnerable sections of our society as they are few in numbers, have not attained any significant level of social and economic development and generally inhabit remote localities having poor infrastructure and administrative support. 75 such groups in 18 States and one UT have been identified and categorized as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). The scheme is implemented in accordance with CCD (Conservative-cum-Development) / Annual Plans prepared by the State / UT through various agencies of the State Government/UT Admn like Integrated Tribal Development Projects (ITDPs) / Integrated Tribal Development Agencies (ITDAs) and Tribal Research Institutes (TRIs). It is a 100% Central Sector Scheme.


    (v) Scheme of Grant-in-aid to voluntary organizations working for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes.


    The Scheme was launched in 1953-54 and was last revised w.e.f. 1 st April 2008. The prime objective of the scheme is to enhance the reach of welfare schemes of Government and fill the gaps in service deficient tribal areas, in the sectors such as education, health, drinking water, agro-horticultural productivity, social security net etc. through the efforts of voluntary organizations, and to provide favourable environment for socio-economic upliftment and overall development of the Scheduled Tribes (STs). Any other innovative activity having direct positive impact on the socio-economic development or livelihood generation of STs may also be considered through voluntary efforts. The scheme is Central Sector Scheme. The grants are provided to the non-governmental organizations on application, in a prescribed format, duly recommended by the multi-disciplinary State Level Committee of the concerned State Government/UT Administration. Funds are generally provided to the extent of 90% by the Government. The voluntary organization is expected to bear the remaining 10% balance from its own resources.


    (vi) Vocational Training in Tribal Areas.


    The main aim of the Scheme is to develop the skills of the ST youth for a variety of jobs as well as self-employment and to improve their socio-economic condition by enhancing their income. The scheme covers all the State and Union Territories. It is not an area-specific scheme, the condition being that free vocational training facilities are extended only to tribal youth 100% grants under the scheme are provided to the State, Union Territories and other Associations implementing the Scheme. Each Vocational Training Centre (VTC) under the Scheme may cater to 5 vocational courses in traditional skills depending upon the employment potential of the area. Keeping in view the limited potential of even skilled persons in interiors areas, each ST boy/girl is trained in two trades of his/her choice, the course in each trade being for duration of three months. Each trainee is to be attached at the end of six months to a master craftsman in a semi-urban/urban area for a period of six months, to learn his/her skills by practical experience. The scheme has been revised with effect from 1.4.2009 to provide enhanced financial norms and to ensure linkages of vocational courses with recognized certificate/diploma through affiliation/accreditation of courses and institutions under Modular Employable Skills and Craftsman Training Scheme by National Council of Vocational Training of Ministry of Labour and Employment.


    (vii) Scheme of Strengthening Education among ST Girls in Low Literacy Districts.


    The primary objective of this Central Sector Scheme is promotion of education among tribal girls in the identified low literacy districts of the country. The scheme, revised w.e.f. 1 st April 2008, aims to improve the socio-economic status of the poor and illiterate tribal population through the education of women. The Scheme has been revised with effect from 1.4.2008. Now it is being implemented in 54 identified low literacy districts where ST Population is 25% or more and ST female literacy rate is below 35% as per 2001 census. The Scheme aims to bridge the gap in literacy levels between the general female population and tribal women and is meant exclusively for ST Girls. The educational complexes are established in rural areas of identified districts and have classes I to V with a provision for upgradation up to class XII, provided there is sufficient accommodation for classrooms, hostel, a kitchen, gardening and for sports facilities. The educational complexes impart not only formal education to tribal girls but also train the students in agriculture, animal husbandry, other vocations and crafts to make them economically strong.


    (viii) Support to Tribal Research Institutes

Based on independent evaluation of the performance of both the sub-schemes and keeping in view the basic objectives of the two and the need for more focused interventions, the sub-schemes were merged into a single Central Sector Scheme titled “Institutional Support for Development and Marketing of Tribal Products/Produce” for the remaining period of the 12 th Five Year Plan. The revised scheme focuses on socio-economic security of the tribal population through market intervention, skill up-gradation and infrastructural support.

Procurement and Marketing operations at pre-fixed MSP is undertaken by designated State agencies. Being a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, the funds are released to the States in the ratio of 75% Central Government share: 25% State Government share.
