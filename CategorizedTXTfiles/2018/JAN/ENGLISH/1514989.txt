    The current procedure followed by Central Water Commission (CWC)/Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (MoWR, RD & GR) for clearance of irrigation projects is as follows:


    The Preliminary Report of an irrigation project is submitted by the State Govt./Project Authority to CWC for “In-principle consent” for preparation of Detailed Project Report (DPR).


    After receiving “In-principle consent”, the DPR is prepared by the Project authority and is submitted to CWC for techno economical appraisal. Further, Statutory Clearances such as Environmental Clearance and Forest Clearance from Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF & CC), clearance from Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) etc. are also to be submitted by the Project Authority.


    The “Advisory Committee of MoWR, RD & GR constituted for consideration of techno-economic viability of Major, Medium Irrigation, Flood Control and Multipurpose project” considers such proposals for techno economical clearance.


    Subsequently investment clearance proposals are submitted by states which are considered for approval by the Committee of MoWR, RD & GR constituted for said purpose.


    This information was given by Union Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
