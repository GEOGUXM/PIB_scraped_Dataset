    The service life of a ship / submarine varies between 25 to 30 years depending on the class, type and size of platform. Various factors govern the operation of ships / submarines beyond their life span such as force level requirements, utility of the platform, planned replacements of ships / submarines and their induction schedule, status of hull machinery, weapons, sensors as well as equipment and material upgrades and life extension under taken. The submarines periodically undergo extensive overhaul, which significantly enhances their combat-worthiness. Further, Major Refit with Life Certification (MRLC) of vintage conventional submarines are planned. All units of Indian Navy follow a comprehensive Operational cum Refit cycle. The Government of India had approved a 30 year Long Term Submarine Building Plan which entails indigenous construction of modern Conventional Submarines by 2030.
