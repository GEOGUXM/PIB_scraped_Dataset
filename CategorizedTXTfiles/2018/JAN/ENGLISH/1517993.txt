    The Prime Minister appealed to the Cadets to promote digital transactions through the BHIM App, and to motivate others to join that platform. He said that this a step towards transparency and accountability. Once the youth of India decide something, everything is possible, he added.


    The Prime Minister said that earlier, people believed that nothing happens to the rich and powerful. But, he added that things are different today. People who served as Chief Ministers are in jail for their corruption, he asserted.
