    The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has assured he will convene a meeting with the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister to accelerate development in eight most backward districts of the State. Chairing a meeting of the MHA, NITI Aayog and delegated Senior Officers of the respective districts, here today, the Union Home Minister said he will visit all the districts thereupon to review the implementation of the District Action Plan.


    The eight districts in Uttar Pradesh are among those 115 backward districts across the country picked up by the NITI Aayog for rapid transformation by 2022. For each of the Districts, a senior official in the rank of Additional Secretary and Joint Secretary has been nominated as Prabhari Officer. The eight districts are Bahraich, Balrampur, Chandauli, Chitrakoot, Fatehpur, Shravasti, Siddharth Nagar and Sonbhadra.


    Prabhari Officers, who have undertaken a visit to their respective districts, said the districts fared poorly in Health and Nutrition and Primary Education. Most districts lacked Infrastructure and the acute shortage of doctors and paramedics in Government Hospitals and Clinics. To overcome the shortage of teachers in schools, it was proposed that there should be localized recruitment.


    The 115 backward districts have been allotted to various nodal Central Ministries for real-time monitoring and ranking. MHA has been delegated responsibility in respect of 35 Left Wing Extremism affected districts.


    Prabhari Officers of the eight districts and Senior Officers of MHA and NITI Aayog attended the meeting.
