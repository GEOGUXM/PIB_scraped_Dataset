The index for ‘Manufacture of Beverages’ group rose by 0.2 percent to 119.7 (provisional) from 119.5 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of bottled mineral water (3%) and aerated drinks/soft drinks (incl.soft drink concentrates) (2%). However, the price of wine, beer and spirits (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Textiles’ group declined by 0.4 percent to 113.0 (provisional) from 113.5 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of manufacture of cordage, rope, twine & netting and weaving & finishing of textiles (2% each). However, the price of viscose yarn (2%) and manufacture of other textiles, woollen yarn, texturised & twisted yarn, manufacture of knitted & crocheted fabrics, cotton yarn and synthetic yarn (1% each)

The index for ‘Manufacture of Wood and of Products of Wood and Cork’ group declined by 1.0 percent to 130.3 (provisional) from 131.6 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of wooden board (non-electrical) (10%), wooden box/crate (6%), wooden block-compressed or not and timber/wooden plank, sawn/resawn (3% each) and wooden splint (1%). However, the price of wood cutting, processed/sized and plywood block boards (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Paper and Paper Products’ group rose by 0.3 percent to 118.4 (provisional) from 118.1 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of tissue paper (3%) and paper carton/box, newsprint, base paper, bristle paper board, paper for printing & writing and kraft paper (1% each). However, the price of corrugated sheet box and duplex paper (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Printing and Reproduction of Recorded Media’ group rose by 0.8 percent to 143.7 (provisional) from 142.5 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of newspaper (3%), journal/periodical (2%) and printed labels/posters/calendars, sticker plastic and printed form & schedule (1% each). However, the price of hologram (3d) (3%) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Pharmaceuticals, Medicinal Chemical and Botanical Products’ group rose by 1.2 percent to 123.1 (provisional) from 121.6 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of anti cancer drugs (5%), plastic capsules (3%), api & formulations of vitamins and antipyretic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory formulations (2% each) and ayurvedic medicaments, antibiotics & preparations thereof and cotton wool (medicinal) (1% each). However, the price of anti inflammatory preparation (17%), vaccine for hepatitis-B (14%), antiseptics and disinfectants (6%), antioxidants (2%) and vials/ampoule, glass, empty or filled and anti-malarial drugs (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Rubber and Plastics Products’ group declined by 0.1 percent to 107.5 (provisional) from 107.6 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of rubberized dipped fabric (6%), rubber tubes-not for tyres (4%), polyester film (non-metalized) and rubber crumb (2% each) and rubber cloth/sheet, rubber moulded goods, PVC fittings & other accessories, plastic film, plastic tube (flexible/non-flexible), tooth brush, plastic button, medium & heavy commercial vehicle tyre, conveyer belt (fibre based) and rubber tread (1% each). However, the price of rubber components & parts (4%), plastic bag (2%) and solid rubber tyres/wheels, plastic box/container, polypropylene film, tractor tyre and motor car tyre (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of other Non-Metallic Mineral Products’ group rose by 0.2 percent to 111.6 (provisional) from 111.4 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of cement blocks (concrete) (7%), porcelain sanitary ware (3%), porcelain crockery and railway sleeper (2% each) and ordinary sheet glass, lime & calcium carbonate, ordinary ortland cement, poles & posts of concrete, marble slab and pozzolana cement (1% each). However, the price of stone, chip, asbestos corrugated sheet and cement superfine (2% each) and toughened glass, non ceramic tiles, clinker and graphite rod (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Computer, Electronic and Optical Products’ group rose by 0.4 percent to 110.7 (provisional) from 110.3 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of colour TV (2%) and meter (non-electrical) and ups in solid state drives (1% each). However, the price of capacitors (2%) and sunglasses and electronic printed circuit board (pcb)/micro circuit (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Machinery and Equipment’ group declined by 0.2 percent to 109.2 (provisional) from 109.4 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of pressure vessel & tank for fermentation & other food processing (6%), cranes (4%), excavator (3%), solar power system (solar panel & attachable equipment), pharmaceutical machinery, air filters, concrete vibrator & mixture and air gas compressor including compressor for refrigerator (2% each) and clutches & shaft couplings and mining, quarrying & metallurgical machinery/parts (1% each). However, the price of conveyors- non-roller type (5%), drilling machine (3%), gasket kit (2%) and agriculture implements, air or vacuum pump, filtration equipment, sugar machinery, chemical equipment & system, industrial valve, oil pump, centrifugal pumps and rice mill machinery (1% each) moved up.

However, the price of iron/steel furniture (1%) moved up.
