    The Khelo India pledge, launched by the Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sport, Col. Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore has now crossed the million mark. This follows the hugely successful launch of the Khelo India Anthem, which reached more than 200 million fans within two days of its launch.


    The Khelo India pledge, now taken by more than 1.1 million people, is among the initiatives to popularise the Games, which seeks to identify sportspersons at a very young age and develop them into future champions for India on international platforms.


    The Khelo India pledge aims to invoke the nation's sporting spirit by urging fans and followers to support and encourage sports in every way possible. It is India's pledge to become part of a revolution that will find nation's budding sport talent from the grassroots and offer them a platform to rise and shine at the global level.


    The flagship Khelo India School Games will be held from January 31 to February 8 and it will be held in 16 disciplines at five venues with more than 3,200 competing for 199 sets of medals.


    Don't miss on taking the pledge. A #NewIndia can't be built without nurturing the sport stars of India. Every fan can be a part of this movement by taking the pledge at www.kheloindia.gov.in or by giving missed call to 902-900-1431
