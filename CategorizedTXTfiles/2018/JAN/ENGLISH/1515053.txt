      Posted On: 02 JAN 2018 5:48PM by PIB Delhi


    Majority of the ammunition for Indian Army is procured domestically, primarily from Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), Defence Public Sector Undertakings and other Public Sector Undertakings. On an average, approximately two-third of the ammunition is sourced indigenously and the remaining through imports. Presently, the Indian private industry supplies only raw materials and some components of the ammunition and have not yet manufactured finished ammunition products. As of now, the Government has presently approved a proposal for manufacturing of eight types of ammunition for Indian Army by Indian Industry.


    Majority of the ammunition is already being procured from the sources within the country.


    This information was given by Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri Ram Kumar Kashyap in Rajya Sabha today.
