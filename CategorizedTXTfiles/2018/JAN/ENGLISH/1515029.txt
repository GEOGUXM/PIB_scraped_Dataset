      Posted On: 02 JAN 2018 5:39PM by PIB Delhi


    The combined amount of tuition fee and hostel charges for the children of martyrs or those disabled in action has been capped at Rs.10,000/- p.m. in accordance with the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission (7th CPC) as accepted by the Government. The allowance shall go up by 25 percent each time DA rises by 50 percent.


    Approximately 250 students have been reported to be affected during current financial year. The figure is subject to change on yearly basis.


    Keeping in view that both the number of students and the tuition / hostel fee are open-ended, no fixed / uniform amount of savings can be indicated. Out of total reported 2679 students during the year 2017-18 (upto 27th December, 2017) 193 students have been reported to be drawing more than the capped amount of tuition / hostel fee and savings have been reported to be Rs.3.20 crore (Approximately). The highest amount drawn has been reported to be Rs.18.95 lakh per annum per student. If all the enrolled students start drawing more than the admissible amount, the saving will also increase, accordingly.


    Representations have been received asking for removal of cap of Rs.10,000/-pm on combined amount of tuition fee and hostel charges. The reply has been sent stating that the combined amount of tuition fee and hostel charges has been capped at Rs.10,000/-pm in accordance with the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission (7th CPC) as accepted by the Government.


    This information was given by Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri Rajeev Shukla and Shri Ritabrata Banerjee in Rajya Sabha today.
