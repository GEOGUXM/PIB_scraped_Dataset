      Posted On: 23 JAN 2018 7:36PM by PIB Delhi


    Though remote control car keys are very common nowadays, invitees/spectators carrying them used to face inconvenience, as the same is not allowed inside the seating enclosures due to security reasons during Republic Day Parade.


    The issue of making arrangements outside the seating enclosures for deposit of remote car keys brought by invitees, has been raised from time to time.


    For the convenience of the invitees, arrangements for deposit of remote car keys brought by them have been made in each Parking Area during Republic Day Parade -2018.


    Two such remote car key deposit booths, one on the South side of Rajpath and another on the North of Rajpath, will also be set up during Beating Retreat Ceremony-2018 and the shows on 27 th & 28 th January, 2018.
