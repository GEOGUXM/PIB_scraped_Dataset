      Residential Schools for Tribal Students
      Posted On: 02 JAN 2018 4:41PM by PIB Delhi


      Ekalavya Model Residential Schools (EMRSs), with the capacity of 480 students in each school, are set up in the States/ UTs under Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution of India. The capital cost for setting up the school complex, including hostels and staff quarters etc. has been earmarked as Rs. 12.00 crore with a provision to go up to Rs.16.00 crore in hill areas, deserts and islands. Recurring cost during the first year for schools would @ Rs. 42000/-per child, with provision of raising it by 10% every second year to compensate for inflation etc.


      Besides, the Ministry also provides funds for setting up residential Ashram schools under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme `Establishment of Ashram Schools in Tribal Sub Plan Areas`. As per extant provisions of the Scheme, State Governments are eligible for 100% central share for construction of all Girls’ Ashram Schools and also for construction of Boys’ Ashram Schools in naxal affected areas. The funding pattern for the other Boys’ Ashram Schools is on 50:50 basis, while cent percent assistance is given to UTs for construction of both Girls’ and Boys’ Ashram Schools.


      The above schemes are demand driven and implemented through the State Governments/UTs. Funds are sanctioned by the Ministry under these scheme based on the proposal received from the State Governments including State of Jammu and Kashmir. A statement showing release of funds to the State Governments for EMRSs during last three years is given below:-
