    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has paid tributes to Guru Ravidas on the occasion of Guru Ravidas Jayanti.


    “ I bow to Guru Ravidas Ji on his Jayanti. Guru Ravidas Ji was one of the greatest Saints to have been born in our land. He stood for a society that is equal, just and compassionate. His teachings are eternal and are relevant for people of all sections of society.


    Guru Ravidas Ji ushered in several positive changes in our society. He questioned practices that were archaic and regressive, and inspired people to change with the times. This spirit of inquiry and emphasis on moving with the times makes extremely great.


    Guru Ravidas Ji had unwavering faith in values of harmony and brotherhood. He did not believe in any kind of discrimination. When we work with the motto of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ we are deeply motivated by Guru Ravidas Ji’s emphasis on serving every human, especially the poor .


    Today I would like to share these words of Guru Ravidas Ji:


    ऐसा चाहूँ राज मैं जहाँ मिलै सबन को अन्न।


    छोट बड़ो सब सम बसै , रैदास रहै प्रसन्न।।


    Guru Ravidas Ji dreamt of a time when everybody has enough to eat and every person is happy”, the Prime Minister said.
