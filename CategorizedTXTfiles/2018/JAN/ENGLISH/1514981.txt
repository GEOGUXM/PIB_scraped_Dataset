    The Government is implementing a Scheme, namely the Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS) that provides grant-in-aid to non-governmental organizations for various projects relating to rehabilitation of persons with disabilities. The objective of the scheme is to enable persons with disabilities to reach and maintain their optimal, physical, sensory, intellectual, psychiatric or social functional levels. Government is also implementing the Scheme of Assistance to Disabled Persons for Purchase of Aids/Appliances (ADIP) under which grants-in-aid is released to various implementing agencies (Artificial Limb Manufacturing Corporation of India/ National Institutes / Composite Regional Centres /District Disability Rehabilitation Centres/ State Handicapped Development Corporation/ other local bodies/ NGOs) to assist the needy disabled persons in procuring durable, sophisticated and scientifically manufactured, modern, standard aids and appliances.


    The objective of the Scheme is to promote physical, social and psychological rehabilitation of persons with disabilities by reducing the effect of disabilities and at the same time enhance their economic potential. Under the ADIP Scheme, aids and assistive devices are provided to persons with disabilities having 40% and above disability.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Vijay Sampla in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
