      Posted On: 02 JAN 2018 5:41PM by PIB Delhi


    The geo-strategic importance of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) has seen a gradual increase in the recent past. Indian Navy closely monitors the maritime areas of our interest and regularly deploys ships for Presence and Surveillance Missions (PSM), off critical choke points / sea lanes in the IOR. Since August 2017, Indian Navy deployments in the IOR have been further structured under the Mission Based Deployment (MBD) concept.
