In some examinations, the question papers are in English only. However, in the Civil Services Examinations conducted by UPSC, candidates are provided the option of answering all the question papers, except the Qualifying Language Papers, Paper-A and Paper-B, in any of the languages included in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India or in English. Also, in the examination for recruitment of Multi Tasking Staff (non-Technical), conducted by SSC, the candidates have the option of answering in the descriptive paper in English or in any language included in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India.
