      Posted On: 02 JAN 2018 5:35PM by PIB Delhi


    Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) has issued guidelines vide OM No.W-02/0015/2016-DPE(WC)-GL-XXIV/17 dated 24th November, 2017 conveying the decision of the Government that the 8th round of wage negotiations (which falls due on general basis from 01.01.2017) with the workers of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) may be undertaken by the Managements of the Enterprises with their Trade Unions/Associations.


    As per guidelines, management of the CPSEs would be free to negotiate wage revision for workmen where the periodicity of wage settlement of five years or ten years has expired generally on 31.12.2016 keeping in view the affordability and financial sustainability of such wage revision for the CPSEs.


    However, no time frame has been laid down in the guidelines issued by the Government for completion of wage negotiations by the management of CPSEs with Trade Unions/Associations.


    This information was given by Minister of State in the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Shri Babul Supriyo in reply to a written question in the Lok Sabha today.
