      Minister of State ( IC ) for Power and New & Renewable Energy, Shri Raj Kumar Singh, in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today, informed that the outcome of the Perform Achieve and Trade ( PAT ) scheme has exceeded the expectations, as the realized energy saving of 8 . 67 Million Tonnes of Oil Equivalent ( MTOE ) is about 30 % more than the assigned energy saving targets of 6 . 68 MTOE .


      Shri Singh informed that under the scheme, PAT Cycle - I was completed in March, 2015 . In this cycle, 478 Designated Consumers ( DCs ) belonging to 8 sectors ( Aluminium, Cement, Chlor - Alkali, Fertilizer, Iron & Steel, Pulp & Paper, Thermal Power and Textile ) were notified with mandatory specific energy consumption ( i . e . energy use per unit of production ) reduction targets .


      Further, these cumulative energy saving targets of 6 . 68 MTOE were to be achieved in a cycle of 3 years . At the end of the PAT Cycle - I, upon monitoring and verification ( M&V ) , which was carried out by third party energy auditors, accredited and empanelled by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency ( BEE ) , it has been assessed that these DCs have collectively achieved energy savings of about 8 . 67 MTOE .


      The sector - wise details of the energy saving targets assigned at the beginning and achievements at the end of the PAT Cycle - I are given below:
