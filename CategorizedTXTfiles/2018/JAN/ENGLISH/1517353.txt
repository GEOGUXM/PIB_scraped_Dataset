    Following is the text of the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi’s departure statement prior to his visit to Davos.


    “I look forward to my first visit to the World Economic Forum at Davos, at the invitation of India’s good friend and Founder of the WEF, Prof Klaus Schwab. The theme of the Forum, “Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World” is both thoughtful and apt.


    The existing and emerging challenges to the contemporary international system and global governance architecture deserve serious attention of leaders, governments, policy makers, corporates and civil societies around the world.


    In recent years, India’s engagement with the outside world has become truly and effectively multi-dimensional covering the political, economic, people to people, security and other spheres.


    At Davos, I look forward to sharing my vision for India’s future engagement with the international community.


    Apart from the events for the World Economic Forum, I look forward to my separate bilateral meetings with the President of the Swiss Confederation H. E. Mr. Alain_Berset and Prime Minister of Sweden H. E. Mr. Stefan Lofven.


    I am confident that these bilateral meetings would be fruitful and give a boost to our relations with these countries and further strengthen economic engagement”.
