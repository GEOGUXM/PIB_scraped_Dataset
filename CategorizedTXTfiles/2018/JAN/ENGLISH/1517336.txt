    The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu received the first copy of the book “Home at Last: A Journey to Higher Consciousness”, from the author Smt. Sarada Chiruvolu, here today.


    In the book, Smt. Sarada Chiruvolu has shared her personal experiences and talks extensively about the powerful process of Kundalini awakening. “Home at Last” is a first of its kind book which explains, in an easy-to-understand manner, the landmarks one may experience in the journey to enlightenment, author said.


    Meditation is the ultimate process of human evolution to realize who we are, why we are here and the purpose of this existence. It is all about reclaiming or re-establishing the connection with the source we all come from, she said.
