      Posted On: 05 JAN 2018 5:32PM by PIB Delhi


    The Central Statistics Office (CSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation has released the First Advance estimates of national income at constant (2011-12) and current prices, for the financial year 2017-18. These are presented in Statements 1-4.


    2. The First Advance Estimates of GDP have been released in accordance with the release calendar of National Accounts @ . The approach for compiling the advance estimates is based on benchmark-indicator method. The Sector-wise estimates are obtained by extrapolation of indicators like (i) Index of Industrial Production of first 7 months of the financial year, (ii) financial performance of listed companies in the private corporate sector available upto quarter ending September,2017 (iii) 1st advance estimates of crop production, (iv) accounts of Central & State Governments, information on indicators like deposits & credits, passenger and freight earnings of railways, passengers and cargo handled by civil aviation, cargo handled at major sea ports, sales of commercial vehicles etc. available for first 8 months of the financial year.With the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 1 st July 2017 and consequent changes in the tax structure, the total tax revenue used for GDP compilation include non-GST revenue and GST revenue. For the year 2017-18, the Budget estimates of tax revenue as provided by Controller General of Accounts (CGA) has been used for estimating taxes on products at current prices. For compiling taxes on products at constant prices, volume extrapolation is done using volume growth of taxed goods and services and aggregated to get the total volume of taxes. Annual forecast of indicators which are available for first 7/8 months is based on regression using seasonal dummies to account for seasonal fluctuations.Some indicators like IIP has been compiled by dividing the cumulative value for the first 7 months of the current financial year by average of ratio of cumulative value of 7 months to the annual value of past years. The salient features of the estimates are detailed below:

According to the information furnished by the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation (DAC), the production of food grains during the Kharif season of agriculture year 2017-18 was 134.67 million tonnes as compared to 138.52 million tonnes during the same period in 2016-17. In case of livestock sector, estimates of production, mainly in the form of production targets for milk, egg, meat and wool from the Department of Animal Husbandry, Ministry of Agriculture has been used.

Annual forecast of production estimated in respect of these items have been used to extrapolate the Provisional Estimates of value of output of coal, crude petroleum, and other major and minor minerals, respectively. IIP ofmining registered growth rate of 3.4percentduring April-October, 2017-18. The advance estimate of IIP of Mining compiled for the current year has been used for compilation.
