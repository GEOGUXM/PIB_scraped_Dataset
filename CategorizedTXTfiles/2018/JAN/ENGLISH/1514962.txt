      Posted On: 02 JAN 2018 1:21PM by PIB Delhi


      Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has informed that Fast Food has not been separately defined under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and Rules and Regulations made thereunder. However, to address the issue of High Fat, Sugar and Salt (HFSS) in food and associated health risks, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) constituted an Expert Group. The Report of the Expert Group, with its gist, has been uploaded on FSSAI website i.e. www.fssai.gov.in for the information of general public. Further, to help consumers make an informed choice, FSSAI has decided to revise its labelling regulations to include mandatory declaration of total fat, added sugar, salt, trans fat and energy per serving along with its contribution to Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) on front of pack label.


      The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
