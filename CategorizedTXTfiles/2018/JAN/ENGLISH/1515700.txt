    The National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA), provides for coverage of 75% of the rural and 50% of the urban population for receiving foodgrains at highly subsidized prices of Rs.1/2/3 per kg for coarse grains/wheat/rice respectively. Coverage under the Act is under two categories- households covered under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and remaining households as priority households. AAY is therefore a part of NFSA.


    The Act is being implemented in all the States/Union Territories (UTs) and foodgrains as per provisions of the Act, are being allocated for 80.72 crore persons identified by State Governments/ UT Administrations for coverage under the Act. This includes 2.36 crore families belonging to AAY category. The State/UT-wise details of number of persons covered under NFSA are given below in the table


    Under NFSA, there is no provision for any Commission at the national level or District level. The Act provides for State Food Commission (SFC) in every State/UT, for the purpose of monitoring and review of implementation of the Act. The total expenditure on SFC depends on terms and conditions of appointment of Chairperson and Members of the Commission as determined by the State Government, the staff support to the Commission, other expenditure etc. and therefore differs from State to State. Central Government provides one time Central assistance of upto Rs.50 lakh for non-building assets for the State Food Commission.
