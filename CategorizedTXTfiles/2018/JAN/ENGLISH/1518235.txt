The uniform will provide a strong brand identity of the Department of Posts as it provides for easy identification of postmen staff.


    The Department enjoys credibility and respect through the field operatives that is the postmen. He is the face of the Department as he delivers letters and parcels to every door. Therefore, it is important that the uniform he wears, which identifies him with the Department should be such that he stands out. Khadi being indigenous to our culture and comfortable in all climatic zones of the country was found suitable for the postmen.
