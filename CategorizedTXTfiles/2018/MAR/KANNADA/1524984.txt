      * It is my pleasure to be interacting with you today. Over the past few months, I have made it a point to meet with local swachhagrahis whenever I have gone for state visits, and have been truly humbled by the dedicated and inspiring work being done by them in various aspects of ‘swachhata’. I am now convinced that the SBM has reached a very humane stage, and become a true janandolan through your efforts.
