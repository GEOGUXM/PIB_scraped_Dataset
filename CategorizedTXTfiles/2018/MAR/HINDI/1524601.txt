      Atal Bhujal Yojana
      Posted On: 15 MAR 2018 3:45PM by PIB Delhi


      The Government has proposed Atal Bhujal Yojana (ABHY) aimed at sustainable ground water management with community participation in select over-exploited and ground water stressed areas in seven States (Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh). ABHY is designed as a Central Sector Scheme with a total outlay of Rs. 6,000 Crore and is proposed to be implemented with World Bank assistance.


      Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) is regulating ground water development in 23 States/UTs. For enforcement of the regulatory measures in these areas, concerned Deputy Commissioners/ District Magistrates have been directed under Section 5 of ‘The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986’ to take necessary action in case of violations of directives of CGWA. No data regarding illegal mineral water/soft drink bottling plants functioning in the country is available with the Ministry of Water Resources, RD & GR.


      As per the assessment of dynamic ground water resources of country (As on 31 st March 2013) carried out jointly by CGWB and State Ground Water Departments, o ut of the total 6584 numbers of assessment units (Block/ Taluks/ Mandals/ watershed/ Firkka), 1034 units have been categorized as ‘Over-exploited’. State-wise number of ‘Over-exploited’ units are given in the table below. This may be due to increase in population, rapid urbanization & industrialization and other related factors.

      CGWA has prepared draft guidelines which stipulates existing & new industries, infrastructure & mining projects etc. to obtain ‘No Objection Certificate (NOC)’. In the draft guidelines framed by CGWA, it is proposed to levy a water conservation fee for issuance of ‘No Objection Certificate (NOC)’ for ground water abstraction. The rates of water conservation fee have been proposed based on the quantum of ground water abstracted, category of ground water assessment unit and use of ground water. Details of rates proposed are given in the table below . Water Conservation Fee will be utilized by the respective State Governments for implementation of ground water recharge/ water conservation measures.
