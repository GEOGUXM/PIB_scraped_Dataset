    The above works of asset replacement are targeted for liquidation in a period of five years. Outlay of the ₹20,000 crore has been allocated in Budget Estimates 2018-19 also.


    Safety is accorded the highest priority by Indian Railways and all possible steps are undertaken on a continual basis including upgradation of technology to aid safe running of trains. These include replacement of over-aged assets, elimination of unmanned level crossings, adoption of suitable technologies for upgradation and maintenance of track, rolling stock, signalling and interlocking systems, safety drives, greater emphasis on training of officials and inspections at regular intervals to monitor and educate staff for observance of safe practices.


    As a safety culture a well established safety management systems is existing which identifies Safety hazards and unsafe practices in the railway operation so that corrective action can be initiated much before occurrence of a disaster. Instructions have been issued from time to time to inculcate safety habits amongst all railway employees.
