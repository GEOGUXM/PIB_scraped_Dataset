    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, presented the Nari Shakti Puraskar at a function held at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (March 8, 2018) on the occasion of International Women’s Day.


    Speaking on the occasion, the President said discriminating between men and women is essentially a problem of mindsets in society. To ensure composite development of the country, it is necessary to remove such discrimination. Every person in society is responsible for changing such mindsets. We should listen to voices of our daughters and provide them all opportunities to make the most of their lives. We should change customs and traditions that hinder giving equal rights to our daughters.


    The President said that awareness and education are effective tools to overcome gender inequality. Education provides the power and understanding to eradicate distinctions between people in society.
