      Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) were launched on 9th May, 2015. The cover period under these Schemes is 1st June of each year to 31st May of subsequent year. These Schemes are offered/administered through both Public and Private Sector Insurance companies, in tie-up with scheduled commercial banks, Regional Rural Banks and Cooperative Banks.


      PMJJBY offers a renewable one year term life cover of Rupees Two Lakh to all subscribing bank account holders in the age group of 18 to 50 years, covering death due to any reason, for a premium of Rs.330/- per annum per subscriber, to be auto debited from subscriber’s bank account. Similarly, PMSBY offers a renewable oneyear accidental death cum disability cover to all subscribing bank account holders in the age group of 18 to 70 years for a premium of Rs.12/- per annum per subscriber to be auto debited from subscriber’s bank account. The scheme provides a cover of Rs. Two Lakh for accidental death or total permanent disability and Rs One Lakh in case of permanent partial disability.


      PMJJBY and PMSBY provide insurance cover to common people, especially poor and the under-privileged sections of the society. The Government as well as the Public Sector Insurance Companies such as Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) had organized massive campaign to create awareness amongst large sections of population and also carried outreach efforts to facilitate access to the schemes. An exclusive website www.jansuraksha.gov.in, which hosts all relevant material / information including forms, rules etc. related to this scheme in English, Hindi and regional languages, was created. The progress of settlement of claims under the schemes is monitored regularly by the Government. Any complaints in respect of the schemes are dealt in coordination with banks and insurance companies in getting it resolved expeditiously.
