    The annual plans under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) are prepared by the States and UTs based on their requirements and priority. These plans are then appraised and approved/estimated in consultation with the States and UTs as per the programmatic and financial norms of the scheme and availability of budgetary resources. As per the SSA framework of implementation, the States/UTs are not entitled for financial support for activities that have already been implemented by them.


    Funds under the SSA programme are provided by the Central Government to States/UTs based on the approved norms and guidelines of the Scheme. The investment and interventions undertaken by the State Government prior to SSA are not covered under SSA.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Shri Upendra Kushwaha today in a written reply to a Lok Sabha question.
