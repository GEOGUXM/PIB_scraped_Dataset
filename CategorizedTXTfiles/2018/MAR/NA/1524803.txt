    As per information provided by Medical Council of India, there are a total 10,41,395 allopathic doctors registered with the State Medical Councils/Medical Council of India as on 30th September, 2017. Assuming 80% availability, it is estimated that around 8.33 lakh doctors may be actually available for active service. It gives a doctor-population ratio of 1:1596 as per current population estimate of 1.33 billion.


    The Government has taken various steps to increase the number of Allopathic doctors. These efforts include-

     1. Enhancement of maximum intake capacity at MBBS level from 150 to 250.

     1. relaxation in the norms of setting up of Medical College in terms of requirement for land, faculty, staff, bed/bed strength and other infrastructure.


      * III. Strengthening/upgradation of State Government Medical Colleges for starting new PG courses/Increase of PG seats.


      * IV. Establishment of new medical colleges attached with existing district/referral hospitals,


     1. Strengthening/ upgradation of existing State Government/Central Government Medical Colleges to increase MBBS seats.


      * VI. The ratio of teachers to students has been revised from 1:1 to 1:2 for all MD/MS disciplines and 1:1 to 1:3 in subjects of Anesthesiology, Forensic Medicine, Radiotherapy, Medical Oncology, Surgical Oncology and Psychiatry in all medical colleges across the country. Further, teacher: student ratio in public funded Government Medical Colleges for Professor has been increased from 1:2 to 1:3 in all clinical subjects and for Asso. Prof. from 1:1 to 1:2 if the Asso. Prof. is a unit head. This would result in increase in number of specialists in the country.


     1. Enhancement of age limit for appointment/ extension/ re-employment against posts of teachers/dean/principal/ director in medical colleges from 65-70 years.


     1. DNB qualification as well as Foreign qualification have been recognized for appointment as faculty to take care of shortage of faculty.
