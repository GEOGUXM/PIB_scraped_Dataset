      Defence Corridor Meeting held at Trichy on 16th March 2018 at Hotel Sangam
      Brief note on Defence Corridor in Tamilnadu

      Posted On: 16 MAR 2018 2:46PM by PIB Chennai

    Provision for creation of two Defence corridors in the country has been announced by the Union Finance Minister in his budget for 2018 -19. One of these is being set up in Tamil Nadu and the other in Uttar Pradesh.


    The concept of a “ Defence Corridor” was initiated by Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, Honourable Union Minister for Defence, when she addressed a recent interaction between the Ministry of Defence and representatives of various industries in Chennai recently.


    She observed that Tamil Nadu already had a well established eco-system for manufacturing, as demonstrated in the automotive sector, which with right policies and investments, could be converted for defence manufacturing. However since units involved in manufacturing were scattered all over the State, it would be desirable to identify three or four locations with concentration of such industries, and link them physically and infrastructurally to each other in order to optimize and share available resources required for design, testing and skill development, specifically for defence systems.


    With recent policy changes introduced for making defence production more user friendly, many major industrial houses involved in manufacturing have entered the defence sector. These are primarily for manufacture of platforms like ships, submarines, aircraft, helicopters, armoured fighting, artillery systems, etc. These consist of sub-systems equipment and components, which are primarily manufactured by companies in the MSME sector.


    Establishment of the defence corridor in Tamil Nadu is not only aimed at increasing India’s self reliance in the Defence Sector, but also create a minimum of One lakh jobs in Tamil Nadu and propel Tamil Nadu in to leadership position in defence production with a target of 30% of nationwide defence manufacturing.


    A series of interactions have already held at Hosur, Coimbatore and Salem with all the stake holders to obtain inputs on formulating a policy for establishing the defence corridor.


    In Trichy, Ordnance Factory, Trichy has organized the programme.
