    Minister of Commerce & Industry, Suresh Prabhu along with DG WTO Roberto Azevedo addressing a Press Conference at the end of Informal WTO Ministerial Meeting.


    New Delhi Informal WTO Ministerial Meeting was an exercise to create confidence and bring countries together to discuss common issues like food security and agriculture. Although there are differences among countries, there is no substitute to dialogue, bilateral and multilateral, said the Minister.


    DG WTO Roberto Azevedo said that New Delhi was the first opportunity to have a conversation at the political level after Buenos Aires and all the members have realized the seriousness of the situation and have recognized that solutions will have to be worked out by collective effort. The DG WTO went on to say that member countries had frank and manifold dialogue and expressed strong support to the WTO system. He went on to say that although there are tensions in trade relations around the world and there is concern on unilateral decisions taken by some countries which have the probability of escalation, but members are committed to actively engage to find solutions.


    Secretary Commerce, Rita Teaotia and India’s Ambassador to WTO, J.S. Deepak and Special Secretary, Commerce Dr. Anup Wadhawan were also present.
