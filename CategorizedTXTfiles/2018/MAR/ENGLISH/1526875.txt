      Posted On: 28 MAR 2018 6:53PM by PIB Delhi


    At the time of independence, 60,116 track km were available in the country. After independence of the country, 61,291 track km has been further added making it cumulative 1, 21,407 track km.


    Railway tracks are replaced through Track Renewal Works, which is an ongoing process. Track Renewal Works are undertaken as and when a stretch of track becomes due for renewal on the basis of criteria laid down in Indian Railway Permanent Way Manual on age/condition basis viz. traffic carried in terms of gross million tones, incidence of rail fracture/failure, wear of rails, corrosion of rails, maintainability of track as per standards, etc.


    There is no track in unsafe condition in the country. Renewal of track is an ongoing process. If any stretch of track is not renewed in time due to various reasons, suitable speed restrictions, if required, are imposed to ensure safe running of trains. Temporary speed restrictions (TSRs) are imposed for short duration to carry out planned track renewals works, emergent works etc. These TSRs are removed once work is completed.


    For the year 2017-18, a target of 3600 km of Track Renewal in CTR units has been kept against which progress of 3493 km of track renewal has been achieved upto February, 2018. Track renewal target for 2018-19 has been kept as 3900 km in Complete Track Renewal (CTR) units (One km of Through Rail Renewal is counted as 0.5 km CTR units and one km of Through Sleeper Renewal is counted as 0.5 km CTR units).


    This information was given by the Minister of State of Railways Shri Rajen Gohain in


    a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
