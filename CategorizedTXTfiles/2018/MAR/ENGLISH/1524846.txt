      Posted On: 16 MAR 2018 4:51PM by PIB Delhi


    Coal India Limited (CIL) has taken initiatives to undertake the work of extraction of Coal Bed Methane (CBM) from its mining leasehold areas. The initial activities include assessment of CBM potentiality in subsidiaries of Coal India Limited to delineate CBM/CMM blocks in Damodar Valley Basin. Accordingly one block each have been delineated in Jharia coalfields and Raniganj Coalfields.

     1. Jharia Coalfield (in BCCL): A CBM/CMM block has been delineated in BCCL mining leasehold with an area of 24 Sq. Km covering Kapuria, Moonidih, Jarma, Singra blocks.
     2. Raniganj Coalfield (in ECL): A CMM block has been delineated in ECL mining leasehold within an area 57 Sq. KM covering Sripur, Satgram and Kunustoria areas.

    On receipt of modified guidelines from MoP&NG considering exemption of applicability of the Oilfield (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948 and Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 1959 within coal mining leasehold areas, further action will be initiated for extraction of gas and time line will be drawn accordingly.


    A demonstration project was taken-up in Jharia coalfields. Further, for commercial exploitation, CIL is contemplating to extract CBM by engaging experienced developer/service provider through global tender.


    This information was given by the Minister of Railways and Coal Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
