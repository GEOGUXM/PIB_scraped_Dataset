    As informed by banks, as on 28.2.2018, 31.20 crore accounts have been opened under Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) with aggregate deposit balances Rs. 75,572.09 crore. Of these, 25.18 crore (81%) Jan-Dhan accounts are operative. Banks are committed to enhance the number of operative Jan-Dhan accounts.


    Public Sector Banks (PSBs) have reported that no such incidence has been observed presently. Moreover, Jan-Dhan accounts do not have any requirement of maintaining minimum balance.


    Public Sector Banks have reported that by February 2018 only about 59 lakh (1.9%) Jan–Dhan accounts have been closed since launch of the scheme. Jan–Dhan accounts are closed as per request of the account-holder. Some of the Jan-Dhan accounts are closed due to conversion of Jan-Dhan accounts into normal savings account as per request of the account-holder. In some cases accounts are closed due to account-holder having multiple accounts in his/her name in the same bank, as per Reserve Bank of India guidelines dated 10.8.2012 applicable to Basic Savings Bank Deposit (BSBD) accounts including Jan-Dhan accounts.


    This was stated by Shri Shiv Pratap Shukla, Minister of State for Finance in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha.
