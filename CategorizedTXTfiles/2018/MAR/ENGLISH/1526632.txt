    Following is the text of Election Commission of India’s statement on the issue of alleged Date Leak:


    “Today during the announcement of Karnataka Assembly Election, 2018 by the Commission, it was brought to the notice of the Commission that minutes before the official announcement of the Election Schedule, Mr Amit Malviya in a Tweet had already tweeted the date of Poll as 12 th May, 2018 and date of Counting as 18 th May, 2018.


    In another Tweet, he also gave a reference of Times Now News Channel as his source. Though, the reports in tweets mentioned the Polling date as 12 th May, 2018 and Counting date as 18 th May, 2018, it was clarified that actual schedule of Karnataka Assembly Elections has the Counting date as 15 th May, 2018.


    The Commission immediately directed that the matter be probed and necessary and effective action be taken. Accordingly, Commission has constituted a Committee of senior officers of Election Commission of India to investigate the matter and give its report within seven days. The Committee would also suggest steps needed to prevent any such eventuality in future. The Committee set up by the Commission has already sought information from the concerned media organizations and individuals.”
