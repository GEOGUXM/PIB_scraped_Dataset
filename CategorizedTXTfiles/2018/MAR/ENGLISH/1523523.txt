      Posted On: 09 MAR 2018 5:22PM by PIB Delhi


    As on 01.04.17, there are 1,44,698 Railway Bridges of varying ages on Indian Railwaysâ€™ network. There is a well-established system of inspection of railway bridges in Indian Railways. All the bridges are inspected at least twice a year, one before the onset of monsoon and one detailed inspection after the monsoon by the designated officials. In addition, certain bridges are also inspected more frequently depending upon their condition.


    Repair / strengthening / rehabilitation / rebuilding of Railway bridges is a continuous process and is undertaken whenever so warranted by their physical condition as ascertained during these inspections and not on the basis of their ages. Suitable safety measures like imposing speed restrictions and keeping such bridge under close watch are taken till the bridge is repaired / strengthened / rehabilitated / rebuilt. All bridges are safe for train movement at permitted speed.


    During last five years (2012-13 to 2016-17) a total of 3675 bridges have been repaired / strengthened / rehabilitated / rebuilt. As on 01.04.2017, a total of 3017 bridges are sanctioned for repair / strengthening / rehabilitation / rebuilding at a throwforward cost of ` 3581.64 Crore. The Zone-wise break-up is as under:
