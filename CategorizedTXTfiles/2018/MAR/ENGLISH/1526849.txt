      Wastes generated at Nuclear Power Plants
      Posted On: 28 MAR 2018 6:05PM by PIB Delhi


    The wastes generated at the nuclear power stations during the operation of Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) are of low and intermediate radioactivity level. Typically, the quantity of low and intermediate level waste to be stored at site is about 0.15 cubic meters/year/MW. These wastes are appropriately treated, concentrated and subjected to volume reduction. The concentrates are immobilized in inert materials like cement, bitumen, polymers etc. and stored in specially constructed structures located at the site under monitoring. The treated liquids and gases are diluted and discharged under continuous monitoring, ensuring that the discharges are well within the limits set by Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB). The radioactivity level of the stored wastes reduces with time and by the end of the plant life, falls to very low levels.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
