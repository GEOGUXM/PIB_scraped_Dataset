      Posted On: 14 MAR 2018 5:37PM by PIB Delhi


    The Ministry of Defence has informed that the term “shaheed” is not being used by the Indian Army in any of its official communication. No such term is used for the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and Assam Rifles (AR) personnel who are killed in action. However, the Ministry of Home Affairs have decided to issue “Operational Casualty Certificate” in respect of the CAPFs & AR and Central Police Organisations (CPOs) personnel who sacrifice their lives for the Nation. The guidelines have been issued on 09/10/2017.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
