    A s per the 2017 revision of United Nations World Population prospects, Indiaâ€™s population is projected to be 1.50 billion by 2030 only.


    The details of the schemes to restrict the ever increasing population in India are given below:


    STEPS TAKEN TO CHECK THE INCREASE IN POPULATION ARE:

      * Redesigned Contraceptive Packaging: The packaging for Condoms, Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCPs) and Emergency Contraceptive Pills (ECPs) has now been improved and redesigned.
      * New Family Planning Media Campaign has been launched to generate demand for contraceptives.

      * Enhanced Compensation Scheme for Sterilization: The sterilization compensation scheme has been enhanced in 11 high focus states (8 Empowered Action Group (EAG), Assam, Gujarat, Haryana)
      * National Family Planning Indemnity Scheme- Under this scheme clients are indemnified in the unlikely events of deaths, complications and failures following sterilization.
      * Clinical Outreach Team Scheme - The scheme has been launched in 146 Mission ParivarVikas districts for providing Family planning services through mobile teams from accredited organizations in far-flung, underserved and geographically difficult areas.
