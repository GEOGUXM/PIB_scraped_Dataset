    The Government has notified Public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs), Order, 2012 under MSMED Act, 2006 which is effective from 1st April, 2012. It has become mandatory w.e.f 1st April 2015. The Policy has set an annual goal for procurement from the MSE sector at the beginning of the year, with the objective of achieving an overall procurement goal of minimum 20 per cent of the total annual purchases of the products or services produced or rendered by MSEs from the latter, in a period of three years. Out of 20% target of annual procurement from MSEs, a sub-target of 4% (i.e. 20% out of 20%) will be earmarked for procurement from MSEs owned by SC / ST entrepreneurs. However, in the event of failure of such MSEs to participate in the tender process or meet the tender requirements and the L1 price, the 4% sub-target for procurement earmarked for MSE owned by SC / ST entrepreneurs will be met from other MSEs.


    The States / UT wise data on procurement from MSMEs is not maintained in the Ministry. The preamble to the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) – 2016, specifically mentions that enhancing the role of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the Defence Sector is one of the defining features of DPP. Following specific provisions have been introduced in DPP-2016 that would increase the participation of MSMEs in the defence sector:

      * In ‘Make’ category of capital acquisition, Government funded projects with estimated cost of prototype development phase not exceeding Rs.10 crore and Industry funded projects with estimated cost of prototype development phase not exceeding Rs.3 crore are reserved for MSMEs.
      * In addition, it has been mandated to involve MSME associations while carrying out feasibility studies for ‘Make’ projects. MSMEs have also been granted relaxation in the registration and profitability criteria for consideration as eligible “Indian Vendor” for participation in the ‘Make’ projects.
      * In the discharge of offset obligations, a multiplier of 1.50 willbe permitted where MSMEs are Indian Offset Partners (IOPs).
