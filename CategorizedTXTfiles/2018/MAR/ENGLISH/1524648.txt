      Indian Railway goes Digital to motivate Employees to Share Good Work
      Posted On: 15 MAR 2018 5:29PM by PIB Delhi


    Continuing on its transformation journey, Indian Railways has developed an Online Portal called “Rail Good Work Portal” to enable the employees to freely share the good work being done by them and encourage easy and fast replication of these good work by other units.


    This has motivated the employees from various zones, production units and divisions of Indian Railways to freely share the good work done by them. Within a month of launch of this Portal in early February 2018, over 600 such works done have been shared by employees from across the Railway zones. Employees are enthusiastically describing and sharing the initiatives taken by them in various areas of their work like safety improvement, cost reduction, operations improvement, maintenance improvement, improving customer experience, energy conservation & environment improvement, digital initiatives and human resource development.


    The good work samples uploaded by employees are supported with pictures/sketches to facilitate appreciation. The name, mobile number and email id of the person of the railway unit who has implemented the good work is also available on the Portal so as to enable the viewing employees to contact him or her to learn more about the good work and how it can be implemented.


    This Portal provides a unique opportunity to field officers and staff of Railways to showcase their exemplary work which can be replicated across Indian Railways. In times to come this Platform will act as an enabler to the Railway System and also give a lot of confidence and sense of pride in their work to the Railway workforce.
