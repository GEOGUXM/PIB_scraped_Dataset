      Posted On: 05 MAR 2018 3:01PM by PIB Delhi


    DRDO has designed and developed indigenous Surface-to-Air missile system AKASH and NAG Missile (3rd generation fire & forget Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM)). A project for another ATGM has also been taken up.


    In the last two years, five Troops of AKASH were delivered to Indian Army and two Squadrons of AKASH missile systems were delivered to Indian Air Force (IAF). Further, production orders are to be placed by IAF and Army for AKASH missile system. Regarding ‘NAG’ & ‘NAMICA’ initial activities related to Production/Transfer of Technology (ToT) documentation & private/public production partners has been initiated.


    As a result of successful development production and induction of AKASH missiles system, Rs.34,500 Cr foreign exchange could be saved by existing production order and many orders are in pipeline from army and IAF. Since, technology of 'NAG’ is indigenous and production will be carried out at Indian Production Agencies, no ToT / Technology Acquisition/huge import is involved. Therefore, there will be huge saving of Foreign Exchange.


    This information was given by Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman in a written reply to Shri Amar Singh in Rajya Sabha today.
