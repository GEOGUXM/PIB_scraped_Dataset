      Posted On: 14 MAR 2018 8:30PM by PIB Delhi


    Indian Navy has launched a new placement portal for naval veterans, widows and their dependents. The new website has been developed by M/s Silver Touch while the creative look is by M/s Weiden and Kennedy.


    A large number of highly skilled personnel leave Indian Navy, in their 30s and 40s to ensure a young fighting force for the nation. This capable and trained pool of disciplined naval veterans is made available to the Corporate Sector by the Indian Naval Placement Agency (INPA) for harnessing their talents.


    To increase the opportunities available to the retiring naval personnel, the Indian Navy has signed an Agreement with Monster.com which allows members of INPA to receive job alerts from Monster.com and also avail subsidised career services. Monster India aims to list more than 1,000 opportunities in the next 12 months with a target of increasing this number to 2,000 opportunities by year 2020. The partnership will focus on identifying opportunities in sectors such as capital goods industries, IT, security space, ITeS, MSMEs etc for the uniquely skilled talent pool of veterans of the Indian Navy.


    All corporates looking to hire naval veterans can register themselves at INPA website at https://indiannavy.nic.in/INPA .
