      Employment Generation in Railways
      Posted On: 21 MAR 2018 5:30PM by PIB Delhi


    Filling up of vacancies in Railways is a continuous process through various modes of intake. The policy of the Railway administration is to fill up the vacancies as per the laid down procedure through Railway Recruitment Boards (RRBs) and Railway Recruitment Cells (RRCs). There is always a time-lag between occurrence of vacancies and processing the same for filling up, which involves notification of vacancies, holding examinations, finalizing of select panels and issue of appointment letters. However, manpower planning requires continuous review of sanctioned strength in view of ever changing technology, working systems and creation of new assets and introduction of new trains.


    Recently, Railway Recruitment Boards (RRBs) have published two fresh notifications viz. Centralized employment Notification (CEN) No. 01/2018 on 03.02.2018, for recruitment for 26,502 vacancies of Asst. Loco Pilots (ALPs) & Technicians, and CEN No. 02/2018 on 10.02.2018, for recruitment for 62,907 vacancies of Level-1 (erstwhile Group ‘D’) staff. The closing dates of online applications for both these CENs are 31.03.2018.
