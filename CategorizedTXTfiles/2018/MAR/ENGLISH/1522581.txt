    The Ministry of Human Resource Development has invited suggestions on rationalizing curriculum for class I to XII to ensure all round development of students. The Union Minister of Human Resource Development, Shri Prakash Javadekar has said that there is an urgent need to rationalize the school curriculum because the objective of education is to prepare a good human being from the system. Along with academic education, life skills, experiential learning, physical education and creative skills are needed. We need to develop the system where students get time for each of this and can progress in the areas which he or she likes most, therefore there is continuous demand of rationalization of syllabus which many people believe is too heavy and inappropriate for age, Shri Javadekar explained. The HRD Minister has urged all stakeholders including teachers, headmasters, school management, educationalists, parents, students, NGOâ€™s, experts, public representatives and anybody who has interest and opinion on this issue to send their suggestions.
