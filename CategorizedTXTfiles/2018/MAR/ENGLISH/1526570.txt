      Posted On: 27 MAR 2018 3:50PM by PIB Delhi


    Section 10D of Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 prescribes conducting of a uniform entrance examination namely National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to all medical educational institutions at undergraduate and post-graduate level. Accordingly, NEET has been introduced from the academic year 2016-17 and the said examination was successfully conducted in 2017 also. The provision of the IMC Act, 1956 for conducting NEET apply across the country without any exemption to any State.


    NEET has resulted in ensuring better and minimum standards of medical education, curbing malpractices in medical admission, led to greater transparency and reduced the burden on prospective students of appearing in multiple entrance exams.


    The Graduate Medical Education Regulations, 1997 and Postgraduate Medical Education Regulations, 2000 have also been amended to provide for common counselling for admission to medical courses making the entire admission process transparent and merit based.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
