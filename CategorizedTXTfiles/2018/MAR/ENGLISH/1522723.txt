      Posted On: 06 MAR 2018 4:30PM by PIB Delhi


    The Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) shall have to obtain prior permission under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 2010 before acceptance of each foreign contribution.


    The renewal of registration of the PHFI was rendered non-est ab-initio after receiving information of alleged violations of the provisions of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 2010.


    The PHFI shall provide detailed information to the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare regarding utilisation of the foreign contribution at the end of every quarter. A Committee constituted by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare is to review the foreign contribution received and spent by the PHFI on quarterly basis.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.
