    The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has issued Letter of Award (LOA) for development of 4-lane ROB of 0.780 km length near Neleshwaram (Pallikara Railway Gate) of NH-17(New NH-66) in Kerala with total capital cost of Rs 81 Crore to M/s EKK Infrastructure Ltd. on EPC Mode.


    The existing level crossing No. 269 at Pallikara (Nileshwara)in Kasargod district is the busiest level crossing and about 35 No. of trains runs through this level crossing daily, so the gate has to be closed often and thereby causing great difficulty & hardships to the public. It is the only level crossing in the NH between Mumbai and Thiruvananthapuram which has not been upgraded to an ROB. The construction of ROB at Pallikara (Nileshwara) will avoid congestion of traffic and provide a smooth and safe traffic flow conditions enhancing safety aspect. Up-gradation of level crossing to a ROB in this region, by the way of smooth, safe and efficient traffic flow, substantial gain in terms of reduced Vehicle Operating Cost (VOC) and reduced travel time would be achieved.
