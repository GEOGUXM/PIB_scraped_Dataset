    The Central Government regularly reviews the physical and financial progress made under centrally sponsored schemes of Sarva Shiskha Abhiyan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) through review meetings with representatives of States and Union Territories and through field visits.


    The Central Government through the Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiskha Abhiyan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) supports States and Union Territories (UTs) inter alia for creation and augmentation of school infrastructure facilities and for improving quality of education. Under SSA, since its inception in 2001 till 31.12.2017, 3.12 lakh primary and upper primary school buildings, 18.87 lakh additional classrooms, 2.42 lakh drinking water facilities and 10.54 lakh toilet have been sanctioned, out of which States and UTs have reported construction of 2.94 lakh primary and upper primary school buildings, 17.98 lakh additional classrooms and 9.95 lakh toilets and provision of 2.35 lakh drinking water facilities. Under RMSA till 31.12.2017, 12682 new secondary schools, 50,713 additional classrooms, 70,244 toilets and 11,854 drinking water facilities, have been sanctioned out of which 8211 new schools, 35,794 additional classrooms, 49,030 toilets have been constructed and 9,860 drinking water facilities have been provided by the States and UTs.


    Further, the States/UTs are supported on several interventions to improve quality of education including regular in-service teachersâ€™ training, induction training for newly recruited teachers, recruitment of additional teachers for improving pupil teacher ratio, academic support for teachers through block and cluster resource centres. Section 23(2) of the RTE Act, 2009 has been amended to ensure that all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31 st March, 2019.


    The Central Rules to the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 have been amended to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. These would serve as a guideline for State and UTs to ensure that all children acquire appropriate learning level. A National Achievement Survey (NAS) based on learning outcomes has been conducted on 13th November, 2017 for class III, V and VIII with a sample frame up to district level to enable States/UTs to identify gaps in learning outcomes at district level and design strategies to address those gaps. District reports are available along with learning gaps for each district. Similarly, National Achievement Survey for Class X students has been conducted on 5 th February, 2018.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Shri Upendra Kushwaha today in a written reply to a Lok Sabha question.
