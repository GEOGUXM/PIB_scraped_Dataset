    There are 5.27 lakhs Fair Price Shops (FPSs) operational across the country. A State wise statement showing the number of Fair Price Shops is given below in the table.


    The eligible households are entitled to receive subsidised foodgrains i.e. rice, wheat, coarsegrains or any combination thereof under TPDS. The Central issue price for Rice, Wheat and Coarsegrains is Rs 3/-, Rs. 2/- and Rs. 1/- per kg respectively.


    Public Distribution System (PDS) is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and State/UT Governments. Central Govt. is responsible for procurement, allocation and transportation of foodgrains upto the designated depots of the FCI. The operational responsibility for allocation and distribution of foodgrains within the States/UTs, identification of eligible beneficiaries/families, issuance of ration cards to them and supervision and monitoring of functioning of Fair Price Shops (FPSs) rest with the concerned State/UT Government. Instructions have been issued to States/UTs and Food Corporation of India (FCI) to ensure supply of good quality foodgrains under PDS. Therefore, as and when complaints are received by the Government from individuals and organizations as well as through press reports, they are sent to State/UT Governments concerned for inquiry and appropriate action.


    An offence committed in violation of the provisions of TPDS (C) Order, 2015 is liable for penal action under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. Thus, the Order empowers State/UT Governments to take punitive action in case of contravention of relevant provisions of these Orders.
