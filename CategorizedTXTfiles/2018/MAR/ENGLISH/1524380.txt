      Posted On: 14 MAR 2018 5:55PM by PIB Delhi


    The Central Government has issued revised policy on 05.09.2017 for the allocation of cadres to the members of All India Services which will come into effect with the Civil Services Examination â€“ 2017/ Indian Forest Service Examination - 2017. In this policy, all the cadres have been divided into five Zones and a candidate may give preference for these Zones in the order of descending priority as well as preference for cadres within each Zone in descending order. Further, a candidate claiming benefit of reservation under Physically Disabled quota has an additional option to indicate his preference (at the time of indicating preferences for various Zones and Cadres thereunder) for any one state/cadre (other than Home cadre) of his first preferred zone. In case he is found eligible as a Physically disabled candidate and he could not be allocated to his Home Cadre for want of vacancy, then as per policy, he is allocated to that cadre indicated as additional option.


    A candidate who wishes to be considered for All India Services are required to indicate in his Detailed Application Form (DAF) for the Main Examination his order of preferences for various Zones and Cadres for which he would like to be considered for allotment in case he is appointed to any of the All India Services and no request for change in preference of Zone and Cadre thereunder once indicated by a candidate is permitted.


    This was stated by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
