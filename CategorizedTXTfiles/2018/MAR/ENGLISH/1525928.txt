    Twenty seven antiquities have been retrieved from foreign countries during the last three years (2014-2017), out of which eleven antiquities are of Tamil Nadu.


    There are no records available with Archaeological Survey of India regarding ancient idols, sculptures and statues deposited in various museums across the world as well as in private possession. Whenever any illegally exported objects/antiquities of Indian origin surface in a foreign country, efforts are made through Indian Missions abroad for their retrieval.


    The antiquities which have been retrieved include stone sculpture of Brahma and Brahamani from U.K., Stone image of Durga from USA, sandstone image of Nataraja in dancing posture from USA, seated Buddha from Australia, Parrot Lady from Canada, metal image of Bahubali from USA among others.


    This information was given by Minister of State (IC) for Culture and Minister of State for Environment, Forest & Climate Change Dr. Mahesh Sharma in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
