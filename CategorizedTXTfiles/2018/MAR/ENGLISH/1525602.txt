    As a part of “Swachh Bharat Mission”, Indian Railways is proliferating bio-toilets on its coaching stock so that no human waste is discharged from coaches on to the track. In order to demonstrate the advantage of fitment of Bio-toilets, 6 Green corridors were made functional during the year 2016-2017.
