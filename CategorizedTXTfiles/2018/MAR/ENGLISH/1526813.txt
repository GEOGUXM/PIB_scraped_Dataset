      Posted On: 28 MAR 2018 4:41PM by PIB Delhi


    As per Section 20D of Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, (AMASR) Act, 1958, no new constructions are permitted in the prohibited area of centrally protected monuments and sites. The Government has initiated action against encroachments as per the provisions laid down in the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958 and Rules,1959 by filing FIRs, contacting the concerned State authorities and also approaching various courts of law.


    A mechanism for obtaining permission for construction in regulated areas and repairs in prohibited areas exist as per Section 20D of AMASR Act, 1958. The violators are duly reported upon and necessary legal action is initiated as per Section 19 of AMASR Act, 1958 and Rule 38 of AMASR Rules


    The concerned State Governments have been duly sensitized to include necessary permission from Competent Authority, Government of India as per Section 20D of the AMASR Act, 1958 before issuing any permit for construction and repairs.
