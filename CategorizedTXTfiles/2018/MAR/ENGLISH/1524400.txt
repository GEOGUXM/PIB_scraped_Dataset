    This was informed by the Minister of State of Commerce and Industry, Shri C.R.Chaudhary, in the Rajya Sabha today.


    It has been a continuous endeavour of Tea Board and the tea industry to strategize ways and means to increase export and enhance the share of Indian tea in the international market. Focused and sustained initiatives like arranging buyer-seller meets, effecting exchange of delegations, participating in international trade fairs and undertaking generic promotion of Indian brands in key markets are showing results.


    The domestic market of tea has also been growing over the years and has been seen to directly affect the exportable surplus of tea in the country.
