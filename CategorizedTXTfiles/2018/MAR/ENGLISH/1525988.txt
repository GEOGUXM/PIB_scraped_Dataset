    Background:


    In November 2017, the NITI Aayog along with EU Delegation to India released the Strategy paper on Resource Efficiency (RE). The objective of the RE Strategy is to make recommendations for enhancing the resource-use efficiency in the Indian economy and industry, develop indicators for monitoring progress, and create an ecosystem for improving the resource security and minimising environmental impacts.


    The implementation agenda of the RE Strategy consists of Core Action Agenda (2017-2018) and Medium-term Action Plan (2018-2020) in the thematic areas of institutional development, promotion and regulation. The first action agenda was to constitute an inter-departmental group of stakeholders for steering the strategy.
