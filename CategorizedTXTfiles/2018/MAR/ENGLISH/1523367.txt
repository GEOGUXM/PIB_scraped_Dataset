    Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh here today reviewed the progress of schemes being implemented by the Foreigners Division of MHA with a view to improve the efficiency and transparency of various services being provided to Indian and foreign nationals.


    Shri Rajnath Singh appreciated the fact that the e-Visa scheme, introduced in the year 2014 for Tourism category, has been extended to cover Business and Medical categories also and this facility is now available for nationals of 163 countries for entry into India through 25 International Airports and five Sea Ports in the country. Integrated Online Visa System under the Immigration, Visa, Foreigners Registration and Tracking (IVFRT) project has been operationalised in 163 out of 178 Indian Missions abroad. Biometric enrolment has been implemented in 115 Indian Missions. This system facilitates easy sharing and monitoring of visa data on real time basis across various immigration offices. A scheme to provide various visa services online to foreign nationals is also under implementation.


    Shri Rajnath Singh noted the fact that the revamped FCRA website is more user friendly, transparent and ensures hassle-free interaction of the user with the Government. The website ensures that all FCRA services are available through online mode only. For better coordination of the incoming Foreign Contributions (FC), the banks have been integrated with the FCRA System.


    Union Home Secretary Shri Rajiv Gauba, besides Senior Officers of MHA, MEA and Security Agencies were present.
