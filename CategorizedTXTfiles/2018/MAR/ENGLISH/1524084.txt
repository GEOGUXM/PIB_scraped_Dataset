    Government has decided to speed up input tax refund to exporters. As per rule 91 of CGST Rules, 2017, ninety per cent of the refund amount claimed shall be granted on a provisional basis within a period not exceeding seven days from the date of acknowledgement of the refund claim. Further, as per section 54(7) of the CGST Act, 2017, the final order for granting refund shall be issued within sixty days from the date of receipt of the complete application. Out of total taxpayers under GST, 64% were also registered under previous tax regime. No specific study has been undertaken on the impact of GST transition


    64% of the total taxpayers registered under GST have transitioned from the previous tax regime to GST as on 2 nd March, 2018.


    The processing of refund claim is being done after the claimant has filed the GST return and the grant of the refund shall be within sixty days from the date of receipt of the complete application.


    This was stated by Shri Shiv Pratap Shukla, Minister of State for Finance in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
