    During discussions between Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) and M/s Westinghouse Electric Company (WEC) for setting up six units of AP-1000 (6 x 1208 MWe) reactors at Kovvada, Andhra Pradesh, M/s WEC has expressed willingness to continue with the proposed project in India. Further progress in these discussions will depend upon finalization of techno-commercial aspects of the project acceptable to the Indian side and upon establishing the viability of the project. In this regard, a Techno-Commercial Offer has been submitted by M/s WEC to NPCIL, on which negotiations have been initiated. Further progress in the negotiation will also depend on the operation of reference plant of the above design in U.S.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
