    In order to encourage compliant behavior under GST, the Government has undertaken a massive awareness and educational campaign by regularly issuing advertisements in the media (Print/Voice/Visual) to educate the taxpayers about GST laws and procedures. Further, CBEC has conducted various workshops and town hall meetings to educate the taxpayers in this regard. In addition to this, social media (Twitter) has also been extensively used for disseminating information regarding GST laws, rules and tax rates.


    The GST Council has constituted a Committee on invoices under the chairmanship of CEO, GSTN to examine the feasibility of generating invoices on the GST portal and to suggest an incentive scheme to encourage the taxpayers to upload their tax paid invoices online.


    This was stated by Shri Shiv Pratap Shukla, Minister of State for Finance in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
