    Under the National Health Mission, approval of Rs. 22.19 crore has been provided for relief and rehabilitation of patients affected by endosulfan as per proposal of State of Kerala during 2012-13 to 2017-18.


    The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare has informed that the following measures are being taken:


     1. The “Strengthening and Modernization of Pest Management Approach in India” (SMPMA) Scheme is being implemented through 35 Central Integrated Pest Management Centres (CIPMCs) established across the country to keep pest population beloweconomic thresholds level by employing available alternate pest control strategies and techniques viz. preventive measures, cultural, mechanical and biological control with greater emphasis on usage of bio-pesticides and pesticides of plant-origin like Neem formulation etc.


     1. IPMCs inter alia, produce biological agents for release in the fields, conserve natural bio-control agents, promote bio-pesticides as an alternative to chemical pesticides and advocate judicious and safe use of chemical pesticides as a last resort.


      * III. The CIPMCs are also organizing Farmers Field Schools (FFSs) to sensitize farmers on Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach.


      * IV. Thepackage of practices for control of pests and diseases in 87 crops have been revised to include techniques to reduce dependence on chemical pesticides and encourage use of bio-pesticides and other alternative plant protection measures.


     1. Timely advisories are being issued by the Ministry to the State Government disseminating, inter alia management strategies to prevent pests attack.


      * VI. The State Governments through various forums such as Zonal Conferences and National Conference are requested to exhort their extension functionaries to educate and impart training to farmers on efficacious and sustainable pest management strategies /approaches and to maintain constant surveillance.


     1. A “Monitoring of Pesticide Residues at National Level” (MPRNL) scheme is also being implemented , under which food commodities and environmental samples are collected and analyzed for the presence of pesticide residuesThe annual reports of MPRNL are shared with the States for taking corrective measures.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), SmtAnupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the LokSabha here today.
