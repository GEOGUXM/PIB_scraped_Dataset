      Posted On: 14 MAR 2018 4:27PM by PIB Delhi


    Requisite sensitisation of all ranks and training at various levels on Human Rights issues is being ensured and Human Rights training is imparted regularly to the Armed Forces personnel. In addition, Human Rights training forms an important part of the Pre-Induction training (PIT) of the troops in the Corps Battle Schools, before deployment in Counter Insurgency / Counter Terrorism (CI/CT) operations. The Human Rights aspects are also enshrined in the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) commandments, which are reiterated to all the troops before conduct of any operation.


    The said norms are known to all and have been promulgated in the form of Do’s and Dont’s for conduct of operations and are part of COAS commandments.


    There were 17 cases of alleged Human Rights violations received in the last three years (2015-2017). Of these 12 cases have been investigated and found to be false. The balance five cases are under investigation.


    There have been two cases of alleged Human Rights violation received in the current year. Both are under investigation.


    There is zero tolerance to Human Rights violations and all allegations are thoroughly and swiftly investigated and strict action is taken if found guilty of Human Rights violations.


    This information was given by RakshaRajyaMantriDr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Dr. Manoj Rajoriain LokSabha today.
