      Mobile based Application “ASHTRACK” to help Fly Ash Users & Power Plants
      Posted On: 14 MAR 2018 5:58PM by PIB Delhi


    For the better management of fly ash waste from thermal power plants across country, Government has reduced the GST rates on fly ash and its products to 5%. Further, to facilitate 100% ash utilization by all coal based thermal power plants, a web portal for monitoring of fly ash generation and utilization data of Thermal Power Plants and a mobile based application titled “ ASHTRACK ” has been launched that will help to establish a link between fly ash users and power plants executives for obtaining fly ash for its use in various areas.


    To enhance fly ash utilization from Pithead power plants, trial for bulk transportation of fly ash to consumption centre was carried out successfully by NTPC Ltd. with the help of Indian Railway from Shaktinagar Railway Station (NTPC Rihand) to M/s Prism Cement, Satna on 19/20 April 2017.


    As informed by Central Electricity Authority (CEA) fly ash generation and its utilization by 155 thermal power plants for which data has been collected for the year 2016-17 is as below:
