      National Mission for Preservation of Manuscripts
      Posted On: 07 MAR 2018 5:40PM by PIB Delhi


    The project National Mission for Manuscripts (NMM) was launched by the Ministry of Culture in the year 2003 with the objectives to survey, document, and conserve/preserve, digitize and publish the Indian Manuscripts and establish a digital manuscripts library at Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA).


    The budget allocation for the financial year 2018-19 has been increased to Rs. 1500.00 lakh against the budget allocation of Rs. 1200.00 lakh for the financial year 2017-18.


    The final objective of the Mission is to establish a digital National Manuscripts Library at Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) at which scholars and researchers can view the digital copies of the Indian Manuscripts. As the copyright of the manuscripts is reserved with the owners of the manuscripts, at present, only 6 pages (first 3 pages and last 3 pages) can be viewed by the user. To resolve the copyright issue, Ministry has constituted a committee to draft a Bill regarding accessibility of Manuscripts.


    This information was given by Minister of State (IC) for Culture and Minister of State for Environment, Forest & Climate Change Dr. Mahesh Sharma in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
