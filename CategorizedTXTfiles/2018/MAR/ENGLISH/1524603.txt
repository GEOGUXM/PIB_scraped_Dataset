      Posted On: 15 MAR 2018 3:53PM by PIB Delhi


    University Grants Commission (UGC) has notified the UGC (Conferment of Autonomous Status Upon Colleges and Measures for Maintenance of Standards in Autonomous Colleges) Regulations, 2018 on 12 th February, 2018 in the official gazette.


    According to above regulations, Colleges of any discipline whether aided, partially aided and unaided/self financing, after they have completed minimum 10 years of existence are eligible for grant of autonomy provided they are recognised under section 2(f) of the UGC Act, 1956. The colleges must be accredited by either NAAC with minimum ‘A’ Grade or by NBA for at least three programme(s) with a minimum score of 675 individually or a corresponding accreditation Grade/score from a UGC empanelled accreditation agency. However, if the number of programme(s) being run by the Institution is less than three, then each of the programmes should secure 675 or more marks.


    Such autonomous colleges can prescribe their own courses/programmes of study and syllabi and formulate new courses/programmes within the nomenclature specified by UGC as per the Specification of Degrees, 2014 and amended from time to time. These colleges may fix fees of the courses at their own level.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Dr. Satya Pal Singh today in a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question.
