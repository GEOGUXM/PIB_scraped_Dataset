      Operational Cost of Railways
      Posted On: 28 MAR 2018 6:56PM by PIB Delhi


    It has been a continuous endeavor on part of the Railways to control its Working Expenses of which operational cost of Railways is also a part. As a result of various measures taken in this regard, the Railways have been able to substantially control the growth of Ordinary Working Expenses. The Ordinary Working Expenses in 2016-17 and 2017-18 grew only by about 10% despite being the years of implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission recommendations as against about 30% on the earlier occasion.


    The steps taken by the Ministry to reduce the operational cost of Railways are as under:

      * Railways are given spending limits lower than the sanctioned budget. They are also repeatedly instructed to effect savings in revenue expenditure to compensate for unavoidable post-budgetary increases such as revision of diesel prices, hike in power tariff, increase in rates of certain allowances/incentive bonus etc. The expenditure is monitored strictly according to the spending limits through monthly financial reviews.
      * Tight control over expenditure in areas such as fuel/power consumption, contractual payments, purchase of materials etc is maintained.
      * Energy audit of major load centres, effecting savings in electricity bills due to purchase of power by railways as “distribution licensee”
      * Prioritization of expenditure on works/activities for better use of available resources.
      * Improvement in Manpower productivity.
      * Improvement in asset utilization by taking innovative measures and best practices available.
      * Improvement in inventory management.
      * Reducing the cost of operation and maintenance of rolling stock.
