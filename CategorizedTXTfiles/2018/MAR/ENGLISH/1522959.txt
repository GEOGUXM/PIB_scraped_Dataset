      Fixing minimum wages for domestic work
      Posted On: 07 MAR 2018 3:46PM by PIB Delhi


    Many of the State Governments like Rajasthan, Kerala, Punjab, Tamilnadu and Tripura have included domestic workers in the schedule of the Minimum Wages Act and the domestic worker are therefore entitled to file cases before the concerned authorities in case of any grievance in this regard. The registration of the placement agencies is a State subject. An advisory has been issued to all the State Government requesting them to take steps for formulation of a policy at their own level for regulating these placement agencies. Moreover, meetings have been held on 6/12/2017 & 12/2/2018 at Shillong and Kolkata respectively where representatives of the Ministry of Labour and Employment, ILO, representatives of the State Governments and other stakeholders had participated to discuss the matter.


    This information was given by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Union Minister of State (I/C) for Labour and Employment in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
