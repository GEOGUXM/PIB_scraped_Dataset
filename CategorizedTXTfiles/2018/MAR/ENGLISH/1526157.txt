    National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has undertaken a review of all of its textbooks, which were developed as a follow-up of the National Curriculum Framework, 2005. In this regard, a web portal was created by the NCERT and suggestions from teachers were invited. Suggestions of approximately 700 teachers, which were found relevant for the review exercise, have been incorporated. NCERT has accordingly updated its textbooks for the year 2018-19. The review broadly pertained to rectification of factual errors, if any, and updation of data.


    
    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Shri Upendra Kushwaha today in a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question.
