    As and when a matter is referred to CBI for taking over the investigation of a State Government case, the feasibility of taking over investigation is examined keeping in view the various aspects of the cases including sensitivity of the case/inter-state or trans-national ramification.


    The Central Government as well as CBI takes various steps to fill-up all posts expeditiously. For upgradation of CBI which inter-alia include modernization, improvement in training, infrastructure, housing & improved condition of work, the Central Government has approved various schemes viz Modernization of training Centres in CBI, CBI e-governance, comprehensive modernization of CBI branches/offices, centralized technology vertical (CTV-CBI) and comprehensive modernization and purchase of land/construction office/Residence building for CBI etc.


    Further, CBI imparts training to its officers/employees in order to enhance their skills at its training centres and other training Institutions of repute.


    This was stated by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
