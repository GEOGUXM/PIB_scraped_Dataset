    The Government posts are regularly filled up in accordance with the recruitment rules. However, keeping in view the administrative exigency of work, efficiency and economy of operations and unavoidable circumstances, outsourcing through contract is also sometimes resorted to by the Ministries/Departments directly. However, such engagements can only be stop-gap arrangements. It is the responsibility of the Ministry/Department to fill up vacant posts on regular basis following due procedure.
