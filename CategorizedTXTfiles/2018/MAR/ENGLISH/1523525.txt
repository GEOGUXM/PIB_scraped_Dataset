      Replacement of Old Rail Tracks
      Posted On: 09 MAR 2018 5:22PM by PIB Delhi


    For the year 2017-18, a target of 3600 km in Complete Track Renewal (CTR) units has been kept for track renewal on Indian Railways. (One km of Through Rail Renewal is counted as 0.5 km CTR units and one km of Through Sleeper Renewal is counted as 0.5 km CTR units).


    Railway tracks are replaced through track renewal works which is an ongoing process. Track renewal works are undertaken as and when stretch of track becomes due for renewal on age/condition basis as per criteria laid down in Indian Railways Permanent Way Manual. If any stretch of track is not renewed in time due to various reasons, suitable speed restrictions, if required, are imposed to ensure safe running of trains.


    Details of track renewals are maintained Zonal Railway-wise and not State-wise. The targets fixed and actual progress of track renewal for these Zonal Railways for the last three year and current year are as under:
