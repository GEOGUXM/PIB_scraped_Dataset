    As on 01.03.2018, total of 98.1% of land required for Eastern and Western Dedicated Freight Corridors (except for the Sonanagar-Dankuni section) has been acquired. For acquisition of remaining land, all necessary process has been completed by Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL) and the matter has been taken up with concerned State authorities to expedite land acquisition.


    All Civil Engineering Contracts of Eastern Corridor have been awarded. All system contracts on Eastern Corridor have been awarded except for Khurja-Dadri, Khurja-Ludhiana, Durgawati-Karvandia sections. For these sections, tenders for system contracts have been invited.


    Some of the reasons for delay in execution of project are issues of land acquisition including Court Cases/arbitration, environment clearances, Law and order problems in few location etc.


    Steps taken to expedite progress include : -

      * Regular meeting held by DFCCIL, officials with land owners and Local State Authorities to resolve the pending issues.
      * Matter taken up with apex level of State Authorities by Ministry of Railways.
      * Pending issues taken up in the Project Monitoring Group (PMG) meetings.

    This information was made available in reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
