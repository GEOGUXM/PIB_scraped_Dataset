    The resettlement courses conducted by Directorate General of Resettlement (DGR) are either in the Central / State Government run institutions / institutions aligned to regulatory bodies of Government or are National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) compliant as stipulated by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC). These courses makes Ex-servicemen (ESM) suitable for employment, both in Government as well as private sector.


    Most diploma programmes are beyond 6 months duration unless specially tailored for DGR by Universities / National Council for Vocational Training. A pilot programme for diploma courses upto one year is planned for Financial Year 2018-19 to facilitate ESM to get government jobs.


    Matter has been taken up with Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship for amendment in the Recruitment Rules of different offices under Central / State Government, PSUs, Banks and Financial Institutions to ensure that certificates awarded for resettlement courses of below 6 months aligned to NSDC are recognized and given due weightage in recruitment for ESM.


    Placement assured training was planned on a pilot basis in the Financial Year 2015-16. However, the courses were not conducted as no service personnel had applied for the said courses.


    DGR has started conducting skill courses approved by NSDC with a placement clause from second half of Financial Year 2016-17.
