    Minister of State for Planning (IC) and Chemicals & Fertilizers, Shri Rao Inderjit Singh, in a written reply to a question by Kumari Selja on shortage of urea in the country and steps taken by Government to redress the hardships faced by the poor farmers, in Rajya Sabha today, informed that there is no shortage of urea in any part of the country.


    The Minister provided State-wise, requirement (demand), availability and sales of urea in the country. It can be seen from the statements that availability of urea was more than the sales and therefore there is no shortage, Shri Singh added.

    Further, Shri Singh informed that before the commencement of each cropping season, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), in consultation with all the State Governments, assesses the requirement of fertilizers. After assessment of requirement, DAC&FW projects month-wise requirement of fertilizers.


    On the basis of month-wise & state-wise projection given by DAC&FW, Department of Fertilizers allocates sufficient/ adequate quantities of fertilizers to States by issuing monthly supply plan and continuously monitors the availability through following system:


      * The movement of all major subsidized fertilizers is being monitored throughout the country by an on-line web based monitoring system called integrated Fertilizer Monitoring System (iFMS);

      * The State Governments are regularly advised to coordinate with manufacturers and importers of fertilizers for streamlining the supplies through timely placement of indents for railway rakes through their state institutional agencies like Markfed etc.
      * Regular Weekly Video Conference is conducted jointly by Department of Agriculture & Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), Department of Fertilizers (DoF), and Ministry of Railways with State Agriculture Officials and corrective actions are taken to dispatch fertilizer as indicated by the State Governments.
      * The gap between demand (requirement) and production is met through imports. The import for the season is also finalised well in advance to ensure timely availability.

    Thus, with the steps as indicated above, Department of Fertilizers ensures adequate availability of fertilizers to the farmers. The availability of fertilizers is adequate in the country, the Minister informed.
