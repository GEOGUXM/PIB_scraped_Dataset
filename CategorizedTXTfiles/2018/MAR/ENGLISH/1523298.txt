    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, met survivors of human trafficking on the occasion of International Womenâ€™s Day at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (March 8, 2018). He also launched a skills training programme for the young survivors, organised by an NGO, Justice and Care.


    Speaking on the occasion, the President said that human trafficking is a social evil. It is not a common crime but a crime against humanity. The entire society must unite for its eradication. Awareness should be increased. People should also be encouraged to urge the survivors of human trafficking into the mainstream of society and help them overcome their problems. We need to create an appropriate eco-system for survivors.
