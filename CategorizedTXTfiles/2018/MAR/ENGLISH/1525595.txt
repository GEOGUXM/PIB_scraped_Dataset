      Posted On: 21 MAR 2018 5:23PM by PIB Delhi


    Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) is targeted for commissioning in phases by the year 2020. Eastern DFC connects the mineral and industrial belts of Eastern India with North India. Western DFC connects the ports on the western coast to the hinterland in Northern and North-Western India. The main objective underlying DFCs, is creation of an efficient, dedicated rail corridor for freight movement and thereby reduce the cost and improve the ease of logistics. DFC directly benefits the States coming on its alignment, namely Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra and other neighbouring States by facilitating creation of industrial corridors/clusters based on DFC.


    Improvement in the freight transportations are envisaged with commissioning of DFC are :


    (i) Improved connectivity to ports and industrial clusters.


    (ii) Adequate carrying capacity for freight trains.


    (iii) Increase in average speed of freight trains.


    (iv) Possibility of running scheduled freight trains with guaranteed transit time.


    This information was given by the Minister of State of Railways Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
