    The National Policy on Indian Systems of Medicine & Homoeopathy - 2002, envisages integration of AYUSH systems of medicine with the Healthcare Delivery System. Mainstreaming of AYUSH is one of the strategies in National Health Mission (NHM) which seeks to provide accessible, affordable and quality health care in order to improve the existing health care delivery system.


    Government of India has adopted a strategy of Co-location of AYUSH facilities at Primary Health Centres (PHCs), Community Health Centres (CHCs) and District Hospitals (DHs), thus enabling choice to the patients for different systems of medicine. The engagement of AYUSH Doctors / paramedics and their training is supported by the Department of Health & Family Welfare, while the support for AYUSH infrastructure, equipment / furniture and medicines are provided by Ministry of AYUSH under Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National AYUSH Mission (NAM).


    Further, under NAM, there is provision of AYUSH Wellness Centres including Yoga & Naturopathy which also envisage engagement of Yoga manpower.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) for AYUSH, Shri Shripad Yesso Naik in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
