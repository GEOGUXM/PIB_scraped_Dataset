    Under the scheme institutional care is provided through CCIs, as a rehabilitative measure. In these CCIs, children are provided age appropriate education either within the institution or outside in a formal education system through convergence with other schemes and programs of the Government or civil society. Under the non-institutional care component, support is extended for adoption, foster care and sponsorship. The State Governments/UT Administrations, as per Section 54 of the JJ Act, are required through regular inspection and monitoring to ensure that the institutions are run as per the provisions of the Act and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rule, 2016 framed there-under.
