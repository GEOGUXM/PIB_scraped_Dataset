    There are 3686 centrally protected monuments/sites under the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The conservation and maintenance of these monuments, including forts and temples, is done regularly as per the availability of resources. They are in a good state of preservation.


    Under the National Culture Fund (NCF) several PSUs, financial institution, etc. have come forward to provide funds for various amenities related works. Similarly, under Adopt a Heritage Scheme recently launched by Ministry of Tourism, Public and Private Sector companies have been invited to adopt a monument for providing visitor amenities and their maintenance.
