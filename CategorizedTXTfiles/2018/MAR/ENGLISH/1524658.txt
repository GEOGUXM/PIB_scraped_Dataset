    Inland Waterways Authority of India, IWAI, had invited separate tenders for ferry vessels, fairway development (dredging) and setting up of floating jetties to introduce water taxi services from Wazirabad to FatehpurJat on the 16 km stretch of Yamuna river (National Waterway-110) in the Delhi NCR region. The National Green Tribunal was approached for clearance regarding ecological and environmental aspects for plying of water taxi on river Yamuna. NGT referred the matter to a Principal Committee, which in its meeting on 05.05.2017, deliberated upon the ecological and environmental aspects for plying of water taxi on Yamuna. The Principal Committee had opined that the project proponent should relook at the proposal taking into account the environmental impact of the activities proposed in the drinking water reservoir and carry out the cost benefit analysis of the project taking into account the environmental costs and approach the Principal Committee for re-consideration of the proposal. NGT, Delhi has been duly informed about the recommendations of the Principal Committee. IWAI has appointed an agency to carry out the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA), Social Impact Assessment (SIA) study and cost benefit analysis of the Wazirabad to FatehpurJat stretch in river Yamuna.
