    Capital Acquisition of defence equipment is undertaken in accordance with the extant Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) which incorporates provisions to ensure the highest degree of probity, public accountability, impartiality and transparency in the procurement process. It envisages signing of an Integrity Pact between Government and bidders for all capital procurement / schemes of Rs.20 crore and above, as against the earlier requirement for such a Pact for schemes of over Rs.100 crore.


    Allegations of corruption are dealt with expeditiously as per provisions of DPP and guidelines on the subject, which include provision for taking action against vendors for vexatious or frivolous complaints.


    Modernisation of the Defence Forces is a continuous process based on threat perception, operational challenges, technological changes and available sources to keep the armed forces in state of readiness and remaining equipped with modern weapon system. During the last three years and in the current year (upto 31.01.2018), 192 contracts have been signed for capital procurement of defence equipment for armed forces.
