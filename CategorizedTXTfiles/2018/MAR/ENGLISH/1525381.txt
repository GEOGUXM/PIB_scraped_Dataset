      Posted On: 20 MAR 2018 5:05PM by PIB Delhi


    An Act of Parliament namely the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) {PoA} Act, 1989, was enacted to prevent atrocities against members of Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs). With an objective to deliver members of SCs and STs a greater justice, the PoA Act has been amended in January, 2016. With a view to prevent atrocities, Rule 3 of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995, specifies precautionary and preventive measures to be taken by the State Government.


    State Government/Union Territory Administrations which implement provision of the PoA Act are provided admissible Central assistance towards its effective implementation. A Committee under the Chairpersonship of Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment form time to time reviews implementation status of the PoA Act in States and Union Territories. Last meeting of the Committee was held on 30.01.2018.
