    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted with the Collectors of the four States of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, and Jammu and Kashmir. He reviewed the progress towards ODF (Open Defecation Free) targets in each of these States.


    The Prime Minister encouraged the States to share their views and experiences on the work they have done so far towards Swachh Bharat and sanitation goals. He emphasized that there could be no greater inspiration for completing this task, than the 150 th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. He said teams should be formed at the district level to monitor progress.


    He said that efforts should be made to convert this mission into a Jan-Andolan (Mass Movement). He said students and school children can play a key role in generating greater awareness in this regard.
