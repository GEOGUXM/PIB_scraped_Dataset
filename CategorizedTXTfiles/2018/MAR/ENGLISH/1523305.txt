    The National Eligibility Test (NET) for Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) and Eligibility for Assistant Professor has been conducted regularly, i.e., twice every year in the months of June/July and December/January. The conduct of UGC-NET had been outsourced to Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) from December, 2014 onwards. The NET examination that was to be conducted in July, 2017 was conducted by CBSE in November, 2017. CBSE has been requested to continue to conduct the UGC-NET examination as per the existing schedule (twice a year). Recently, the CBSE has notified the conduct of next UGC- NET on 8.07.2018.


    The University Grants Commission has informed that in its meeting held on 22.12.2017, a decision has been taken to extend the validity period of joining/registering for Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) by one year, i.e., from the earlier period of two years to three years from the date of issue of JRF Award Letter.


    This would become applicable from the UGC-NET to be held on 08.07.2018, which has been duly notified by CBSE in its Information Bulletin.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Dr. Satya Pal Singh today in a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question.
