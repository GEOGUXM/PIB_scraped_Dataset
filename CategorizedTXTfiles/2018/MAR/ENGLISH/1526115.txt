    In so far as three Central Government Hospitals i.e. Safdarjung Hospital, Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and Lady Hardinge Medical College & Associated Hospitals are concerned, no such irregularities and sub-standard purchase of medicines, injections and cannulas in these hospitals at exorbitant rates violating the established procedures and guidelines has been reported.


    However, following safeguards are in place to curb such malpractices by these hospitals:-
