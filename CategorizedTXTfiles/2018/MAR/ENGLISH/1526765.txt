      Problems in Cantonment Areas
      Posted On: 28 MAR 2018 3:36PM by PIB Delhi


    Reports and representations are received from time to time about difficulties faced by residents of Cantonment areas. These cover subjects such as closure of roads, delay in mutation of properties, renewal of leases, building bye-laws and provision of civic amenities. These matters are addressed on case to case basis as per extant rules and instructions.


    The Government provides financial assistance to Cantonment Boards in the form of general Grant-in-aid and Grants for creation of capital assets. These amounts together with their own internal revenue are utilised by the Cantonment Boards for providing civic amenities / welfare measures for civilians residing in Cantonment Areas. General Grant-in-aid of Rs.267.42 crore and Grant for creation of capital assets of Rs.62.43 crore has been provided for Cantonment Boards during the financial year 2017-2018.


    There is no such proposal. The problems are resolved on case to case basis as per extant rules and instructions.


    This information was given by Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to ShriRajendra Agrawalin Lok Sabha today.
