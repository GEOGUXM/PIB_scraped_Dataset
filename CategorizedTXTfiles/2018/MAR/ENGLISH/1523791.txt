    A comprehensive Ganga River Basin Management Plan (GRBMP) has been prepared by the consortium of Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) with the objectives of taking comprehensive measures for restoration of river Ganga in its basin.


    Based on this approach, District Ganga Committees constituted under the provisions of the River Ganga (Rejuvenation, Protection and Management) Authorities order, 2016 have to prepare plan for protection, control and abatement of pollution in River Ganga and its tributaries and their river bed abutting the specified District and which may be recommended by the State Governments, State Ganga Committees and NMCG for adoption and completion. 47 District Ganga Committees have accordingly been notified.


    Further, Hon’ble NGT in its order dated 15.12.2017 in the matter of O.A. No. 200 of

    2014- M.C. Mehta Vs. Union of India & Ors. has inter-alia directed that “area of 100 mtrs. from the edge of the river shall be treated as Prohibitory Zone while 100 mtrs. to 300 mtrs. Would be treated as Regulatory Zone and till the time the State notifies the restricted activities, there shall be no construction activity even in the Regulatory Zone.”


    Further, the State of Uttarakhand vide its G.O. No. 1995/V-2-2017-58(AA)/2014 has issued Regulatory Policy, guidelines and by laws for regulation of construction activities in the hilly areas on the banks of river Ganga above Rishikesh.


    This information was given by Union Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Dr. Satyapal Singh in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
