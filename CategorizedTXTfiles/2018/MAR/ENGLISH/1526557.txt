    NITI Aayog’s Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) today announced the signing of a Statement of Intent (SOI) with SAP to promote a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. As part of the SOI, SAP in 2018 will adopt 100 Atal Tinkering Laboratories (ATL) for five years to nurture the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) learning among secondary school children across India.


    Acknowledging the importance of such collaborations, Amitabh Kant, CEO of NITI Aayog, said, “India’s growth for the next few decades will depend on the innovations coming out of these tinkering labs. Tomorrow’s ideas come from students, who will disrupt industries and creative sectors with new technologies and processes which will thrust India into the leadership position for technological creativity and innovation. This is possible only through effective public-private partnership and we are delighted to have SAP partner with us on AIM to nurture the future talent of our country”. The program aims to enable students to learn advanced technology topics relevant to digital transformation and the Internet of Things, e.g. Design Thinking methodology, introduction to programming languages and experiential science learning.


    Ramanathan Ramanan, Mission Director, AIM, added, “Such partnerships are a win-win situation for AIM and its partners. This partnership shall help support and boost innovations from the ATLs. The support to Atal Incubators will catalyze adoption of the innovations to commercial scales, ensuring deployment of the innovations to the domestic and international markets quickly and efficiently.”


    SAP employee volunteers will coach and mentor students in advanced technology topics and the design lab of SAP Labs India, will provide trainings and allow students to gain hands-on experience with technology gadgets.


    NITI Aayog’s AIM envisions the creation of a collaborative ecosystem, where students, teachers, mentors and industry partners work to facilitate innovation, foster scientific temper and an entrepreneurial spirit in the children of today, who will go on to become successful contributors to nation-building tomorrow.

    The goal remains to expand the reach of ATLs to every district of our country and establish over 30,000 ATLs covering the length and breadth of India over next three years. AIM also ensures training of teachers and mentors and organized a pan-India training workshop “Unbox Tinkering” which lasted over 100 days and at 10 locations. 500+ teachers were trained and 100+ prototypes created by teachers from different streams of science, mathematics, history etc. Several other initiatives, including ‘ATL School of the Month Challenge’, Community Day are conducted frequently to engage the ATLs. The next edition of the Community Day on April 14, , on which children, parents and teachers of all schools near an ATL will be invited to come experience innovation first-hand.
