      Posted On: 28 MAR 2018 6:06PM by PIB Delhi


    During the last three years and the current year, the Government has accorded administrative approval and financial sanction for construction of twelve (12) nuclear power reactors - ten (10) indigenous 700 MW Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) to be set up in fleet mode & two (02) units of Light Water Reactors (LWRs) to be set up in cooperation with Russian Federation to enhance nuclear power capacity in the country. The details of these projects are given below:

Light Water Reactor (LWR) to be set up in cooperation with Russian Federation

    Presently, two public sector companies of the Department of Atomic Energy, - Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) and Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam Limited (BHAVINI) are involved in nuclear power generation.


    There is no proposal under consideration at present to allow private partnership in the nuclear power generation sector. The Atomic Energy Act, 1962 permits Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) in setting up of nuclear power plants as a junior equity partner of a Government company. At present companies in private sector in India are participating in a major way in setting up nuclear power plants through supply of components, equipments and works contracts.


    The total installed capacity from conventional energy sources (Excluding Renewable Energy Sources) in the country as on 28.02.2018 is 2,71,300 MW. Out of which private sector contributes about 89,540 MW. It is estimated that capacity of energy production from conventional sources likely to be added through private sector during March 2018 – March 2022 will be 3802 MW. The likely retirement of private sector plants during March 2018 – March 2022 is about 1,070 MW. Hence, the total capacity for energy production from private sector at the end of March 2022 is likely to be 92,272 MW from conventional energy sources.
