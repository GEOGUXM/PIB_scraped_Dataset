    The Centre has issued a second Advisory to the States asking them to promptly investigate the incidents of vandalism of statues in some parts of the country and arrest and prosecute the culprits. It comes in the wake of the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiâ€™s direction this morning to contain vandalism and sternly deal with the culprits.


    The Advisory asks the States to investigate such incidents promptly and culprits be booked accordingly. Besides calling for close and continuous monitoring of the situation, it has asked the States to take all possible measures to ensure that no such incident should be allowed to happen.


    The Advisory asks the States to make DMs and SSPs personally responsible for ensuring that the law and order situation remains firmly under control in their jurisdiction. Intensification of patrolling in sensitive locations, community policing for peace and harmony, check on anti-social elements and preventive measures wherever required are the main elements of the Advisory.
