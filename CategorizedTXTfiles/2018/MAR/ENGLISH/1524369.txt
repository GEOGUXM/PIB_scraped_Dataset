    The following measures have been taken by the Government to check ceasefire violations/ cross border firings and to ensure safety and security of people living at the Indo-Pak border:


    (i) All the forward posts are adequately strengthened to withstand enemy fire. Besides there are well-established Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to safeguard against enemy action to minimize own casualties.


    (ii) Immediate and effective retaliation by Indian Army and BSF Personnel is carried out during instances of unprovoked fire and ceasefire violations. In addition, all violations of ceasefire are taken up with Pakistan authorities at the appropriate levels, through the established mechanism of hotlines, flag meetings as well as talks between the Directorate Generals of Military Operations of the two countries. Written protest is also lodged for every incidents of Cross Border Firing.


    (iii) BSF regularly interacts with border population situated close to border and educates them not to move in vicinity of areas prone to unprovoked fire without prior information / permission of BSF. Efforts are also made to inform the villagers on occurrence of cross-border firing.


    (iv) Government has sanctioned construction of 14,460 bunkers, to mitigate the hardships being faced by people living on IB/LC, due to Cross Border Firing.


    (v) Diplomatically, India has repeatedly emphasized, including at the highest level, the need for Pakistan to uphold the sanctity of the Line of Control (LC) and abide by the ceasefire commitments along the International Border and LC.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
