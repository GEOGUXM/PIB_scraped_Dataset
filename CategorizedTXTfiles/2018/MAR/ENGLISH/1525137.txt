    The Ministry of Tourism promotes India as a holistic destination catering to all segments of tourists including budget travellers both in the international as well as domestic markets.


    The Ministry of Tourism under a voluntary scheme approves Homestays/Bed & Breakfast establishments and Guest Houses as per Guidelines to provide standardized services and facilities which primarily cater to the budget tourists. Additionally, the Ministry of Tourism also classifies/re-classifies hotels in various star categories which cater to tourists of various budget segments. The guidelines of the Ministry of Tourism for approval/classification/re-classification of operational hotels stipulate that hotels of 1, 2, 3 and 4 star categories availing subsidy/tax benefits/other benefits from the Central/State Government would be subject to a lock-in period of 8 years so that these hotels continue to serve as budget category hotels.


    The Ministry of Tourism has launched the ‘Swadesh Darshan Scheme’ for integrated development of theme based tourist circuits and the ‘National Mission on Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual, Heritage Augmentation Drive’ (PRASHAD) Scheme to beautify and improve amenities and infrastructure at pilgrimage sites to cater to religious, mass and niche tourism in a holistic manner. The Domestic Tourist Visits (DTVs) from 2014 to 2016 are:
