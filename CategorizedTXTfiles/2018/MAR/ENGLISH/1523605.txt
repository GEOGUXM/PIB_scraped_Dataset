    Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has said the civil society and NGOs have a vital role to play in development of the country. Addressing a function in NOIDA today, he said for a developed India we need to work together. Shri Rajnath Singh said he has witnessed NGOs working in remote inaccessible parts of LWE-affected regions where even the local administration finds it difficult to reach.


    Shri Rajnath Singh said the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has directed focus on the development of 115 aspirational districts which are lowly ranked on the development index.


    The Union Home Minister said while India ranks 8th in the world in terms of GDP and third by Purchasing Power Parity, sadly we are placed a lowly 131 out of 188 countries in the Human Development Index. To fulfil Prime Minister's Vision India 2022, Shri Rajnath Singh said we need not only a high GDP but also a high Gross Domestic Prosperity index.
