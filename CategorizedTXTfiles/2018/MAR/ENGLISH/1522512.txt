    The steps taken/being taken by DRDO to ensure that the discontinuation and cancellation of projects are taken at an early stage are:

                                                                                        
•  More stringent review mechanisms including tracking of timely completion of reviews. 
                                                                                        
                                                                                        
                                                                                        
•  Involvement of Services & production partners during development process and reviews.
