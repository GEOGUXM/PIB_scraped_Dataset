    National Artistes Welfare Fund and Artistes Pension Scheme and Welfare Fund were ingredients of a single Scheme titled “Artistes Pension Scheme and Welfare” being administered by Ministry of Culture.


    Subsequent to review of the Scheme beyond 12 th Five Year Plan in 2017 the nomenclature of the Scheme has been modified as “Scheme for Pension and Medical Aid to Artistes”. The purpose of the scheme is to improve financial and socio-economic status of the old artistes and scholars who have contributed significantly in their specialized fields of arts, letters etc. in their active age or are still contributing in the field of arts, letters etc. but due to old age they have to lead a miserable life or are in penury condition. Under the scheme, financial assistance from the Government is provided in the form of monthly allowance to the artistes recommended under the Centre-State Quota on sharing basis, with the latter paying a monthly allowance of at least Rs.500/- per month per beneficiary. The monthly allowance contributed by the Central Government in such cases shall not exceed Rs.3500/- per month per beneficiary. In any circumstances the contribution of Central Government and State Government/UT Administration altogether will not exceed Rs.4000/- per month per beneficiary. The Scheme has also provision to provide medical aid facility to these Artistes and his/her spouse by covering them under a convenient and affordable health insurance scheme of the Government.


    Totalof Rs.52.54 Crore has been released by the Government under the erstwhile “Artistes Pension Scheme and Welfare Fund” from 2014-15 to 2016-17.
