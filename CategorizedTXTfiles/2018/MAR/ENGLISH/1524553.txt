    The Government of India is in the process of formulating a Scheme ‘Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (KUSUM) ’ which, inter alia, provides for:


    (i) installation of grid-connected solar power plants each of capacity up to 2 MW in the rural areas;


    (ii) installation of standalone off-grid solar water pumps to fulfill irrigation needs of farmers not connected to grid;


    (iii) solarization of existing grid-connected agriculture pumps to make farmers independent of grid supply and also enable them to sell surplus solar power generated to DISCOM and get extra income ; and


    (iv) solarization of tube-wells and lift irrigation projects of Government sector.


    The details on funds and mode of implementation will be decided on approval of the Scheme.
