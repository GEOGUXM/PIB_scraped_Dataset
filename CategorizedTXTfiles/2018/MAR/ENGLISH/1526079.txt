    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:


         1. Crude oil production by ONGC during February, 2018 was 1684.47 TMT which is 5.70% lower than the monthly target and 3.27% lower when compared with February, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-February, 2017-18 was 20369.95 TMT which is 3.27% lower than target for the period but 0.41% higher than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production with respect to target are as under:

     2. Additional production planned from WO16 cluster from Oct’17 onwards could not be realized due to delay in implementation of “Conversion of Sagar Samrat to MOPU” Project.
     3. Production planned from project ‘Integrated Development of B 127 Cluster’ from Oct’2017 onwards could not be realized due to delay in implementation of project. Production targeted by pre-monsoon of 2018 from B-127 wells.
     4. Increase in water cut in wells of Heera, Neelam and B-173 fields.
     5. Frequent power shutdowns and low gas injection pressure in Mehsana and Assam hampered artificial lift operations.
     6. Increase in water cut in Mehsana and Assam.

         1. Crude oil production by OIL during February, 2018 was 260.49 TMT which is 9.08% lower than monthly target but marginally higher by 0.06% than production in February, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-February, 2017-18 was 3094.31 TMT which is 9.43% lower than target for the period but 4.37% higher than production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


     1. Less than planned contribution from old wells – Rise in water cut in wells and decline in total liquid production of wells of Greater Hapjan and Greater Chandmari Fields.

     2. Less than planned contribution from work over wells.

         1. Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during February, 2018 was 786.53 TMT which is 3.56% lower than the monthly target and 1.14% lower than February, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-February, 2017-18 was 9177.98 TMT which is 5.65% lower than target for the period and 5.05% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


     1. RJ-ON-90/1 (CIL): Around 80 oil wells closed due to various reasons like high water cut, requiring WOJ, etc. No production from Guda in Feb’18 due to non-availability of tankers. Underperformance of Bhagyam.

     2. Panna-Mukta (Shell): Well PC-10 underperforming after shutdown.
     3. CY-ONN-2002/2 (ONGC): Full fledged production yet to be realized owing to non-grant of PML.

    Natural Gas

     1. Natural gas production during February, 2018 was 2484.10 MMSCM which is 12.28% lower than the target for the month and 1.52% lower when compared with February, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production during April-February, 2017-18 was 29866.69 MMSCM which is 6.68% lower than target for the period but 2.47% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II . Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of February, 2018 and cumulatively for the period April-February, 2017-18 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

    Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production


         1. Natural gas production by ONGC during February, 2018 was 1800.02 MMSCM which is 8.87% lower than the monthly target but 1.52% higher when compared with February, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC during April-February, 2017-18 was 21415.86 MMSCM which is 2.67% lower than the cumulative target but 6.46% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year. Reasons for shortfall in production during month are as under:


     1. Less gas production from WO16 cluster and no production from B127 Cluster due to delay in implementation of ‘Conversion of Sagar Samrat to MOPU’ and ‘Integrated Development of B-127 Cluster’ project respectively.

     2. Delay in commencement of production planned from sub-sea wells in Eastern Offshore. All 3 wells of VA S1 project completed and hooked up by Feb’18 against plan of Jan’18. Commissioning activities for onshore terminal is in progress.

         1. Natural gas production by OIL during February, 2018 was 209.33 MMSCM which is 14.56% lower than the monthly target and 7.04% lower than February, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-February, 2017-18 was 2644.77 MMSCM which is 3.09% lower than the cumulative target and 1.52% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


     1. Outage of three high producing gas wells of Deohal and Naholia area due to surface facility modification jobs.

     2. Shutdown of LTPS from 3 rd to 12 th Feb’18 for carrying out hydro test and maintenance works of the gas supply line. NRL plant shutdown due to sudden outage of Hydrogen unit during 10 th to 13 th Feb’18. Loading problem of BCPL’s Madhuban Compressor.

         1. Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during February, 2018 was 474.75 MMSCM which is 22.37% lower than the monthly target and 9.44% lower when compared with February, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-February, 2017-18 was 5806.06 MMSCM which is 19.9% lower than the cumulative target and 8.5% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


     1. KG- OSN-2001/3 (GSPC): Underperformance of wells.

     2. KG-DWN-98/3 (RIL): Well A20 ceased on 18.02.2018 due to low reservoir pressure.
     3. Raniganj East (Essar): Few wells closed for planned maintenance and refrac jobs. Major customer 'Matix' under operational shutdown.

     1. Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)


    Refinery production during February, 2018 was 20086.12 TMT which is 0.21% higher than the target for the month and 5.44% higher when compared with February, 2017. Cumulative production during April-February, 2017-18 was 230819.76 TMT which is 3.07% higher than the target for the period and 3.02% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III . Company-wise production for the month of February, 2018 and cumulatively for the period April-February, 2017-18 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

    Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production


         1. CPSE Refineries’ production during February, 2018 was 11492.24 TMT which is 0.74% lower than the target for the month and 7.14% higher when compared with February, 2017. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-February, 2017-18 was 132712.60 TMT which is 4.10% higher than the target for the period and 5.96% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


     1. IOCL, Barauni: Lower due to Naphtha containment.

     2. IOCL, Paradip: Lower Hydrogen availability.
     3. MRPL, Mangalore: Reduction in Phase -2 CDU throughputs to accommodate upgradation of one the desalters in the unit and unit trip & forced maintenance of heat exchangers in Phase-1 CDU due to flange leak.

    3.2 Production in JV refineries during February, 2018 was 1446.24 TMT which is 5.03% higher than the target for the month and 9.91% higher when compared with February, 2017. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-February, 2017-18 was 14004.05 TMT which is 1.97% higher than the target for the period but 9.85% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. The major reason for shortfall in production was outage of refinery Hydrocracker unit for maintenance jobs in BORL Bina refinery.


    3.3 Production in private refineries during February, 2018 was 7147.63 TMT which is higher by 0.81% than the target for the month and 2% higher when compared with February, 2017. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-February, 2017-18 was 84103.11 TMT which is 1.65% higher than the target for the period and marginally higher by 1% than the production during corresponding period of last year.


    3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of February, 2018 and cumulatively for the period April-February, 2017-18 vis-à-vis April-February, 2016-17 are given at Annexures - IV and V respectively.
