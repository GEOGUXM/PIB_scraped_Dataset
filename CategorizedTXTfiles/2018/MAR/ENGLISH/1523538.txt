      Posted On: 09 MAR 2018 5:55PM by PIB Delhi


    As per Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), the total number of lives covered under any type of health insurance policy as on 31 st March, 2017 were 43.75 crore which is approximately 36 per cent of Indiaâ€™s population as per Census 2011.


    Health Insurance Policies generally provide coverage for inpatient treatment including Domiciliary Hospitalization benefits subject to policy terms and conditions. However, more number of health insurance products now provide coverage for Out Patient Department (OPD) treatment in order to encourage policyholders to go for treatment at early stages. IRDAI (Health Insurance) Regulations, 2016 inter-alia enable the insurers to introduce wellness and preventive features as part of health insurance policies. During the year 2016-17, the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) was in implementation in 15 States/UTs involving 265 districts, covering 3.63 crore families. Some of the insurance products where OPD treatment and maternity cover are being covered is at Annexure.
