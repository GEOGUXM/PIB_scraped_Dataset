    According to an article “Global surveillance of trends in cancer survival 2000-14 (CONCORD-3), published in LANCET, there are differences in survival rates across countries. The study estimates 5-year survival for breast cancer as 88.2% in Canada, 68.78% in Thailand, 76.5 % in Poland and 66.1% in India.


    However, the coverage of Population in the study is reported to vary from higher coverage in European Countries while it is reported to cover about 0.1 % of population in India. The study has indicated various reasons for variations in survival rate of cancer. The study also impress upon the need of Population Based Cancer Registries (PBCRs) to evaluate both the impact of cancer prevention strategies and the effectiveness of health systems for all patients diagnosed with cancer.


    The cancer survival rate is generally believed to depend upon amongst others, stage at diagnosis, stage of initiation of treatment, type and site of cancer, correct and complete treatment. Cancer can be diagnosed and treated at various levels in the Health care system.


    National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (NCDIR), an institute under Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is implementing National Cancer Registry Program. As reported by ICMR, estimated incidence and mortality for three years is given belowrespectively:
