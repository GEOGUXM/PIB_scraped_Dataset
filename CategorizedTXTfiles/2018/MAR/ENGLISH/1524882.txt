On domestic front, it observed that the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) expanded for the sixth consecutive month in January 2018 led by new orders. Assessment of overall business sentiment in the Indian manufacturing sector improved in Q3 as reflected in its Industrial Outlook Survey.
