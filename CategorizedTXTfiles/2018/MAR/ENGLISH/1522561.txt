      Decline in Child Labour
      Posted On: 05 MAR 2018 5:28PM by PIB Delhi


    As per 2011 Census, the number of main workers in the age group of 5-14 years in the country is 43.53 lakh which shows a decline from 57.79 lakh as per 2001 Census.


    As per the data received from States/UTs the number of prosecution launched under Child & Adolescent Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986 during the last three years, year wise and state wise is given at Annexure.


    After strengthening the legislative framework through amendment in Child Labour Act, Government has framed the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2017 on 2.6.2017 which ensures effective enforcement of the provisions of the Act. To provide an enforcement mechanism an online portal PENCIL (Platform for Effective Enforcement of No Child Labour) has been launched by the Ministry of Labour & Employment on 26.9.2017. Ministry has also framed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) as a ready recknor for enforcing agencies and other stakeholders.


    Under project based action plan Government is implementing the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme for rehabilitation of child labour. Government is also running various awareness generation campaigns for eradication of child labour under the Scheme.
