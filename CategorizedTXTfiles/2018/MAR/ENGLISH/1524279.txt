    The Ministry of Minority Affairs implements various schemes for pursuing higher research and institutions of National importance for minority students, though there is no specific skill scheme for minority youth to facilitate their entry into the areas of higher research and institutions of national importance.


    The Merit-cum-Means Scholarship Scheme is awarded for pursuing professional and technical courses, at under-graduate and post-graduate levels, in institutions recognized by the appropriate authority. Under the scheme, 30% of these scholarships are earmarked for girl students. To be eligible, students should not have annual family income more than Rs.2.50 lakh and he/she should have secured minimum 50% marks in previous class. Similarly, the objective of the Maulana Azad National Fellowship is to provide integrated five year fellowships in the form of financial assistance to students from minority communities to pursue higher studies such as M.Phil and Ph.D. To be eligible, the annual income of the family from all sources should not exceed Rs.2.50 lakh. Thirty per cent of the fellowships are earmarked for eligible girl students. The scheme is being implemented through University Grants Commission (UGC) in Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode. The details of schemes/guidelines and achievements are available on the website of this Ministry (www.minorityaffairs.gov.in).
