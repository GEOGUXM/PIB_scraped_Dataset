    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind in his message on the eve of Easter has said: -


    “On the auspicious occasion of Easter, I extend my greetings and best wishes to all my fellow citizens, especially to members of the Christian community in India and abroad.


    Easter, the sacred day of the resurrection of Lord Jesus, brings joy and equanimity to our hearts. May the teachings of Christ guide us to the essential commonalities among various religions – and may they promote peace and fraternity.


    I am confident that this festival will instill in us a sense of unity and reinforce commitment to the well-being and prosperity of our nation and shared society”.
