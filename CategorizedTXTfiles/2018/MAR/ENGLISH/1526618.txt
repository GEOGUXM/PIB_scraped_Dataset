    Government has setup National Academic Depository (NAD) which is a 24x7 online store house of academic awards digitally lodged by various academic institutions/school boards/eligibility assessment bodies. The University Grants Commission (UGC) has been designated as authorized body to operationalise NAD. The academic awards to be lodged on NAD cover degrees, diplomas, certificates, mark-sheets including awards issued for skill development. The framework of NAD includes various Central Universities, Central Higher Educational Institutions, State Universities, Deemed to be universities, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), State School Education Boards etc. located in various States/Union Territories including the State of Maharashtra. NAD comprises of two interoperable digital depositories viz., NSDL Database Management Limited (NDML) and CDSL Ventures Limited (CVL). Maintenance of academic awards in a digital depository not only enables online access, retrieval and verification of these awards, but also helps eliminating fraudulent practices such as forging of certificates and mark-sheets etc.

      * Students can get digital documents such as Mark Sheet , Pass Certificates and Migration Certificates of CBSE examination through Digi Locker.
