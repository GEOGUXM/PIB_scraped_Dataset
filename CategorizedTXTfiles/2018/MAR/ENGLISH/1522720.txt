    The Government also provides additional allowances/incentives to CAPF personnel deployed in such operations which include Risk Allowance, retention of Government accommodation at the last place of posting and HRA as admissible at the last place of posting.


    The Government has a multi-pronged strategy to deal with Left Wing Extremism. This strategy is centered around security related measures, developmental interventions and ensuring rights & entitlements of local communities etc. Security related measures include assistance to LWE affected States by providing CAPF Bns, helicopters, UAVs, training assistance, construction of fortified police stations, funds for modernization of State Police Forces, arms & equipment, sharing of intelligence etc. On the development side, apart from flagship schemes of the Central Government in infrastructure, education, health, skill development, agriculture etc. several initiatives have been taken specifically for development of LWE affected areas. These include focused schemes for development of roads, installation of mobile towers, skill development, improving network of banks and post offices, health and education facilities, particularly in the 35 worst affected districts.


    Recently the Government has approved the Special Central Assistance Scheme which envisages an outlay of Rs 1000 Cr per annum for three years for the 35 worst affected LWE districts to cover gaps in critical infrastructure and services. In addition, the Special Infrastructure Scheme has also been revived for providing support to the States for strengthening the Special Forces and SIBs and also for construction of additional fortified police stations. The Security Related Expenditure Scheme has also been extended with increased allocation and new features up to 2020.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.
