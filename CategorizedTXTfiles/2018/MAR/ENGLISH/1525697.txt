    New Interventions:


    a. Two schemes of the UGC i.e. 'Universities with Potential for Excellence' (UPE) and 'Colleges with Potential for Excellence' (CPE) subsumed as the components of 'Enhancing Quality and Excellence in select State Universities' and 'Enhancing Quality and Excellence in Autonomous Colleges'. These targeted interventions in well performing State Public Universities and Autonomous Colleges are meant to bring about significant quality enhancement and improvement in teaching and research.


    b. Component on Research and Innovation will focus on fostering innovation, entrepreneurship and employability by creation of 20 Research Clusters in the States. These will be on competitive and challenge mode and will largely emerge from Universities in collaboration with the National Laboratories under D/o Science & Technology/D/o Bio-Technology and industry,


    c. The scheme will give priority to the Aspirational Districts, identified by the NITI Aayog. The purpose of such an intervention is to improve access and equity through improved enrolment and retention


    d. Creation of National Higher Education Resource Centre (NHERC) to be a resource centre for Research, Policy Advocacy, Capacity Building and providing well-informed policy and evidence based research inputs


    e. Components of Institutional Reforms and Restructuring, Capacity Building and Management Information Systems have been merged into one single component 'Institutional Restructuring, Capacity Building and Reforms'.


    f. With a view to ensure greater resource flow to the State Higher Education sector, RUSA 2.0 will encourage States and Institutions to undertake projects in a public-private partnership mode based on viability gap funding. These States would be encouraged to create facilitating mechanisms to ease restrictions for enhancing private investment in the sector.


    g. An online virtual platform of infrastructure and equipment (inventory) will be created so that institutions can share these resources.
