    The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 under Section 19 provides for norms and standards for a school. The appropriate Governments have the responsibility and mandate to provide school infrastructure including toilets in schools as per the RTE norms. All States and UTs have been advised to comply with the provision of the RTE Act, 2009 which inter alia states that every school building should have separate toilets for boys and girls. Construction of toilets in schools across the country to ensure adequate number of toilets as per student strength in the school or upgradation of schools is a continuous process.


    The Ministry supports States and Union Territories (UTs) for creation and augmentation of infrastructure facilities including toilet facilities in schools across the country at elementary level through Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and at secondary level through Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA). Ministry of Human Resource Development annually approves Work Plan & Budget of the States and UTs for various activities including drinking water and toilet facilities under SSA and RMSA schemes based on the gap determined by Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) database and proposals received from States/UTs.

Under RMSA since inception of scheme in 2009-10 till 28.02.2018, 70,244 toilets in secondary schools have been sanctioned, out of which States/UTs have reported construction of 49,636 toilets.

    States/UTs are advised regularly in various meetings and workshops to complete the works in a time-bound manner.


    A total amount of Rs. 1062.27 crore under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Rs. 60.48 crore under RMSA has been allocated during the years 2014 and 2015 to States and UTs specifically for construction and repair of toilets under Swachh Vidyalaya initiative aimed to provide separate toilets for girls and boys in all Government schools.
