    The Government is taking various steps to check evasion as well as educate the taxpayers about the new tax regime and encouraging voluntary compliance. The steps which are being taken include introduction of e-way bill, simplification of measures for filing tax returns, steps to capture invoice details of transactions so that the same could be matched with credit taken and verification of transition credit availed by tax payers.


    This was stated by Shri Ship Pratap Shukla, Minister of State for Finance in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
