      Mission on Moon and Mars
      Posted On: 28 MAR 2018 3:45PM by PIB Delhi


    Chandrayaan-2 is a totally indigenous mission with Orbiter, Lander and rover configuration. Orbiter is to be placed in 100 km orbit around the Moon. After reaching the 100 km lunar orbit, the Lander will be separated from the orbiter and it will soft land on the lunar surface and deploy a Rover. The Rover will then move around the landing site. The Orbiter will continue to orbit around the Moon and perform remote-sensing observations of the lunar surface.


    ISRO has formed a study team to formulate plans to explore solar system bodies. The study team has recommended a future mission to Mars. Scientific proposals for payloads are selected by an expert committee.


    The Orbiter will study the Moon for its topography, elemental and mineralogical distribution and extent of subsurface water ice. The lander will land on the lunar surface and demonstrate ISROâ€™s capability for landing on Moon. Subsequently, the Rover will roll out of the Lander and move around the landing site. The lander and rover payloads will conduct observations on the elemental composition and study the lunar ionosphere. The Chandrayaan-2 mission will definitely expand the scientific knowledge on Moon by remote-sensing from Orbiter and in-situ studies from lander/rover. Total expenditure on the mission is around Rs 800 Cr.


    Mission planning for next MARS mission is under progress.
