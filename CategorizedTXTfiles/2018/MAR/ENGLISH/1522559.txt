      Posted On: 05 MAR 2018 5:27PM by PIB Delhi


    Statistics of workers in the unorganised sector is not maintained centrally. Section 10 of the Unorganised Workers Social Security Act, 2008 provides that every unorganised worker shall be eligible for registration subject to the fulfilment of the conditions that he or she shall have completed fourteen years of age; and a self-declaration by him or her confirming that he or she is an unorganised worker. The application for registration is to be made to the District Administration.


    A proposal to create a national platform to facilitate issue of a Unique ID i.e. Unorganised Workers Identification Number (UWIN) has been approved by the Central Government with an estimated cost of Rs.402.7 crores to be implemented in two years during 2017-18 and 2018-19.


    Government has taken steps to cover workers in the Unorganised Sector under the Social Security which includes the following:-

     1. Converged Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana/Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana in which premium is shared between Centre and the States in 50:50 ratio.
     2. National Health Projection Scheme
     3. National Family Benefit Scheme
     4. Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme

    This information was given by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar Union Minister of State (I/C) for Labour and Employment in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
