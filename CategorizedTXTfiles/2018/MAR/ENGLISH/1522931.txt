      Posted On: 07 MAR 2018 3:09PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government has established a robust maritime search and rescue framework to address and respond various contingencies in deep sea and in coastal areas of India, which includes distress onboard fishing boats and merchant vessels, safety of life during marine incidents and SAR response during Cyclones etc. Director General Indian Coast Guard has been designated as the Chairman of National Maritime Search and Rescue Board (NMSARB), which constitutes members from national / coastal state administration / agencies. The sanctioned strength of Coast Guard has increased from 7,096 in 2008 to 14,500 (as on February, 2018). At present, the average intake of manpower in ICG is 130 officers and 720 Enrolled Personnel per year, which is almost a 100% increase from manpower recruited in 2008.


    A Coast Guard station at a particular location is set up taking into consideration the threat perception, vulnerability gap analysis and presence of other maritime organization / security set up in the vicinity.


    Alappuzha is located in close proximity of Coast Guard Station Kochi and Coast Guard Station Vizhinjam and regular air surveillance is also undertaken by the Coast Guard Air Enclave at Kochi. These Coast Guard stations are equipped to quickly respond to any urgent emerging situation at sea.


    This information was given by Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri KC Venugopal in Lok Sabha today.
