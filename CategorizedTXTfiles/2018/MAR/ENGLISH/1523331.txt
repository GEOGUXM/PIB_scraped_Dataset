      Plant Level Viability Test of Monazite resources
      Posted On: 08 MAR 2018 5:46PM by PIB Delhi


    It is premature to conduct plant level viability tests of the monazite resources found in the Vishakhapatnam district, as Indian Rare Earths Limited (IREL), a Public Sector Undertaking under Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), has not yet obtained Mining Lease in the Donkuru-Baruva deposit under the provisions of Atomic Minerals Concession Rules-2016. In view of this position, as of now there is no proposal to exploit the monazite from Vishakhapatnam district in Nuclear Reactors.


    This was stated by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
