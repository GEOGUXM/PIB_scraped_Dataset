      Posted On: 23 MAR 2018 5:55PM by PIB Delhi


    Manual Survey and inventorization is practiced widely to identify the location of Medicinal Plants in India, however, the modern technologies like Remote Sensing & Geographic Information System (GIS), Global Positioning System (GPS) used for survey and inventorization of Plant diversity and identification of specific location/habitat of plant species / populations are also currently used to identifying the location of the medicinal plants.


    Recently, the NMPB, Ministry AYUSH under its Central Sector Scheme on Conservation, Development and Sustainable Management of Medicinal Plants has supported a project titled “Geospatial approach for suitable site identification for conservation of some species of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (MAPs) at selected districts of Uttarakhand” to Uttrakhand Space Application Centre, Dehradun and another project titled “Inventorization, Digitization and web enabling of the Geo-spatial Maps of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants cultivated in the States of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Orissa” to the Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP), Lucknow.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) for AYUSH, Shri Shripad Yesso Naik in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
