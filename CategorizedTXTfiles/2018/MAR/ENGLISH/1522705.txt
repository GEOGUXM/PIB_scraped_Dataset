    The Homoeopathy is not a pseudoscience. The conclusion of most comprehensive systematic reviews of studies based on classical homoeopathy has concluded that it has a positive and specific effect greater than placebo alone. Four systematic review/meta-analyses of homeopathy for all conditions have been published in international peer reviewed journals. Of these, 03 covering hundreds of clinical trials reached a positive conclusion that there is evidence that homeopathy is clinically effective. Review of basic research on highly diluted homeopathic medicines found 98 replicated experiments, over 70% of replications were positive.


    Homeopathy is being promoted as it is not only safe and effective but also due to its high acceptance through high quality surveys of use of homeopathy. In India, at 23 Institutes/Unit under Central Council for Research in Homeopathy (CCRH), there is 50% more footfall of patients seeking homoeopathic treatment during the last five years.


    There is evidence that homoeopathy is beneficial and not merely a placebo. ‘Scientific Framework of Homoeopathy- Evidence Based Homeopathy’ consists of research worldwide and ‘Homoeopathy -Science of Gentle healing’ focused to Research in India has enlisted hundreds of scientific trials including basic research showing strong evidence towards the beneficial role of homoeopathy.


    There is evidence based data (not anecdotal) with CCRH that warrants the promotion or acceptance of homoeopathy in India.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) for AYUSH, Shri Shripad Yesso Naik in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
