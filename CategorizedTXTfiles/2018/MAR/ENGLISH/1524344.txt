      Posted On: 14 MAR 2018 5:15PM by PIB Delhi


    Keeping in view the Governmentâ€™s directive to promote digital transactions and to facilitate passengers to make payments using credit/debit cards, Indian Railways have tied up with State Bank of India to install 10,000 Point of Sale (POS) machines at various locations of Indian Railways i.e. Passenger Reservation System (PRS)/ Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS) ticket booking counters and Parcel/Goods locations.


    The cashless transaction in the case of freight business is more than 99%. As far as passenger business is concerned, during the period April, 2017 to February, 2018 approximately 66% of total reserved tickets were booked through cashless modes of payment through internet or through credit/debit cards across counters and approximately 70% of revenue has been received through cashless modes of payment in respect of reserved passenger segment.


    This information was given by the Minister of State of Railways Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
