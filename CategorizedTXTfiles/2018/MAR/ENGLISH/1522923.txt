    Government of India has set an ambitious target of 175 GW from Renewable energy sources (RES) by 2022, which comprises of 100 GW Solar, 60GW from Wind, 10 GW from Biomass and 5 GW from Small Hydro. However, as per the Generation Planning studies carried out by Central Electricity Authority (CEA) for the year2021-22, with 175 GW of RES, it has been found that coal-based power plant will play a dominant role in Indian Power Sector. The energy contribution from coal-based power plants is likely to increase to1072 BU by 2021-22. As such, there will be no serious effect on coal based thermal power plants.
