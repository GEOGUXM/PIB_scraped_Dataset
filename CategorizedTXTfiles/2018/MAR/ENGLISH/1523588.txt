    As reported by the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA), a total number of 3210 children were placed in In-country Adoption during the year 2016-2017. Adoption Policy has been simplified through the Adoption Regulations, 2017. These Regulations have been made keeping in mind the best interests of the child and streamlining the adoption process further as well as for bringing greater transparency in the adoption system. The entire process has been streamlined and made transparent with fully automated online system with central database.


    CARA through CARINGS has further simplified adoption process and has brought in greater transparency through e-governance, where all stakeholders including the Prospective Adoptive Parents (PAPs) can monitor the status and progress of their case. The Prospective Adoptive Parents (PAPs) are directly registering on CARINGS w.e.f. 1st August, 2015. All the stakeholders viz - Specialised Adoption Agencies (SAAs), Authorised Foreign Adoption Agencies (AFAAs), State Adoptions Resource Agencies (SARAs), District Child Protection Units (DCPUs), NOC Committee and Foreign Regional Registration Office (FRRO) are utilizing this common online application which acts as Central Registry for Adoption under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.


    The Guidelines Governing Adoption of Children, 2015 has been replaced by the Adoption Regulations, 2017. This has been framed by the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) and notified by the Government of India under Section 68(c) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 on 4 th January, 2017 under Section 2(3) of the said Act and has come to force in the country w.e.f. 16 th January, 2017. One of the key features of the new regulations is that time-lines have been stipulated for each process and the responsibilities of different agencies have been fixed.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Women and Child Development,


    Dr. Virendra Kumar, in reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
