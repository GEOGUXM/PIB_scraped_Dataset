    The histories of operations conducted by the Indian Armed Forces are compiled on the basis of official records. Hence, there is hardly any gap in knowledge base of contemporary military history and war studies in India compared to advances made at global level.


    The Government recognises the need to re-examine the capture and recording of historical events related to military operations and war records to ensure a higher order of professionalism in the services.


    The History Division, Ministry of Defence, is entrusted with the responsibility of undertaking the research and compilation of various military operations conducted by the Indian Armed Forces from time to time. Further, to promote the study of military history in the Indian Universities, the Ministry of Defence also provides two research fellowships to the researchers working on the subject related to military history. Occasionally, the History Cells of the three Services also write / sponsor the projects relating to their service.


    This information was given by Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Smt Poonam Mahajan in Lok Sabha today.
