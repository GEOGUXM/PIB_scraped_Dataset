    The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare is administering a Centrally Sponsored Scheme to establish new medical colleges attached with existing District/Referral Hospitals in underserved areas of the country. Under Phase – I of the Scheme, 58 districts in 20 States/UT have been selected. Out of these, 56 colleges have been approved and a sum of Rs.5188.42 crore has been released to the States/UT. 8 colleges under Phase – I are functional.


    The Phase – II of the Scheme for establishment of 24 new medical colleges has been approved by Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in its meeting held on 7 th February, 2018. The objective of the Phase – II of the scheme is for ensuring the availability of one medical college in every 3 Parliamentary Constituencies and one Government medical college in each State.


    Three districts in Bihar namely Purnia, Saran (Chhapara) and Samastipur were identified under Phase – I of the above scheme to establish new medical colleges. The medical colleges at Purina, Saran (Chhapara) have been approved. However, DPR for Samastipur was not approved as the existing District Hospital land area does not fulfill the minimum land area requirement prescribed under IMC Act, 1956 for establishment of new medical college.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
