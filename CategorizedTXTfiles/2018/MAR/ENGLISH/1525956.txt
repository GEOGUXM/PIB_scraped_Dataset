      Posted On: 22 MAR 2018 6:14PM by PIB Delhi


    As per approved Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) of BharatmalaPariyojana the base case scenario is to take up 60 % of projects under Hybrid Annuity Mode (HAM) and 10 % under BOT (Toll) and remaining on Engineering, Procurement, Construction (EPC) Mode.


    Government of India has approved Toll Operate and Transfer (TOT) model under which the Public funded projects operational for two years shall be put to bid wherein the right of collection and appropriation of fee shall be assigned for a pre determined concession period (30 years) to Concessionaires (Developers/Investors) against upfront payment of a lump sum amount to NHAI. Operation and Maintenance (O&M) obligation of such projects shall be with the concessionaire till the completion of the concession period. Projects to be undertaken in the TOT model are to be treated as Public-private-partnership (PPP) projects.


    The first bundle of TOT projects comprising of 9 project stretches aggregating to a length of 680km has already finalised and Letter of Award(LOA) has been issued. Apart from TOT Bundle-I, NHAI has also identified stretches of approximate length of 1640 kms under TOT in which condition survey and traffic studies is under progress.


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways Shri Mansukh Lal Mandavia in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
