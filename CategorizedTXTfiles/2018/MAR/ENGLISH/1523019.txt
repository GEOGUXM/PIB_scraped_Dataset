      Posted On: 07 MAR 2018 5:46PM by PIB Delhi


    Speeding-up of trains is a constant endeavour and continuous process on Indian Railways which is dependent on the constant optimization of the investments made by Railways in modernization of technology, high powered locos, modern coaches (LHB, air brake, CBC), improved signaling system and better tracks.


    During the year 2017-18, 51 train services have been speeded up by more than one hour.


    Government has also identified six corridors on Diamond of the country (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai & Kolkata) for high speed rail connectivity viz : (i) Delhi-Mumbai, (ii) Mumbai-Chennai, (iii) Chennai-Kolkata, (iv) Kolkata-Delhi and both diagonals i.e. (v) Delhi-Chennai and (vi) Mumbai-Kolkata routes. However, High Speed Projects are highly capital and technology intensive, therefore, the sanction of High Speed Projects is subject to its technical feasibility, financial viability and availability of resources.


    At present, Mumbai-Ahmedabad Rail corridor is the only High Speed Rail Project sanctioned in the Country.


    This information was made available in reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
