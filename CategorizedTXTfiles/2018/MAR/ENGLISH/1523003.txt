    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, in his message on the eve of International Women’s Day, which is observed every year on March 8, has said: -


    “On the occasion of International Women’s Day, I extend my greetings to all women.


    This is a day to recognise the contributions of women in different facets of life, whether personal or professional. India’s women have succeeded admirably in their endeavours, often in the face of formidable challenges. They are a source of inspiration for their families and for our society and nation.


    On this occasion, let us resolve to build a better society where women can realise their full potential and can give their best for nation’s development. Let us work to a future where every Indian woman gets what she deserves – equal treatment under conditions of equality.


    I wish the International Women’s Day all success.”
