    It is pertinent to note that population in age group (18-23 years) is considered as eligible population for the purpose of enrolment in Higher Education.


    The aim of Government is to achieve overall Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of 30% by 2020 in Higher Education as against GER of 25.2% in 2016-17 (as per AISHE, 2016-17).
