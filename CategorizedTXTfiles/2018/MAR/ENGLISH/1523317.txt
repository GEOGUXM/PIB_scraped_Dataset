    Expressing the Government’s commitment to improve the status of women scientists, Union Minister for Science and Technology, Earth Sciences and Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, has urged the scientific fraternity to correct the under-representation of women in the field of Science & Technology.
