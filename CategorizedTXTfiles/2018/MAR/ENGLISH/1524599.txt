    The State has submitted proposals for Fast Track Performa Clearance (FTPC) in respect of five projects namely; Gundlakamma Reservoir Project, Pushkara Lift Irrigation Scheme, Thotapally Barrage Project, Tarakaram Teerta Sagaram and Yerrakalva Reservoir Project. FTPC for Gundlakamma project has been accorded. Its estimated cost of Rs.397.41 crore at 2005-06 price level has increased to Rs.697.39 crore at 2015-16 price level. FTPC of other 4 projects depends upon satisfactory compliances/information from the State Government in this regard.
