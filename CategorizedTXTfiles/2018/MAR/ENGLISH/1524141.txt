    Under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP), Government has proposed an incentive of Rs.500 per patient per month for the nutritional support of the TB-affected patients during the course of the treatment. The States have the option for providing these incentives in cash or kind.


    The Ministry has formulated the Guidance Document on nutritional care and support for TB patients which includes guidance on nutritional assessment, counselling and appropriate dietary advice. The programme is also facilitating the TB patients to avail various social support schemes of the State Governments.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
