    Indian Air Force:


    There is a marginal shortage of pilots in Indian Air Force against the authorised establishment. However, the available strength of pilots in the IAF is sufficient to meet the current operational requirements. With the accretions sanctioned by the Government in the recent past, these shortages would be mitigated.


    The induction process has been streamlined and simplified. Selection process in vogue is satisfactory, with proactive steps been taken by the armed forces to reduce the shortage, which includes participation in career fairs / exhibitions, advertisements in print and electronic media, motivational lectures in schools & colleges, visuals / signage at strategic locations, etc.


    Apart from the above, regular Army Melas at Army Command level, Aviation specific demonstrations during NCC parades, advertisement through Additional Director General Public Information and on website in open domain are undertaken for increasing awareness and attracting youth to armed forces.
