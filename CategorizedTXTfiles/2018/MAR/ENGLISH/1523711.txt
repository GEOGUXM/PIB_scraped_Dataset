    In the 26 th meeting held here today , the GST Council has been apprised of the fact that CBEC and GSTN have started detailed data analytics across a number of data sets available with them. The outcome of preliminary data analysis has revealed interesting insights:

      * It has emerged that there is variance between the amount of IGST & Compensation Cess paid by importers at Customs ports and input tax credit of the same claimed in GSTR-3B.
      * There are major data gaps between self-declared liability in FORM GSTR-1 and FORM GSTR-3B.

    It was deliberated that this information may be further analysed and adequate action may be initiated accordingly.
