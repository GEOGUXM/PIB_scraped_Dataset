      Posted On: 15 MAR 2018 5:20PM by PIB Delhi


    Department of School Education and Literacy is implementing an Umbrella Scheme for Providing Education to Madarsas/Minorities (SPEMM) which comprises of two schemes, namely, Scheme for Providing Quality Education in Madarsas (SPQEM) and Infrastructure Development in Minority Institutions (IDMI). SPEMM is completely voluntary/demand driven scheme in nature.


    SPQEM provides interalia for financial assistance to support a maximum of three teachers in a madarsa through the State Governments concerned for honorarium of full time Graduate teachers @ Rs.6000/-p.m. and Post Graduate/B.Ed. teachers @Rs. 12000/-p.m..


    In the financial years 2016-17 and 2017-18, Rs.120 crore had been allocated to the Scheme for Providing Education in Madarsas/Minorities (SPEMM) in each year, out of which under SPQEM Rs.106.94 crore, benefiting 20,969 madarsa teachers and Rs.64.00 crore (till end of February) benefiting 12,518 madarsa teachers have been spent in the years 2016-17 and 2017-18 respectively.


    During the Central Grant in Aid Committee (CGIAC) meeting held on 14.01.2016 for the year 2015-16, a decision was taken that only those Madarsas which have U-DISE Codes or an Unique Identity/ Registration code given by State Governments would be assisted. Accordingly, the proposals where the State Governments have provided the UDISE codes for the Madrasas are processed as per availability of budget.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Shri Upendra Kushwaha today in a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question.
