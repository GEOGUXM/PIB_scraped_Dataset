    To implement Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of “Doubling Farmer’s Income”, Shri Suresh Prabhu, Minister of Commerce and Industry has taken the initiative to draft an “Agriculture Export Policy” in the larger interest of farmers and agricultural exports.


    The Ministry of Commerce & Industry has come up with a draft “Agriculture Export Policy” which is aimed at doubling the agricultural exports and integrate Indian farmers and agricultural products to the global value chain.


    Preliminary meeting with stakeholders was held to get their feedback on the proposed policy. Based on the preliminary inputs a draft policy document is prepared. The draft Agriculture Export Policy is put up in the public domain in order to seek wider consultation and feedback/suggestions from the stakeholders so as to provide the final shape to the Policy.


    The document is available in “Whats New” section of the home page of Department of Commerce website. ( http://commerce.gov.in/writereaddata/uploadedfile/MOC_636570683307194585_Draft_Agr_Export_Policy.pdf )


    The suggestions may be forwarded at santosh.sarangi@nic.in and ramesh.n77@gov.in by 5 th April, 2018.
