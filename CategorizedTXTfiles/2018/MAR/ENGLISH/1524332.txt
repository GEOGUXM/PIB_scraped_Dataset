      Posted On: 14 MAR 2018 4:33PM by PIB Delhi


    An Indian Army patrol observed three civilians believed to be Chinese nationals carrying out track construction in Arunachal Pradesh on the Indian side of the LAC. The three civilians returned to the Chinese side of the LAC on seeing the Indian Army patrol. As per the agreed modalities, a Flag Meeting was arranged to discuss the intrusion. The Chinese side admitted that the three civilians had crossed over the LAC and agreed to withdraw their equipment immediately.


    Government regularly takes up such matters along the LAC with the Chinese side through established mechanisms including Border Personnel Meetings, Flag Meetings, meetings of Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs, as well as through diplomatic channels.


    Indian Army is fully seized of the security needs of the country in the border areas. Necessary steps including construction / upgradation of roads, capability enhancement and infrastructure development havebeen undertaken to ensure that the National Security concerns along the Borders are adequately addressed.
