      Posted On: 05 MAR 2018 5:11PM by PIB Delhi


    As per an analysis done in January, 2015 on National Register for Driving Licences by National Informatics Centre (NIC) regarding fake driving licenses, it was found that there is a possibility of duplicate licences. As on 5 th January, 2015, out of total 6,70,16,851 driving licences records available, 16,72,138 records were found to be possible duplicates spread over 7,99,923 clusters. The percentage of probable duplicates stands at 2.5 percent as per this exercise. This information has been shared with respective states for further action.


    Provisions regarding issue of driving licences are contained in Chapter II of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988(MV Act) and Chapter II of Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989(CMVRs). Rule 15(2) of the CMVRs states that the test of competence to drive referred to in sub=-section (3) of section 9 shall be conducted by the licensing authority or such other person as may be authorised in this behalf by the State Government. Implementation of provisions of MV Act and CMVRs come under purview of State Governments concerned.


    T he Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, 2017, passed by Lok Sabha and presently in Rajya Sabha for consideration and passing inter-alia proposes many clauses which will promote simplification and citizen facilitation. Further, t he Ministry has introduced online based citizen centric application VAHAN 4.0 and SARATHI 4.0 to ease out the process of obtaining driving licences such as online application, payment of fees or booking an appointment at the RTO for a new Driving Licence etc.


    This information is given by the Minister of State for Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways and Chemical & Fertilizers Shri Mansukh L Mandaviya in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
