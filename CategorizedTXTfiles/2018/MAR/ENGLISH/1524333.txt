      Posted On: 14 MAR 2018 4:34PM by PIB Delhi


    Modernisation of defence sector is a continuous process and is undertaken based on threat perception, operational challenges, technological changes and available resources. The process of defence acquisition is based on the fifteen years Long Term Integrated Perspective Plan (LTIPP), five years Services Capital Acquisition Plan (SCAP) and an Annual Acquisition Plan (AAP). Government also constantly reviews the security scenario and accordingly decides to induct appropriate defence equipment to keep the Armed Forces in a state of readiness.


    The Government of India remains continuously vigilant and is firm in its resolve to take all necessary steps to effectively safeguard India’s security and territorial integrity.


    Apart from the main responsibility of defending the borders of the country, the Armed Forces render timely assistance to civil authorities for the maintenance of law and order and / or essential services as also in rescue and relief operations during natural calamities. Specific details of action taken in this regard are included in chapter-12 of the Annual Reports regarding “Cooperation between Armed Forces and Civil Authorities” of the Ministry of Defence, which are available on the website of the Ministry (mod.nic.in).


    The Government is pursuing several initiatives to strengthen the defence industry as per details, given below:-

      * Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) has been revised in 2016 wherein specific provisions have been introduced for stimulating growth of the domestic defence industry.

      * Government has notified the ‘Strategic Partnership (SP)’ Model which envisages establishment of long-term strategic partnerships with Indian entities through a transparent and competitive process, wherein they would tie up with global Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to seek technology transfers to set up domestic manufacturing infrastructure and supply chain.
      * The ‘Make’ Procedures has been simplified with provisions for funding of 90% of development cost by the Government to Indian Industry and reserving projects not exceeding development cost of Rs. 10 crore (Government funded) and Rs. 3 crore (Industry funded) for MSMEs.
