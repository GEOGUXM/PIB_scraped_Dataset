      Posted On: 06 MAR 2018 6:09PM by PIB Delhi


    In order to promote fortification as a means to address micro nutrient deficiencies, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has operationalised on 16.10.2016, the draft Food Safety and Standards (Fortification of Foods) Regulations, 2016 that, inter-alia, includes provisions regarding standards for fortification of food articles namely wheat flour, rice, milk, edible oil and salt with vitamins and minerals. At present, all the major oil producers in the country are voluntarily fortifying at least one brand in their product portfolios.


    The draft Food Safety and Standards (Fortification of Food) Regulations, 2016 stipulate that the FSSAI may from time to time mandate fortification of any food article specified under the regulations on the directions of the Government of India or on the recommendations of the States/UTs and in consultation with stakeholders. Under Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restriction on Sales) Regulations, 2011, sale of only iodized salt is permitted for direct human consumption. Further, Food Safety and Standards (Food Product Standards and Food Additives) Regulations, 2011 provide that Vanaspati shall contain synthetic Vitamin A.


    Besides, Ministry of Women and Child Development and Ministry of Human Resource Development have advised the use of double fortified salt (iron and iodine), wheat flour (with iron, folic acid and vitamin B-12) and edible oil with (vitamin A and D) under their Schemes i.e. Integrated Child Development Scheme and Mid-day Meal Scheme .


    FSSAI has established Food Fortification Resource Centre (FFRC) in collaboration with Tata Trusts and various International NGOs working in the field of nutrition as a resource centre to promote large-scale fortification of food and to nudge & facilitate food businesses to adopt fortification as a norm.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
