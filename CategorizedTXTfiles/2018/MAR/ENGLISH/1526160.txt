      Implementation of UGC Grievances Redressal Regulations
      Posted On: 23 MAR 2018 5:11PM by PIB Delhi


    The University Grants Commission (UGC) Grievance Redressal Regulations, 2012 prescribes for well defined systems and procedures for redressal of grievances of aggrieved students in Universities and Colleges. These regulations are mandatory for implementation by all Universities/affiliated Colleges in India. UGC issues directions to Universities, from time to time, to effectively implement grievance redressal regulations. Further, as per these regulations, an Ombudsman is required to be appointed by each university to effectively address and resolve grievances lodged by students at University level. The UGC has been closely monitoring the implementation of the grievance redressal systems and procedures as contained in the Regulations.


    The UGC has launched an Online Student Grievance Redressal Portal to ensure transparency in admission, prevent unfair practices in Higher Education Institutions and provide effective mechanism for redressal of the grievances. This Portal facilitates the students/complainants to lodge their grievance, send reminders and view the status of action taken on their grievances. The system also facilitates Universities to search and browse grievances lodged by the students and post action taken on complaints as well as contact complainant directly through e-mail, phone or by post.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Dr. Satya Pal Singh today in a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question.
