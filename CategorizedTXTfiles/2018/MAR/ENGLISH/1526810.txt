      Books Published by Sahitya Akademi in Hindi Facilitate Easier Onward Transmission into other Target Languages
      Posted On: 28 MAR 2018 4:31PM by PIB Delhi


    During the year 2015-16 and 2016-17 Sahitya Akademi published 974 books out of which 285 books were published in Hindi and the remaining 689 books were published in other languages. Sahitya Akademi publications in Hindi in the last two years are higher than other languages when one takes reprints also into consideration.


    Translations into Hindi facilitate easier onward transmission into languages for which translators may not be available â€“ for example, from Tamil to Kashmiri or Marathi to Maithili or Malayalam to Punjabi or Telugu to Bodo. When translated into Hindi first, it is easier to get those language works into target language desired. This is the main reason translations into Hindi gain prominence and hence larger number of Hindi publications.


    This information was given by Minister of State (I/C) for Culture and Minister of State for Environment, Forest & Climate Change Dr. Mahesh Sharma in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
