      Posted On: 21 MAR 2018 8:27PM by PIB Delhi


    The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its approval for closure of India Development Foundation of Overseas Indians (IDF-OI)to enhance synergies in channelizing Diaspora's contributions to Government of India's flagship programmes such as National Mission for clean Ganga and Swachh Bharat Mission.


    Background:

     1. IDF-OI was set up by Government of India with the approval of Cabinet in 2008 as an autonomous not-for-profit Trust, to facilitate Overseas Indian philanthropy into social and development projects in India.

     1. As the Foundation received only Rs. 36.80 Lakhs between December 2008 and March 2015 as donation from overseas Indian community, a comprehensive review of IDF-OI was undertaken in 2015. Promotion of Government of India's Flagship programmes - National Mission for Clean Ganga and Swachh Bharat Mission; and Social and Development projects identified by State Governments - was added to the mandate of IDF-OI.


     1. Although, between April 2015 and March 2018, the Trust received Rs.10.16 crore, most of the contribution received were for either projects related to National Mission for Clean Ganga or Swachh Bharat Mission, which are separately administered by their respective Administrative Agencies. In order to enhance synergies, improve efficiencies and avoid duplication of work, it was decided by the 9 th Meeting of Board of Trustees of the IDF-OI that the Trust would be closed down by March 31, 2018.
