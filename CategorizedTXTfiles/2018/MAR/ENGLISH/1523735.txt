    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, hosted today (March 10, 2018) a banquet in honour of the President of the French Republic, His Excellency Mr Emmanuel Macron, and Heads of State/Government attending the founding conference of the International Solar Alliance at Rashtrapati Bhavan.


    Welcoming Presidents, Vice Presidents, Prime Ministers, Deputy Prime Ministers and Ministers from over 45 countries as well as Heads of International Organisations, the President thanked them for their support for the International Solar Alliance. He said that the International Solar Alliance is embarking on a gleaming journey. The presence of so many distinguished leaders from all corners of our planet at the Conference tomorrow is an assertion that “ We did not inherit our future from our ancestors; we have borrowed it from our children” . It is this shared realisation of our debt to the future that has led us to craft the International Solar Alliance.


    The President said that India and France stand at the threshold of becoming technological and manufacturing partners in cutting-edge defence cooperation, even as we enhance the operational links between our militaries. India sees France as an important partner in its quest for clean and renewable energy and for a sustainable future.


    The President said that the India-France global partnership is in an expansive mode. We should continue to work together, with ever greater commitment, for peace, security and stability.
