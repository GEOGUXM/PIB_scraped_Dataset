    The scheme is implemented through the State Government. It has been decided to discontinue the Scheme of ‘Vocational Training in Tribal Areas’ from 2018-19 and subsume the interventions of vocational training (skill / livelihood) in the scheme ‘Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS)’. The Scheme ‘SCA to TSS is demand driven. Under the scheme SCA to TSS, State Government is responsible for formulation of annual proposal based upon the need in the State within their share of allocation. The proposal received from the State Government is appraised and approved by the Project Appraisal Committee (PAC) in the Ministry chaired by Secretary, Ministry of Tribal Affairs with representatives of State Governments, Financial Advisor, NITI Aayog, etc. for funding.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Tribal Affairs Shri Jaswantsinh Bhabhor in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
