    Smt. Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, Union Minister for Women and Child Development, has taken serious cognizance of news reports stating that forged letter pads of the Hon'ble Minister were seized from two animal smugglers in Bareilly, on Monday.


    The accused were caught by local police for illegally transporting animals. Fake letter pads and seals of other senior officers were also recovered from them.
    Smt. Gandhi has clarified that no such letters have ever been issued to individuals or institutions. "I have always advocated animal welfare, and have never used my letter head for authorising any entity or individual to illegally transport animals. I have been informed by the Bareilly Police that the two miscreants have been taken into custody. I have requested for stern action to be initiated against them for this illegal act," said the Hon'ble Minister.
