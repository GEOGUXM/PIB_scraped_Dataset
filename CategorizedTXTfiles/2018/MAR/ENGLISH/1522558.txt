    The National Highways Authority of India is taking all efforts to ensure that National Highways are of good quality, safe, reliable, comfortable for road users and are maintained well.In a recent directive NHAI Chairman Shri Deepak Kumar has asked all Regional Officers/Project Directors to strictly monitor the road conditions and take timely action for rectification of damaged stretches through the concessionaires/contractors if the same is within their scope or through a selected agency, as per the extant policy of NHAI. He has directed that in case the concessionaire/ contractor fails to fulfil its contractual O&M obligations, appropriate damages as per agreements should be levied and appropriate action for maintenance should be initiated forthwith. Also, he has emphasized that if there is any laxity on the part of Independent Engineer, appropriate action against them will be taken.


    Project Directors/Regional Officers have been directed to take pro-active action under the provisions of the Concession Agreement/Consultancy Agreement pertaining to projects being operated by the Concessionaire. Also, in case of the public funded projects (non-PPP Projects) where the O&M obligations is the direct responsibility of NHAI, the Project Directors/ Regional Officers have been directed to periodically inspect these highways and take remedial measures to ensure that the highway, at all times, is in traffic worthy condition and conforms to the maintenance requirements. The field officials are also being encouraged to take corrective/ preventive action so that adequate maintenance is done on these projects.In this regard, NHAI also takes cognizance of complaints received from road users about poorly maintained National Highways.
