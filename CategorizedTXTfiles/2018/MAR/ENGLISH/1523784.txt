    Labour Bureauâ€™s revamped Quarterly Employment Survey (QES) launched in April, 2016 measures relative change in employment situation over successive quarters in sizeable segment of Non-farm Industrial economy. The survey covers 8 major sectors which constitute around 81 percent of the total employment of establishments employing 10 or more workers as per the 6 th Economic census, conducted during January, 2013 to April, 2014. The Sixth QES has shown an increase of 64,000 jobs during the April-June quarter of 2017. This increasing trend is observed over and above the four preceding quarters. The results also indicate a fall in manufacturing sector employment to the tune of 87,000. This is attributed to seasonal activities during this period since unit level data suggest that fall in employment was essentially registered in brick manufacturing units with the onset of monsoons.


    This information was given by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar Union Minister of State (I/C) for Labour and Employment in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
