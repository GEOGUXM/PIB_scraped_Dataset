    Suitable amendments to the provisions of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens (MWPSC) Act, 2007 are under consideration in the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. Major amendments proposed in the existing Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 comprise, removal of maximum ceiling of maintenance allowance; extension of right to appeal to the respondents also; extension of benefit of revocation of transfer of property to parents also; reckoning of time limit for disposal of applications by the Tribunal from the date of receipt of application etc.


    Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment doesn’t maintain such data that a large number of senior citizens have been abandoned/denied maintenance by their children. As per the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State Subjects, and as such the primary responsibility of prevention, detection, registration, investigation and prosecution of crime including crime against Senior Citizens lies with the State/UT Administrations.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Vijay Sampla in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
