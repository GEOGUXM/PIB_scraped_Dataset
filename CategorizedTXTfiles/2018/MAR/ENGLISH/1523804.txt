      Posted On: 12 MAR 2018 3:36PM by PIB Delhi


    Delhi High Court in its order dated 28 November 2017 has not given any specific direction to grant Military Service Pay (MSP) equally to all ranks. It may be informed that the court in its order mentioned that the conduct of the petitioners in withholding material information and at the same time, trying to invoke equities under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is deprecated.


    The 7 th Central Pay Commission (CPC) had considered all aspects with regard to applicability of MSP including the rates while making its recommendations. The Government after carefully considering the recommendations of the 7 th CPC in respect of MSP has accepted the same and have already been notified.


    This information was given by RakshaRajyaMantriDr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri Mahendra Singh Mahrain Rajya Sabha today.
