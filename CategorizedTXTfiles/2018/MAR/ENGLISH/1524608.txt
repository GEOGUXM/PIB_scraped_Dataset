    The Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) is a Public Sector Enterprise of the Department of Atomic Energy and fully owned by the Government of India. The mandate of NPCIL is implementation of the first stage of the indigenous three-stage nuclear power programme comprising of natural uranium fuelled Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) and Light Water Reactors (LWRs) set up with foreign technical cooperation.


    NPCIL activities include all aspects of commercial nuclear power reactors encompassing Design, Construction, Commissioning, Operation & Maintenance, Renovation & Modernisation, Research & Development, Upgrades, Life Management and Waste Management.


    This was stated by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
