      Nutrition Rehabilitation Centres
      Posted On: 16 MAR 2018 3:25PM by PIB Delhi


    The performance of Nutrition Rehabilitation Centres (NRCs) is regularly reviewed through Quarterly progress reports (QPRs) shared by States and UTs in meetings.


    Presently there are 1151 NRCs across the country with 12,314 beds. In year 2016-17, total 1.88 lakhs children were admitted to these NRCs. The average bed occupancy rate was 64% and cure rate was 58% nationally.


    There are no reports of shortage of funds or commodities in NRCs and therefore no specific survey has been conducted.


    To improve functionality of the NRCs, field visits are undertaken to provide supportive supervision during different programme monitoring visits and feedbacks provided to the NRC staff as well as State Child Health Programme Officers for taking appropriate actions for the issues identified.


    During annual Child Health Review Meeting for the State Child Health Programme Officers, being held at national level, performance review findings are shared with them along with recommendations to improve functionality.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Smt Anupriya Patel stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
