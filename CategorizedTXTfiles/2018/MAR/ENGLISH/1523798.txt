      Empanelment of Hospitals for ECHS Facilities
      Posted On: 12 MAR 2018 3:29PM by PIB Delhi


    Empanelment of private hospitals with ECHS depends on the willingness of the hospitals to accept CGHS Rates and to abide by the procedures and rules of ECHS. The Government is continuously empanelling private hospitals, which are applying for empanelment and are found eligible for empanelment as per ECHS rules. In the recent past 217, 189, 123, and 85 private hospitals have been empanelled on 10.11.2016, 2.06.2017, 05.12.2017 and 04.01.2018 respectively. A total of 2609 hospitals are empanelled with ECHS as on date.
