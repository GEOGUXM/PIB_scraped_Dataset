      Elimination of Unmanned Level Crossings
      Posted On: 28 MAR 2018 6:52PM by PIB Delhi


    It has been decided to eliminate all Unmanned Level Crossings (UMLCs) on Broad Gauge (BG) route in next 2 years by either of the following methods:-

      * Closure – Closing unmanned level crossings having NIL/ negligible Train Vehicle Unit (TVU).
      * Merger – Merger of unmanned level crossing to nearby manned or unmanned gates or subway/Road Under Bridge (RUB)/Road Over Bridge (ROB) by construction of diversion road.
      * Provision of Subways/RUBs.
      * Manning – The unmanned level crossings which cannot be eliminated by above means will be progressively manned based on rail-road traffic volume, visibility conditions.

    During the last 3 years and the current year (upto Feb.2018), 5156 UMLCs have been eliminated out of which 1986 were manned and 3170 were closed by closure/merger/subway.


    Zone-wise data of UMLCs eliminated during the last three years and the current year (upto Feb.18) is as follows:
