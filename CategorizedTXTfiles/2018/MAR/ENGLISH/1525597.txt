The payment for tickets booked through IRCTC website is made through various cashless modes such as net banking, through credit/debit cards, cash cards and e-wallets. To incentivise payment through digital means, service charge on online booking of tickets was withdrawn for the tickets booked from 23.11.2016. The facility has been extended upto 31.03.2018.


    ii. Indian Railways have tied up with State Bank of India to install 10,000 Point of Sale (POS) machines at various locations of Indian Railways i.e. Passenger Reservation System (PRS)/ Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS) ticket booking counters and Parcel/Goods locations.


    iii. Booking of tickets through mobile phone has also been introduced wherein payment can be made through credit/debit cards, net banking, e-wallets etc.


    iv. Service charge applicable on transactions against credit/debit cards for purchasing journey tickets at UTS/PRS counters has been withdrawn.


    v. International credit/debit cards issued outside India are accepted for booking of e-tickets through IRCTC website.


    vi. Automatic Ticket Vending Machines (ATVMs) have been introduced to facilitate sale of unreserved tickets which have provision of payment through smart cards.


    vii. 0.5% discount is given on purchase of season tickets through digital means with effect from 01.01.2017 upto 31.03.2018.


    viii. It has been decided to provide 5% discount on the total value of basic fare in PRS reserved counter ticket subject to maximum amount of discount of Rs. 50 on a ticket for payments made through Unified Payment Interface (UPI) including Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) subject to value of ticket being Rs. 100 and more.


    ix. Electronic Payment system for collection of freight charges is already in place. All major customers are covered under this system and around 83% of total freight is being collected through it, besides, there is provision for collecting wagon registration fee under electronic registration of demand for wagons through IRCTC payment gateway.
