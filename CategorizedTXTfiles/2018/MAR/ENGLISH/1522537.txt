      Posted On: 05 MAR 2018 5:04PM by PIB Delhi


    The National Highways Authority of India is in the process of rolling-out an integrated setup through the Traffic Incident Emergency Management System (TIMS), where Incident Management Contractors will be appointed at a state/regional office level for providing ambulances, tow-away cranes and highway surveillance vehicles across all highways in the state / region, and a Regional Command and Control Centre for monitoring and operations, in the States of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh on a pilot basis.


    Many highways are already covered by ambulances, patrol vehicles and tow-away cranes through incident management services provided by BOT and OMT highway concessionaires. In each of the pilot states of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, tentatively 100-110 additional ambulances are planned to be provided through the Incident Management service contractor.


    Bids are being invited for providing Integrated Incident Management services across highways for the pilot project. The implementation is expected to take 6-9 months. On successful implementation in these two states, the program will then be scaled up to a national level.


    This information is given by the Minister of State for Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways and Chemical & Fertilizers Shri Mansukh L Mandaviya in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
