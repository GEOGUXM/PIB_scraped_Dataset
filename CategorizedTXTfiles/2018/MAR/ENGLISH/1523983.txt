    As per the extant guidelines of Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRSs), EMRSs are set up in the States/ UTs with the capacity of 480 students in each school under the Special Area Programme of Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution of India. The guidelines stipulate that each State Government/ UT Administration is solely responsible for the management and effective functioning of the EMRSs and appointment of staff, personnel matters and day-to-day running of the schools would be handled entirely by the society chosen by the State Government/UT Administration and in the manner deemed most suitable. Therefore, the subject of permanent teachers in the schools is not centrally maintained.


    Establishment of EMRS is a demand driven activity funded under the scheme of Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution. State Governments submit proposals for setting up of EMRSs and the proposals are then appraised and approved by the Project Appraisal Committee (PAC) in the Ministry. A total number of fourteen (14) new EMRSs have been approved to be set up across the country during 2017-18.


    Funds released to States for EMRSs (Non-Recurring) during 2017-18:
