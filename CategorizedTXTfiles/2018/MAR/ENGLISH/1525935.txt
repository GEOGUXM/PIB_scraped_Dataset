    The National Biogas and Manure Management Programme (NBMMP) aims at setting up of family type biogas plants for providing biogas as clean cooking fuel and a source of lighting. The slurry produced from biogas plants as a by-product is an organic bio-manure for enhancing crop yield and maintaining soil health. The biogas technology dissemination helps in reducing the environment degradation and prevents the emissions of Green House Gases (GHGs) such as Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and Methane into the atmosphere. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has fixed an annual physical target of setting up 65,180 biogas plants for the current year 2017-18 under the NBMMP .


    Under the NBMMP, about 49.6 lakh household size biogas plants have been installed since the inception of the National Biogas Programme in the country.


    The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), through the State Nodal Agencies/ Departments, spreads awareness about the programme (NBMMP) through advertisements in local Newspapers, display of posters in Panchayats Offices, Schools, Kisan Seva Kendraâ€™s, distribution of booklets on biogas during gatherings at exhibitions, Kisan Melas/Fairs etc.


    The MNRE has taken various steps to increase the production of biogas in the country including Tamil Nadu which include introduction of new biogas plant designs under the NBMMP such as floating design Shakti Surabhi Model, Solid-State Deenbandhu design model of biogas plants.


    This information was provided by Shri R.K. Singh, Union Minister of State (IC) Power and New & Renewable Energy in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
