    The Ministry of Tourism promotes India as a holistic destination. The Ministry of Tourism has recognized Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions (MICE) as a ‘Niche Tourism’ product in order to overcome the aspect of ‘seasonality’ and to promote India as a 365 days’ destination and attract tourists with specific interests to India.


    The India Convention Promotion Bureau (ICPB) has been set up under the patronage of the Ministry of Tourism to promote India as a venue for International Conferences and Exhibitions. This non-profit organization, with members comprising national airlines, hotels, travel agents, tour operators, tourist transport operators, conference organizers, etc. participate in International MICE Tourism trade fairs like IMEX in Frankfurt and Las Vegas, EIBTM- Barcelona and AIME- Melbourne along with the Indiatourism overseas offices. India is also being promoted as a preferred MICE destination through the Global Incredible India media campaign and through Road Shows and Seminars conducted by the India Tourism offices overseas. Ministry of Tourism also provides Central Financial Assistance to the State Governments/UT Administrations for development of tourism infrastructure including the setting up of convention centres under the existing schemes.


    This information was given by Shri K. J. Alphons, Union Minister of State (I/C) for Tourism in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
