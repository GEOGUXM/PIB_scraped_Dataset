Community engagement through College Student Volunteers is envisioned in 115 most backward districts as part of the Block Level initiatives and during FY 2017-18, 50 most backward districts to be covered (8 blocks per district).


      Annual budget for block level activities is Rs 35.36 lakh per block.

These centres will serve as a link between village, block and state levels in facilitating women centric schemes and also give foothold to BBBP at the district level. The annual budget for each District Level Centre for Women is Rs 12.30 lakh.
