      Categorization of Railway Stations
      Posted On: 21 MAR 2018 5:32PM by PIB Delhi


    Criteria for categorisation of stations have been revised w.e.f. November, 2017. As per the new categorization, both number of footfalls and passenger earnings of stations have been taken into account for categorization of stations.


    The stations have been clubbed into 3 groups i.e. Non-suburban (NSG), Suburban (SG) and Halt (HG). Further these groups have been put in grades ranging from 1-6, 1-3 and 1-3 respectively.
