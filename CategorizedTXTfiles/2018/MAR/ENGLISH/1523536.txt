      Loans advanced by the Central Government to States/ UTs
      Posted On: 09 MAR 2018 5:53PM by PIB Delhi


    The details of loans advanced by the Central Government to States/ UTs, during last three years from 2014-15 to 2016-17 alongwith the outstanding amount as at the end of 2016-17 are at Annex-I .


    The loans such as World Bank loans are audited by Comptroller and Auditor General or Independent Auditor and are vetted by the World Bank. If the auditor reports any diversion of funds or misclassification of expenditure, funds/loans are not released by the World Bank/Asian Development Bank for that particular item of expenditure. Further, the Government takes several measures to monitor and speed up the disbursement of loans and ensures that the projects are implemented within the agreed time frame. Strict monitoring of disbursements/project through Tripartite Portfolio Review Meetings (TPRMs), State Review Meetings (SRM) and other meetings are undertaken.
