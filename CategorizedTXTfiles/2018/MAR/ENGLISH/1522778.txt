      Posted On: 06 MAR 2018 6:10PM by PIB Delhi


    The data of people affected by mental health issues is not maintained centrally. As per the World Health Organisation’s Report “Depression and Other Common Mental Disorders – Global Health Estimates” released in 2017, the estimated prevalence of depressive disorders in India is 4.5% of the total population. However, as per the National Mental Health Survey conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bangalore in 12 States of the country, the prevalence of depressive disorders in India is estimated to be 2.7% of the total population.


    Counselling sessions have not been made mandatory in educational institutions and offices. However, the Government is implementing a District Mental Health Programme (DMHP) for detection, management and treatment of mental disorders/illness in 517 districts of the country under the National Mental Health Programme ( NMHP), which is being implemented since 1982. The major components of DMHP are counselling in schools and colleges, work place stress management, life skills training, suicide prevention services and IEC activities for generation of awareness and removal of stigma associated with Mental Illness.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
