    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind in his message on the eve of Mahavir Jayanti has said: -


    “On the auspicious occasion of Mahavir Jayanti, I extend my greetings and best wishes to all my fellow citizens especially to the Jain community.


    The life and teachings of Lord Mahavira are relevant and significant in the present day and age. Lord Mahavira gave a message of truth and non-violence to humankind. The principal of ‘Live and Let Live’ espoused by Lord Mahavira encourages values of equality and human dignity.


    Let us draw inspiration from the life and teachings of Lord Mahavira to establish peace, love, righteousness and harmony in the world.”
