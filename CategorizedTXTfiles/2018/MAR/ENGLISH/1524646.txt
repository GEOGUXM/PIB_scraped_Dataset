    For enhancement of Safety of commuters and Rail users, Ministry of Railways has decided to revamp platforms in Mumbai Suburban stations. Over Central & Western Railway Suburban sections, the work of raising of 421 Platforms started in 2015. So far, 344 platforms have been raised. The target date of completions is by June 2018.


    In Central Railway, out of 276 suburban platforms, there was scope for raising 269 platforms from 840 mm to 900 mm. So far 201 platforms have been raised upto 900 mm. The remaining 68 platforms are within revised Schedule of Dimension of 840-900 mm and work is under progress. Out of remaining 7 platforms, 3 platforms are redundant and being dismantled and 4 of Parel will be raised along with the work for construction of Parel Terminus.


    In Western Railway, raising of platforms for 145 stations from 840 mm to 900 mm was taken up in January, 2015. Work on 143 platforms has been completed and work is under progress at 02 platforms. The work on these 02 platforms shall be completed by April, 2018.


    Benefits of raised platforms are:

     1. It is convenient for commuters in alighting and boarding the train as the gap between footboard and the platforms becomes bare minimum.
     2. It also makes travel easier and more comfortable for Divyangjans.

    The work for 344 Platforms has been accomplished against all the odds and deterrent factors. The major constraints faced during the work were amidst running local train services everyday over vast Mumbai Railway Suburban network with heavy passenger traffic, the work of raising of Platforms was carried out only during mid night hours. Within the available 2- 3 hours during the night time, the work of raising of platform was carried out with the safety of passengers in mind and with the minimum inconvenience to the passengers.
