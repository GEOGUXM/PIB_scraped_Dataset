      Posted On: 06 MAR 2018 3:02PM by PIB Delhi


    Two Acts of Parliament namely, the Protection of Civil Rights (PCR) Act, 1955, which prescribes punishment for enforcement of any disability arising from practice of ‘untouchability’, and the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, intended to prevent offences of atrocities against members of the Scheduled Castes(SCs) and Scheduled Tribes(STs), are the prime legislative tools to dispense social justice. Since provisions of the PCR Act and the PoA Act and the Rules there under are implemented by the State Governments and Union Territory Administrations, towards effective execution of the two Acts, they are provided admissible Central assistance under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme for implementation of the PCR Act and the PoA Act. The allocation of funds under the said Scheme and the utilization thereof during 2016-17 and 2018-19 is indicated as under:-

2017-18          300.00            305.17                                       294.38 (as on 01.03.2018)
                                                                                                         
                                                                                                         

    The delivery of social justice has been further strengthened with amendments done in the PoA Act and the PoA Rules there under, in the year 2016 to provide members of SCs and STs a greater justice and enhanced relief amount to atrocity victims, and resultant increase in allocations under the aforesaid Scheme.
