    The number of people suffering from depression and other mental illness along with the related casualties is not maintained centrally. However, the Government had undertaken a National Mental Health Survey through the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore in 12 States of the country. As per the survey report released on 26 th December, 2016, the prevalence of mental disorders including common mental disorders, severe mental disorders, and alcohol and substance use disorders (excluding tobacco use disorder) in adults over the age of 18 years is about 10.6%. The major findings of the survey are as under:

      * The prevalence of mental morbidity is high in urban metropolitan areas.

      * Mental disorders are closely linked to both causation and consequences of several non-communicable disorders (NCD).


      * Nearly 1 in 40 and 1 in 20 persons suffer from past and current depression, respectively.


      * Neurosis and stress related disorders affect 3.5% of the population and was reported to be higher among females (nearly twice as much in males).


      * Data indicate that 0.9 % of the survey population were at high risk of suicide.


      * Nearly 50% of persons with major depressive disorders reported difficulties in carrying out their daily activities.


    The Government of India is implementing the District Mental Health programme (DMHP) under the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) in 517 districts of the country with the objectives to:
