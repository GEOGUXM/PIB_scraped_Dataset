      Repatriation of Illegal Bangladeshi Citizens
      Posted On: 14 MAR 2018 5:38PM by PIB Delhi


    There is no specific treaty or agreement with the Government of Bangladesh regarding repatriation of its citizens who have illegally entered into India.


    National Register of Citizens contains names of Indian Citizens only. Regarding deportation, details of the suspected illegal migrants, who are apprehended in India, are shared with the respective foreign Missions/Embassies through the Ministry of External Affairs for nationality verification. Such illegal migrants are deported after their nationality is confirmed and travel documents are issued by the respective Foreign Missions/Embassies.


    Details of Bangladeshi nationals deported to Bangladesh during the last five years are as follows :-
