    In order to facilitate the sanction of refunds, the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) has decided to extend the “Refund Fortnight” and keep open all the Customs field formations on 29.03.2018, 30.03.2018 and 31.03.2018 even though these are holidays/ non-working days. Necessary administrative instructions have been issued in this regard. The Government of India is keen to ensure that all the exporters get their refunds sanctioned at the earliest and, therefore, requests the exporters to avail this opportunity to settle their refund claims if not done as yet.


    Earlier, the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) had taken an initiative to observe a Refund Sanction Fortnight from 15 th March to 29 th March, 2018 on an all India scale. Administrative and logistical arrangements were made in order to ensure that maximum number of pending refund claims are settled during the said fortnight. As per the reports from field offices of CBEC, most of the refund claims which were pending due to errors committed while filing the GST returns and where exporters came forward with requisite documentation ​,​ have been settled. However, the Government of India is keen to ensure that all the exporters get their refunds sanctioned at the earliest and, therefore, requests the exporters to avail this opportunity to settle their refund claims if not done as yet.
