During  2015-16                    1447
                                       
                                       
                                       
During  2016-17                    1476
                                       
                                       
                                       
During  2017-18 [Upto 28-02-2018]  1053
                                       
                                       

    The accounts of NGOs are audited by chartered accountants as per the guidelines of the schemes under which grants are given to the NGOs. The Ministry does not empanel chartered accountants for this purpose. After release of grants-in-aid to NGOs, the final accounts for a financial year are required to be rendered by them with utilization certificate and audited accounts signed by a chartered accountant within six months of the close of the financial year. In case the NGOs (i) do not get their accounts audited (ii) do not follow the norms, and (iii) do not maintain their accounts properly then no further grants-in-aid is released to that NGO. Also, the Ministry can initiate action to blacklist such organization and take legal action for recovery of funds released to them.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Vijay Sampla in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
