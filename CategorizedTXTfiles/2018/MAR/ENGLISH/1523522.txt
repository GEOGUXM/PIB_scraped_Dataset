      Redevelopment of Railway Stations under AMRUT Scheme
      Posted On: 09 MAR 2018 5:21PM by PIB Delhi


    A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been recently entered into between Ministry of Railways (MOR) and Ministry of Urban Development (MOUD) for integrated planning of redevelopment of railway stations in the cities included in the ‘SMART Cities’ and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme and the following 10 Railway stations have been identified to be redeveloped under the ‘SMART Cities’ scheme:


    Tirupati, Delhi Sarai Rohilla, Nellore, Madgaon, Lucknow, Gomtinagar, Kota, Thane New, Ernakulam Jn. and Puducherry.


    Station redevelopment projects are complex in nature and require detailed techno-economic feasibility studies and statutory clearances from local bodies. Therefore, no time frame for completion of the projects can be indicated, at this stage.


    Redevelopment of stations under ‘SMART Cities’ and ‘AMRUT’ schemes is planned through leveraging of commercial development of vacant land/air space in and around stations. Therefore, no funds have been earmarked for the purpose. Such projects shall generally be cost neutral to Railways.


    This information was made available in reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
