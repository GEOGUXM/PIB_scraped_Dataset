    Background:


    Government of India introduced the 'Ex-Andaman Political Prisoners Pension Scheme'in 1969 to honour the freedom fighters who had been incarcerated in the Cellular Jail at Port Blair. In 1972, to commemorate the 25 th Anniversary of Independence, a regular scheme for grant of freedom fighters' pension was introduced. Thereafter, with effect from 01.08.1980, a liberalized scheme, namely the 'SwatantrataSainikSamman Pension Scheme, 1980' is being implemented. From the financial year 2017-18 onwards, the nomenclature of the Scheme has been changed as 'SwatantrataSainikSammanYojana'. Total 1,71,617 freedom fighters and their eligible dependents have been sanctioned the central samman pension so far.


    At present 37,356 freedom fighters and their eligible dependent pensioners are covered under this scheme which includes 12,657 freedom fighters and 23,127 dependent spouses and 1572 daughters. The amount of pension was initially Rs.200/- per month and has been revised from time to time. With effect from 15.08.2016 the amount of pension for all categories of pensioners has been enhanced and the Dearness Relief system based on All India Consumer Price Index for Industrial workers hitherto applied to freedom fighter pensioners, had been discontinued and replaced by the Dearness Allowance system applicable to Central Government employees twice a year. The allowance for pensioners has been termed as "Dearness Relief". The present amount of pension for various categories of Central freedom fighter pensioners is as follows:
