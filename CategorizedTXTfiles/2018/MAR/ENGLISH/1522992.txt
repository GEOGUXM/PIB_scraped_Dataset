    Central Secretariat Manual of Office Procedure (CSMOP) lays down broad procedures for process management in the Central Secretariat. E-mail is one of the modes of communication provided in the Manual. The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances has reiterated instructions contained in the CSMOP from time to time stressing on the need of following its provisions including acknowledging the communication received from MPs within 15 days, followed by a reply within next 15 days of acknowledgement sent.


    Under the federal principle the State Governments have their own separate sets of Manuals of Office Procedure for their offices.


    This was stated by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space , Dr. Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
