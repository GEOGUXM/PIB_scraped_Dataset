    The Budget allocation for Defence has been increasing year over year, including 2018-19, wherein the Budget Estimate (BE) allocation at Rs.4,04,364.71 crore is Rs.44,510.59 crore over the BE 2017-18 allocation of Rs.3,59,854.12 crore.


    Modernization of Armed forces is a continuous process undertaken as per the extant Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) to keep the Forces in a state of readiness to meet operational and security challenges.


    Government is taking measures for modernization of the armed forces, through inducting of new equipment and upgrading of existing equipment and systems. The modernization projects are progressed as per approved Services Capital Acquisition Plans (SCAP) and Annual Acquisition Plans (AAP) in terms of extant Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP).


    The allocated funds are optimally and fully utilized towards operational activities. However, depending on budget allocation the schemes are reprioritized to ensure that urgent and critical capabilities are acquired without any compromise to operational preparedness of Defence services.


    This information was given by RakshaRajyaMantriDr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to ShriA.U. Singh Deoin Rajya Sabha today.
