      Posted On: 28 MAR 2018 3:43PM by PIB Delhi


    A navigation satellite, IRNSS-1I is scheduled for launch using PSLV launch vehicle in April 2018.


    Atomic clock of IRNSS-1A has become non-functional, but the satellite is being used for providing messaging services like disaster alerts, potential fishing zones information dissemination to fishermen, etc. IRNSS-1I will be added to NavIC constellation for providing intended navigation services.


    The atomic clocks used in NavIC and Galileo satellites are manufactured by M/s SpectraTime, Switzerland. Some of these clocks have failed in NavIC and Galileo. The reason for the failures has been analyzed and understood and the corrective actions have accordingly been taken on remaining clocks for upcoming satellites including IRNSS-1I.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
