    The Ministry of Tourism, on an ongoing and regular basis, holds consultations with private sector stakeholders in the tourism industry on various issues relating to the promotion and development of tourism in the country. The National Tourism Advisory Council which has been constituted to act as a ‘Think Tank’ to advise the Ministry on various policy matters relating to tourism, includes private sector stakeholders as its members.


    The Ministry of Tourism has launched an ‘Adopt a Heritage Scheme’ wherein Private Sector Companies, Public Sector Companies and Corporate individuals can adopt monuments, heritage and tourist sites across India and take up the responsibility of operations & maintenance of certain basic and advanced tourist amenities for making our heritage and tourism more sustainable.


    This information was given by Shri K. J. Alphons, Union Minister of State (I/C) for Tourism in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
