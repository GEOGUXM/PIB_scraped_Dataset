    Considering the security situation at the borders, the Government has adopted a multi-pronged approach for effective border domination to check trans-border crimes including infiltration along the international borders of the country. The steps taken in this regard, inter-alia, include:

      * Construction of fence, patrol roads, floodlighting systems and additional Border Out Posts.
      * Effective domination of the border by carrying out round the clock surveillance of the borders by patrolling, setting up of nakas (border ambushes) and by deploying observation posts all along the international borders of the country. The riverine segments of international borders of the country are being patrolled and dominated with the help of water crafts/speed boats/floating Border Out Posts (BOPs) of Border Security Force (BSF) water wings.
      * Introduction of force multipliers and Hi-Tech surveillance equipments fully equipped with day and night vision devices for further enhancing the border domination.
      * Vulnerability mapping of entire border has been made a continuous process based on which sensitive spots are identified and adequate measures are taken to further strengthen security in these spots.
      * It has also been decided to deploy technological solutions in the form of Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System(CIBMS), on a pilot basis to begin with, in different terrains on Indo-Pakistan Border and Indo-Bangladesh Border. The technological solutions are based on integration of sensors and surveillance equipments like radars, day and night vision cameras, etc. in a network architecture with command and control system.
      * Up-gradation of intelligence network and co-ordination with sister agencies, conduct of special operations along the border.
      * Raising the issues of infiltration from across the border during various meeting with counterpart countries i.e Company Commander Meeting, Commandant Level Meeting, Sector Commander Level Meeting, Frontier Level Meeting and Director-General Level Talks.

    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
