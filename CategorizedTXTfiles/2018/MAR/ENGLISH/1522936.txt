    This Ministry projects all the requirements posed by the Services to Ministry of Finance for favourable consideration. Ministry of Finance, being the Nodal Ministry for allocating funds to the Ministries, State Governments, etc. provides budget for Ministry of Defence taking into account resource envelope of the Government of India. The allocated funds are optimally and fully utilized towards operational requirements. However depending on the Budget allocation the schemes are reprioritized to ensure that urgent and critical capabilities are acquired without any compromise to operational preparedness of the Defence Services.
