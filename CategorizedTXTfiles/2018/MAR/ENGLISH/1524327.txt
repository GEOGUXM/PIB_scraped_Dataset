    The Indian Air Force inventory is a mix of old and new equipment. Ageing of equipment is a natural process and is dealt with through proper maintenance, obsolescence management, upgrades and acquisition of new equipment without compromising safety. The MiG-21 and MiG-27 UPG aircraft of Indian Air Force will be phased out on completion of their Total Calendar Life / Total Technical Life by 2024.


    Phasing out of aircraft and their replacement with new generation aircraft depends upon national security, strategic objectives and operational requirements of the defence forces and is reviewed by the Government from time to time. This is a continuous process.


    Every aircraft which is launched by Indian Air Force is fully airworthy. Further, the details of aircraft accidents during last three years and the current year (upto 04.03.2018) are as follows:
