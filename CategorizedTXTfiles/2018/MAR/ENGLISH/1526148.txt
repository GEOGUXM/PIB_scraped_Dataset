    Higher Education Financing Agency (HEFA) has been set up by the Government to mobilize funds from the market as per requirements of the centrally funded higher educational institutions set up in all the States of the country including Rajasthan. The funding is being made to centrally funded higher educational institutions without any State-wise targets by HEFA.


    An Announcement in the Budget 2018-19 has been made to step up investments in research and related infrastructure in premier educational institutions, including health institutions, to launch a major initiative named ‘‘Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in Education (RISE) by 2022’’ with a total investment of Rs.1,00,000 crore in next four years by structuring HEFA.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Dr. Satya Pal Singh today in a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question.
