      Opening of Office on Holidays
      Posted On: 21 MAR 2018 4:26PM by PIB Delhi


    As per Fundamental Rules (F.R.) No.11, the whole time of a Government servant is at the disposal of the Government which pays him, he may be employed in any manner required by proper authority without claim for additional remuneration.


    Sometimes with a view to meeting the exigencies of work such as when a Government business has to be transacted immediately or a deadline is to be met, the Head of Office can, in the interests of public service, take a decision to keep the offices open fully or partially even on public holidays. The staff who are deployed on official duty on public holidays are, however, compensated by granting them compensatory leave.


    Need for laying down procedure for registering complaints in case of any Government/private office remaining open on public holidays has not been felt.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions and Prime Ministerâ€™s Office, Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply to question i n the Lok Sabha today.
