    The CAPFs have informed that the force personnel proceeded on voluntary retirement and resignation from CAPFs/AR mainly due to various personal and domestic reasons, including children/family issues, health/illness of self or family, social/ family obligations and commitments etc. Some personnel also sought voluntary retirement to enjoy a static life as well as pensionary benefits after completing 20 years of service.


    The personnel who intend to proceed on voluntary retirement or submit resignation are given personal hearing/counseling by their Controlling Officers. Voluntary Retirement/ resignation is essentially a personal choice. However, improvement in the working condition of officers/men in CAPFs is a continuous endeavour. Some of the measures taken for improving the working conditions are as per details given below:


    Steps taken by the Government to check attrition of CAPF personnel


    i) Transparent policies pertaining to transfer and leave of CAPFs and AR personnel. The hospitalization period due to injuries while on duty is treated as on duty. Choice posting is considered to the extent possible after the personnel served in hard area.


    (ii) Regular interaction of officers with troops to find out and redress their grievances.


    (iii) Officers/personnel due for retirement are considered for terminal posting.


    (iv) Ensuring adequate rest and relief by regulating the duty hours.


    (v) Improving living conditions for troops, providing adequate recreational/ entertainment, sports, communication facilities etc. Crèche facility is also provided at various establishments (where feasible) to facilitate the female employees.


    (vi) Facility of retention of government accommodation at the place of last posting (for keeping the family) while posted in NE State, J&K and LWE affected areas (except State Capitals).


    (vii) Providing better medical facilities, also organizing talks with specialists to address their personal and psychological concerns and organizing Meditation & Yoga routinely for better stress management.


    (viii) Adequately compensating the troops deployed in difficult areas.


    (ix) Other welfare measures like facility of Central Police Canteen (CPC), scholarship for wards etc. Also air courier service has been provided to CAPF personnel deployed in NE States, J&K and LWE affected areas as welfare measure.


    (x) Designating retired CAPF personnel as ex-CAPF personnel for better identity and community recognition.


    (xi) Promotions are released regularly to eligible personnel as & when the vacancies arise. Financial benefits under Modified Assured Career Progression (MACP) are given in case promotion does not take place for want of vacancies at 10, 20 & 30 years of service.


    Besides above, implementation of suitable model for improvement of working conditions of CAPFs & AR is a continuous process and instructions in this regard are issued from time to time by this Ministry.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.
