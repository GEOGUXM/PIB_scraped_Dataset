      Improvement In Surveillance
      Posted On: 07 MAR 2018 5:48PM by PIB Delhi


    Close surveillance on anti-social elements, regular and intensive drives conducted by RPF have resulted in 18.84 % more arrests in the year 2017 as compared to the year 2015. Zone-wise number of persons arrested by the RPF in the last three years (2015, 2016 & 2017) is appended. The statistics of Northern Railway includes arrests made in Delhi.


    Railway Protection Force (RPF) has been empowered under the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act to arrest and prosecute offenders related to Railway Property. RPF personnel have also been empowered under the Railways Act to arrest and prosecute offenders involved in offences specified under 29 sections of the Railways Act which are related to alarm chain pulling, unauthorised hawking and vending, touting, trespassing, travelling on roof and foot-board of train, travelling of male persons in coaches reserved for female passengers etc. 0.59% of total arrests are related to offences under the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act and 99.41% are related to the Railways Act.


    Special emphasis is being given to improve living conditions of RPF/RPSF personnel by providing barracks at important locations and upgrading basic amenities in the existing barracks at par with running rooms. During the year 2018-19, works to the tune of ` 59 Cr. have been sanctioned for construction of barracks. All the Divisional Railway Managers have been advised to conduct inspection of all the RPF barracks and submit status report. Measures initiated to strengthen RPF also include installation of CCTV cameras at Railway stations/trains, upgradation of security helpline No. 182, development of security App., soft skill training to RPF personnel, etc.
