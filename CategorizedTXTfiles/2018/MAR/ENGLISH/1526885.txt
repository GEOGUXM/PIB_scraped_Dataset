    Special Forces Training School (SFTS) is celebrating its Silver Jubilee on 01 Apr 2018. The School owes its origin to a humble beginning on 01 Apr 1993 where it was established as a Special Forces Training Wing (SFTW) to impart training to the three Para Commando battalions. The aim of raising this School was to provide unique and specialist training which was not available in any other training institution. The School over the years has transformed into a Cat ‘A’ establishment where it trains approximately 800 Officers, JCOs/ORs yearly.


    The essence of training at SFTS is ‘Walk The Talk’ where absolute professional competence is built through a practical on ground training. The students are trained to be confident and develop a strong winning attitude for carrying out special operations in the entire spectrum of contemporary warfare. SFTS is a Centre of Excellence (COE) for Special Forces’ Training and is also nominated as Nodal Agency for training with Special Forces of Friendly Foreign Countries (FFC).


    The motto of the School is “ Sauryam Daksham Yuddhe” which means “Courage and Competence in War” . Owing to the developments made in training and infrastructure, conduct of complex exercises like water para jumps and maintaining a high level of training standards, the School was awarded Army Training Command (ARTRAC) Army Commander’s Citation on 26 Jan 2018.
