    Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, Road Transport & Highways and Shipping, Shri Nitin Gadkari has called for public participation in water conservation efforts of the government. He said, water conservation is the key to all round advancement of the society. Shri Gadkari stressed upon enhanced afforestation, which leads to employment generation and prosperity.


    Addressing a FICCI summit on role of water in farmersâ€™income in New Delhi today, the Minister cited the example of power plants on the banks of river Ganga. He said, there are 24 power plants, which draw water from the river. Shri Gadkari said, these plants can be provided cleaned sewage water for power production. Similarly, railways and agriculture can also utilise such water, thereby reducing burden on fresh water supply.


    The Minister also suggested cost cutting in desalination of sea water so that not only drinking water supply improves, but also at a much cheaper rate.
