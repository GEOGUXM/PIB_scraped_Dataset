    Source-Coal Statistics of CCO)


    Based on the coal demand projected by NITI Aayog and Ministry of Coal, project reports (PRs)/ Mining Plans are prepared for optimal development of the coal block with the available mining technology suitable for the block. The list of project reports prepared by CMPDI for the subsidiaries of Coal India Limited during last 3 years is enclosed as Annexure.


    The issue of Coal Regulatory Authority has to be examined keeping in view the legislative developments that took place after the cancellation of the coal blocks allocated through the Screening Committee route since 1993 by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in 2014. The decision in the matter is yet to be taken.


    As an alternative energy source, the Government has up-scaled the target of Renewable Energy capacity to 175 GW by the year 2022, which includes 100 GW from solar, 60 GW from wind, 10 GW from Bio-power and 5 GW from Small Hydro power. So far a total of 64.31 GW capacity has been installed through the implementation of various renewable energy schemes/ programmes upto 31st January 2018 which includes 32.88 GW from Wind, 18.45 GW from Solar, 8.53 GW from Bio-power and 4.45 GW from Small Hydro Power. To promote the production of renewable energy through various schemes/programmes, the Government has taken various steps which inter alia includes:-

     1. Announced a cumulative target of 175 GW renewable energy based electric installed capacity by 2022.
     2. Issued guidelines for procurement of solar and wind power through tariff based competitive bidding process.
     3. Declared Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) up to the year 2018-19.
     4. Declare Renewable Generation Obligation on new coal/lignite based thermal plants.
     5. Notified National Offshore Wind Energy Policy.
     6. Notified policy for Repowering of Wind Power Projects.
     7. Notified standards for deployment of solar photovoltaic systems/devices.
     8. Issued order for waiving the Inter State Transmission System charges and losses for inter-state sale of solar and wind power for projects to be commissioned by March 2019.
