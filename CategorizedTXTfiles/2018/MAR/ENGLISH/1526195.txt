    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, in his message on the eve of World Tuberculosis Day, which is observed every year on March 24, has said:-


    “I am happy to learn that the World Tuberculosis Day is being observed every year on 24th March, 2018 to commemorate the day Dr. Robert Koch discovered the Tuberculosis (TB) bacteria in 1882.


    TB continues to be one of the biggest public health challenges in our country. The time has come for all of us to join hands in a historic movement to eliminate TB from India by 2025.


    On the occasion of World Tuberculosis Day, I call upon all stakeholders to come together for this fight against Tuberculosis and to undertake all the necessary steps to achieve the goal of zero TB deaths.


    Let us all work together to achieve a TB-free India”.


    Hindi version of the message is attached.
