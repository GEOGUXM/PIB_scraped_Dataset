The index for ‘Manufacture of Textiles’ group rose by 0.6 percent to 113.7 (provisional) from 113.0 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of weaving & finishing of textiles, cotton yarn, synthetic yarn and manufacture of made-up textile articles, except apparel (1% each). However, the price of manufacture of other textiles (1%) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Wood and of Products of Wood and Cork ‘ group rose by 0.1 percent to 130.9 (provisional) from 130.8 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of wooden splint (2%) and lamination wooden sheets/veneer sheets and wooden box/crate (1% each). However, the price of plywood block boards, wooden block-compressed or not and wooden panel (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Paper and Paper Products’ group declined by 1.2 percent to 120.0 (provisional) from 121.4 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of corrugated sheet box (9%), pulp board (5%) and map litho paper, tissue paper, paper carton/box, duplex paper, base paper and card board (1% each). However, the price of hard board (5%), newsprint (3%), paper for printing & writing, laminated paper and bristle paper board (2% each) and press board, poster paper, corrugated paper board and kraft paper (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Basic Metals’ group rose by 2.0 percent to 107.9 (provisional) from 105.8 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of rails and pig iron (6% each), sponge iron/direct reduced iron (DRI) and ms pencil ingots (5% each), ms wire rods, gp/gc sheet, angles, channels, sections, steel (coated/not) and hot rolled (HR) coils & sheets, including narrow strip (4% each), ferrosilicon, other ferro alloys, cold rolled (CR) coils & sheets, including narrow strip and alloy steel wire rods (3% each), brass metal/sheet/coils, lead ingots, bars, blocks, plates, MS bright bars, copper metal/copper rings and mild steel (ms) blooms (2% each) and copper shapes-bars/rods/plates/strips, cast iron, castings, stainless steel bars & rods, including flats, steel cables, ferrochrome, ferromanganese, galvanized iron pipes, stainless steel tubes, stainless steel coils, strips & sheets, aluminium disk and circles and alumnium foil (1% each). However, the price of steel forgings-rough (1%) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Electrical Equipment’ group declined by 0.6 percent to 109.4 (provisional) from 110.1 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of solenoid valve (6%), transformer and jelly filled cables (4% each), electric switch and connector/plug/socket/holder-electric (2% each) and insulator, dry cells such as torch light batteries, electric & other meters and electric switch gear control/starter (1% each). However, the price of electrical resistors (except heating resistors) and insulating & flexible wire (4% each), electrical relay/conductor and acsr conductors (3% each), electric welding machine and aluminium/alloy conductor (2% each) and rotor/magneto rotor assembly, copper wire, domestic gas stove and aluminium wire (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Machinery and Equipment’ group rose by 1.5 percent to 109.7 (provisional) from 108.1 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of agricultural tractors (16%), pressure vessel and tank for fermentation & other food processing (10%), roller mill (raymond) (9%), hydraulic pump, lathes, air filters, mining, quarrying & metallurgical machinery/parts and air or vacuum pump (2% each) and industrial valve, roller & ball bearings, manufacture of bearings, gears, gearing & driving elements, separator, sewing machines and injection pump (1% each). However, the price of cranes (12%), solar power system (solar panel & attachable equipment) (6%), open end spinning machinery and filtration equipment (4% each), chemical equipment & system, excavator and packing machine (2% each) and drilling machine, gasket kit, harvesters, oil pump and pharmaceutical machinery (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Motor Vehicles, Trailers and Semi-Trailers’ group rose by 0.4 percent to 111.1 (provisional) from 110.7 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of brake pad/brake liner/brake block/brake rubber, others (5%), engine (2%) and seat for motor vehicles, piston ring/piston & compressor, head lamp and body (for commercial motor vehicles) (1% each). However, the price of cylinder liners (2%) and wheels/wheels & parts, chassis of different vehicle types, silencer & damper and shafts of all kinds (1% each) declined.
