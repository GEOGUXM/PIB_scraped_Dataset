    A Border Protection Grid (BPG) along the Indo-Pakistan and Indo-Bangladesh Border has already been set up. The BPG comprising the State authorities and all other stakeholders will continuously evaluate threats from across the border, observe and analyze crime patterns and other suspicious activities and will formulate an appropriate response mechanism. The Grid will have five layers viz. elements ahead of the border fence, physical border infrastructure, Border Guarding Force, Intelligence Grid and Police. As the strengthening of border is continuous process, the implementation of BPG on other borders, will be taken up in due course.
