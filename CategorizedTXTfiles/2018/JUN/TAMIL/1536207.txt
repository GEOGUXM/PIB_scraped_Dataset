    “History of mankind has seen various changes in the planet from ice age. Then why we should be concerned about the climate change is because this is not created by the nature but by human. We can’t change or stop natural calamities like Tsunami, but climate change which is manmade can be mitigated and solution can be found”, Minister added.


    “Climate Change is a serious threat to human being. For example every nation is situated near to the sea. Ice in Antartica has started melting. This will result in increase in the sea level and will also alter the temperature of the ocean. This will not only disturb the bio-diversity in the ocean but also the entire bio-diversity of the planet” minister cautioned.


    Just 2 degree Celsius rise in temperature will cause distress in farming which create food crisis. And the climate change will worsen the water crisis issue. He called upon every individual to take action in their capacity for the manmade problem, climate change. He also briefed about the various agreements and pact signed by various nation for the environmental cause.


    Minister hailed the writer for writing a book which talks not only the problems but also the solutions.
