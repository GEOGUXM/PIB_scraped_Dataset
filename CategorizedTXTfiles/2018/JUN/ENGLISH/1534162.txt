    In the run up to the World Environment Day 2018, National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) in association with Yes Bank organised a cleanliness drive at Kalindi Kunj ghat on river Yamuna in New Delhi today. The focus during the cleanliness drive remained on freeing the ghat from plastic waste along with other solid waste.


    This is the third time in the past two months NMCG has organised a Swachhta drive at Kalindi Kunj ghat. Volunteers from NMCG and other stakeholders, led by Director General, NMCG, Shri Rajiv Ranjan Mishra cleaned the Kalindi Kunj ghat of plastic and other solid waste. Cleaning of Yamuna is part of the Namami Gange programme as it is the tributary of River Ganga. More than 300 officials from different organisations participated in the event. These include NMCG, Yes Bank, World Bank, GIZ, IL&FS, Jamia Millia Islamia, South Delhi Municipal Corporation and other departments. Around 15 trucks full of waste collected from the ghat and the river was transported for proper disposal.


    Director General, NMCG, Shri Rajiv Ranjan Mishra said on the occasion: “It is heartening to see the enthusiastic involvement of so many other departments and local people. While I thank all who participated in today’s the event, I request the people of Delhi to join hands with us in more numbers to clean River Yamuna. The involvement of each and every one of us is indispensable to clean Ganga mission.”
