    On June 30, 2018, livestock of sheep and goat will be exported for the first time to Sharjah from Nagpur airport. Around 1 lakh sheep and goat will be exported over a period of three months from the Nagpur airport. This project is taking off due to the joint efforts of Multi-modal International Cargo Hub and Airport at Nagpur (MIHAN), Air India, Agriculture Ministry and Commerce Ministry. The export of livestock will benefit farmers of the Vidarbha region which is witnessing farmer’s suicides and in order to explore new avenues to improve farmer’s income this project has been undertaken.


    Shepherd's and farmers of the region will greatly benefit from this and may consider Sheep and Goat rearing as a side business along with farming. When there is drought or when the farmer is in need of money he will be able to sell the sheep and goat. Women too can take this up as a business and make it a source of earning.


    On 30 th June 2018, Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis, Union Minister of Road Transport & Highways, Nitin Gadkari and Union Minister of Industry & Commerce, Suresh Prabhu will be present when the first batch of livestock for export leaves from Nagpur.
