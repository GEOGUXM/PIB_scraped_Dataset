    In response to certain reports appearing recently in the media regarding ‘Adopt a Heritage’ Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs) pertaining to Red Fort being ‘put on hold’, the Ministry of Culture has clarified that ‘Adopt a Heritage’ Scheme of the Government of India is making good progress. The scheme is being implemented by the Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Culture and Archaeological Survey of India. Secretary, Ministry of Culture, Shri Raghvendra Singh today said that under ‘Adopt a Heritage’ Scheme, three MoUs have already been signed and six are at an advanced stage and 31 more Adarsh Monuments are enlisted for coverage under the scheme. The Project aims to develop synergy among all partners to effectively promote “responsible tourism”, he added.


    The schemes aims to involve public sector companies, private sector companies and corporate citizens/individuals to take up the responsibility for making our heritage and tourism more sustainable through development, operation and maintenance of world-class tourist infrastructure and amenities at ASI/ State heritage sites and other important tourist sites in India.


    The Government has carried out Critical Gap Analysis in respect of the heritage monuments of importance and identified public conveniences and civic amenities which can be provided in these monuments with the involvement of corporate sector, PSUs etc. under the CSR activities to enhance visitor experience.


    The project primarily focuses on providing basic amenities that includes cleanliness, public conveniences, drinking water, ease of access for differently abled and senior citizens, standardized signage, illumination and advanced amenities such as surveillance system, night viewing facilities, tourism facilitation center and an enhanced tourism experience that will result in more tourist footfalls, both domestic and foreign.


    The response to the project has been very encouraging as the agencies who have come forward for adoption includes not only public and private industry/individuals but also schools and law firms.
