    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:


         1. Crude oil production by ONGC during May, 2018 was 1840.93 TMT which is 1.77% lower than the monthly target and 4.82% lower when compared with May, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-May, 2018 was 3618.26 TMT which is 1.18% lower than target for the period and lower by 4.31% than production during corresponding period of last year. Shortfall in production is largely attributable to closure of wells to facilitate activities the under project ‘Life extension of well platform’.


         1. Crude oil production by OIL during May, 2018 was 285.02 TMT which is 4.14% lower than monthly target and 1.04% lower when compared with May, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-May, 2018 was 559.36 TMT which is 3.18% lower than target for the period and 0.42% lower than production during the corresponding period of last year. Major reason for lower production is less than planned contribution from work over wells and drilling wells.


         1. Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during May, 2018 was 881.89 TMT which is 0.4% higher than the monthly target and 0.56% higher than May, 2017. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-May, 2018 was 1745.23 TMT which is 1.49% higher than target for the period and 2.93% higher than the production during the corresponding period of last year.


    Natural Gas

     1. Natural gas production during May, 2018 was 2728.04 MMSCM which is 7.29% lower than the target for the month and 1.47% lower when compared with May, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production during April-May, 2018 was 5391.01 MMSCM which is 6.13% lower than target for the period but 1.67% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II . Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of May, 2018 and cumulatively for the period April-May, 2018 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

    Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production


         1. Natural gas production by ONGC during May, 2018 was 1981.60 MMSCM which is 6.31% lower than the monthly target but 0.93% higher when compared with May, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC during April-May, 2018 was 3953.64 MMSCM which is 4.51% lower than the cumulative target but 5.31% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year.


         1. Natural gas production by OIL during May, 2018 was 227.44 MMSCM which is 14.58% lower than the monthly target and 7.12% lower than May, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-May, 2018 was 448.86 MMSCM which is 13.84% lower than the cumulative target and 7.67% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * Less well head production potential of high producing wells of Deohal area, due to corrosion of downhole production tubing.

      * Low upliftment of gas by tea gardens of Moran area.

         1. Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during May, 2018 was 519.0 MMSCM which is 7.49% lower than the monthly target and 7.38% lower when compared with May, 2017. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-May, 2018 was 988.51 MMSCM which is 8.63% lower than the cumulative target and 6.90% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * KG-DWN-98/3 (RIL): Closure of 2 wells in D1D3 and 1 well in MA field. Well B6 ceased to flow on 30.04.2018 due to low reservoir pressure.

      * Raniganj East (Essar): Few wells closed for planned maintenance and refrac jobs. Major customer 'Matix' under operational shutdown.
      * Sohagpur West (RIL): Underperformance of CBM wells.

     1. Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)


    Refinery production during May, 2018 was 22241.10 TMT which is 1.88% higher than the target for the month and 6.79% higher when compared with May, 2017. Cumulative production during April-May, 2018 was 42093.93 TMT which is 0.21% lower than the target for the period and 3.04% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III . Company-wise production for the month of May, 2018 and cumulatively for the period April-May, 2018 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

    Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production


         1. CPSE Refineries’ production during May, 2018 was 12792.67 TMT which is 0.89% higher than the target for the month and 2.73% higher when compared with May, 2017. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-May, 2018 was 24427.92 TMT which is 1.04% higher than the target for the period and 3.42% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


     1. IOCL, Paradip: Throughput lower due to RCO pump high vibration issue.

     2. IOCL, Gujarat: Throughput lower due to HGU interruption.
     3. IOCL, Haldia: Throughput lower due to DHDS shutdown for catalyst change.
     4. HPCL, Visakh: Throughput l ower due to unplanned CDU shutdown.
     5. NRL, Numaligarh: Throughput lower due DCU shutdown on account of increase in furnace pressure leading to VR ullage constraint and thereby lesser crude throughput.
     6. MRPL, Mangalore: Crude cut for the month due to unprecedented heavy rain fall on 29 th May, 18 resulted in submerging of drives in Oil Movement & Storage (OM&S) and effluent treatment plants. Submergence of drives in OM&S has affected the crude & secondary units processing rates.

    3.2 Production in JV refineries during May, 2018 was 1691.43 TMT which is 11.20% higher than the target for the month and 166.16% higher when compared with May, 2017. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-May, 2018 was 3192.08 TMT which is 9.77% higher than the target for the period but 58.97% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year. The major reason for high variation in production was major turnaround underway in HMEL refinery during April - June, 2017.


    3.3 Production in private refineries during May, 2018 was 7757.0 TMT which is higher by 1.66% than the target for the month and 0.24% higher when compared with May, 2017. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-May, 2018 was 14473.94 TMT which is 4.13% lower than the target for the period and lower by 4.94% compared to production during corresponding period of last year.


    3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of May, 2018 and cumulatively for the period April-May, 2018 vis-à-vis April-May, 2017 are given at Annexures - IV and V respectively.
