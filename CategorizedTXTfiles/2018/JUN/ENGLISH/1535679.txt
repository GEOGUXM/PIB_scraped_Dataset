    The Foundation of stone of “Auxiliary Production Unit and State-of-the-Art Artificial Limbs Fitting Centre” of Artificial Limbs Manufacturing Corporation of India (ALIMCO) under Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD), Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment was laid by Shri Manohar Lal, Chief Minister of Haryana and Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar, Minister of State for Social Justice & Empowerment at a function at village Nawada, Tigaon (Ballabhgarh), Faridabad, Haryana today.


    There has been an ever increasing demand from the Divyangjan about the difficulty being faced by them in visiting Kanpur to avail facilities of evaluation, measurements and fitment of assistive devices from ALIMCO Hqrs. at Kanpur. Diversification of rehabilitation and fitment of assistive devices services to other areas will facilitate Divyangjans to cover less a distance for acquiring these devices.


    Establishment of the State of the Art Rehabilitation Centre at Faridabad would substantially reduce botheration of long travel for Divyangjans from J&K, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan and to some extent MP and Chhattisgarh. Once established, the production centre at Faridabad will not only reinforce capacity of the Corporation but also provide other rehabilitation services like limbs fitting, disabled help centres, awareness generation about other schemes for empowerment of Divyangjan in NCR and neighbouring states of the country. Apart from facilities for filment of State-of-the-art Artificial Limbs, Manufacturing of Tricycle, Wheelchair, Motorized Tricycle, Walker, Crutches, and Walking Stick etc. will also be undertaken in this centre.
