      Posted On: 28 JUN 2018 1:47PM by PIB Delhi

     1. Monsoon Advance:
          + Southwest monsoon has further advanced into some more parts of Gujarat region, most parts of East Rajasthan, some parts of West Rajasthan, entire Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi, remaining parts of West Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh & Punjab.
          + The Northern Limit of Monsoon passes through Lat. 21°N/ Long. 60°E, Lat. 21°N/ Long. 65°E, Veraval, Amreli, Ahmedabad, Jodhpur, Bikaner and Lat. 29°N/ Long. 73°E (Fig.1).
          + Conditions are favourable for further advance of Southwest Monsoon into remaining parts of north Arabian Sea, Gujarat, Rajasthan and thus the entire country during next 2-3 days.
          + Wide spread rainfall activity observed over northwest India with heavy rainfall at isolated places.
