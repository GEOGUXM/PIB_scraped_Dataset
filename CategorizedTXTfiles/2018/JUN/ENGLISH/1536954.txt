      Cdr Abhilash Tomy readies for another circumnavigation
      Posted On: 28 JUN 2018 12:42PM by PIB Delhi


    Cdr Abhilash Tomy is ready for his second solo circumnavigation of the globe in a non-motorised sailboat. He sailed into Les Sables d'Olonne in France a few days ago, in time for the July 1 flag-off of the 30,000-mile Golden Globe Race. There are 18 skippers at the start line and Cdr Tomy of the Indian Navy is a special invitee at the race.


    The race is being held to commemorate 50 years since it was held for the first and last time, which saw Sir Robin Knox-Johnston's successfully completing the voyage in 312 days, to become the first human to finish solo, unassisted and non stop circumnavigation of the world.


    The biggest challenge at the GGR is to have equipment, tools and boat which resembles the one used by Sir Johntson,despite the change in technology. Navigation will have to be done looking at celestial objects using physical maps. Communication with the outside world will also be limited as the lone satellite phone is for use in medical emergency alone. Cdr Tomy had first circumnavigated the globe in 2012-13, becoming the first Indian to achieve the feat by sailing for 151 days in INS Mhadei.


    Starting from Les Sables d'Olonne, skippers will go south till Cape of Good Hope, continue sailing eastward in the southern hemisphere to pass the international dateline, and pass Cape of Horn to start sailing north in the Atlantic Ocean for the final leg. Cdr Tomy is aiming to complete the race in 311 days, one day less than Sir Johntson's timing.


    He will be sailing in the 10-metre 'Thuriya', whose design is similar to Sir Johntson's boat 'Suhaili',which was incidentally manufactured in Colaba, Mumbai. "Thuriya" has been built at Goa at Ratnakar Dandekar's Aquarius Shipyard. Cdr Tomy has supplies consisting of specially-prepared food items, and fresh water in the limited space on board.


    Before sailing out for Les Sables d'Olonne, there were a series of events held in UK's Flymouth, from where the first race was flagged, where Sir Johntson was also present. In the two weeks to July 1, mandatory checks, including ones on safety, are being carried out and the sailors are getting the boat ready for the long-haul voyage.


    Cdr Tomy is being supported by the Indian Navy and Aquaris Shipyard for the race, while Cdr (Retd) Dilip Donde, the first Indian to circumnavigate the world with stops, will be overseeing as the base manager.


    Explaining the journey that awaits him, Cdr Abhilash said, "At the Sagarparikrama (the first circumnavigation), I had used GPS-based maps and other satellite-based technologies. But at GGR, I have to make do with a compass, printed maps, and star and planetary movements. There is a solitary HF radio set for contact. The size of the boat limits the possibility to carry water. Sir Robin had used rain water and used it, I will have to do the same. There is no help from the outside world throughout the race."


    Here is a quick QnA with Cdr Abhilash:


    1. Where are you now? Plan / schedule for next 8 days?


    I was in a place called Medemblik in the Netherlands preparing the boat for the circumnavigation. I sailed out from there on the 5th of June alone and made it to Falmouth in the UK by the 10th of Jun. I was there as part of the Golden Globe Race (GGR) race activities such as race briefing etc. I left from there on the 14th morning and reached Les Sables dâ€™Olonne, France on 17th June. The sail to Les Sables was with all the other entrants. There was a friendly race called the SITRAN cup.


    The GGR race will start from Les Sables on 01 Jul. During our stay in Les Sables for next 10 days, we will have safety briefings, safety inspections, media, introductions, events etc. and of course boat preparations.


    2. About Boat & other preparation, what is done, what is pending


    Most of the work is over. We had the first safety check yesterday and a few things need to be looked into as per the race organisers. Buying food is pending. And also buying some stuff such as stationary, toiletries etc.


    3. What are you carrying with you for this expedition


    Lot of things are to be carried! It is an endless list.


    - Almost 1000 meals, including MTR, freeze dry and tinned food


    - A suit of 13 sails


    - Two sextants


    - Two taffrail logs


    - Two automatic watches


    - Three trackers


    - Two satellite phones


    - Lot of charts


    - Lot of books


    - An MF direction finder


    - Two Short wave radio sets


    - Lot of communication equipment


    - Four 10 kg gas cylinders


    - Lot of spares for the engine etc


    - About 300 litres of water


    - About 140 litres of fuel


    There is also a major emphasis on safety due to which we are taking a lot of safety equipment with us. This is almost four times more than what i carried in my last round the world. There is also a lot of emphasis through regular briefings, safety checks etc from the organisers. MSOS will be providing the medical support while we are at sea.


    4. About Sponsors


    My entry is mainly sponsored by the Indian Navy. Aquarius Shipyard Ltd and Goa Shipyard Ltd are important supporter and sponsor. Equipment sponsors include Elcome (communications), Windpilot (autopilot), Decathlon (clothing and Jellyfish Water Sports (water maker)


    5. How can people track your status


    There are various ways to tract my status


    - There will be 3 hourly position updates on GGR website


    - There will be weekly sound bites on GGR website


    - There will be one way text messages from me being posted on GGR website
