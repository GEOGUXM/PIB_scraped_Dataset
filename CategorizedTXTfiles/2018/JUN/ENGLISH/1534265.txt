      Compensation for loss of milch animals due to cross-border firing in J&K increased
      Posted On: 04 JUN 2018 3:40PM by PIB Delhi


    Govt of India has enhanced the compensation for loss of milch animals due to corss-border firing in Jammu & Kashmir to Rs. 50,000/- per milch animal. Border areas of Jammu and Kashmir are facing losses of livestock, crops, houses etc. due to corss-border firing from across the border.


    It may be recalled that the Govt. of India had announced expenditure for relief camps and compensation for losses of houses, crops, livestock at NDRF rates to the victims of cross-border firing in the month of December, 2017. It was, however, observed that compensation for loss of milch animals which was Rs. 30,000/- per milch animal, was quite inadequate compared to actual value of milch animals. Considering the problem of border-residents, Govt of India has increased the compensation amount to Rs. 50,000/-.


    These claims will initially be paid to the victims by the State Government of J&K after evaluating the actual loss. The amount will then be reimbursed by the Ministry of Home Affairs under Security Related Expenditure (Relief & Rehabilitation) Scheme. Orders in this regard have been issued to J&K Govt. on 1 st June, 2018.
