In this regard, he suggested the Council to pursue the matter with the Central Government for seeking relaxation of this condition in the case of Safai Karamcharis. After listening to the demands of the Safai Karamcharis present in the meeting, Shri Zala directed the Council for converting Temporary Muster Roll workers into Regular Muster Roll and Regular Muster Roll into Permanent workers.
