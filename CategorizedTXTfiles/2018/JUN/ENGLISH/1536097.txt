    The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that Yoga is a holistic approach towards health and well-being with physical, emotional and spiritual dimensions to it. Addressing the gathering while participating in the International Day of Yoga 2018 celebrations, in Mumbai today, he said that the ancient science of Yoga is India’s invaluable gift to the modern world. The Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Shri Devendra Fadnavis and other dignitaries were present on the occasion.


    Quoting Sage Patanjali who compiled the first yoga philosophy, the Vice President said that Yoga helps a person to control his or her own random thoughts and allows achieving stillness, a calmness that creates inner harmony.


    The Vice President said that Yoga has nothing to do with religion and it is a holistic science embodying the basic principle of organic, interconnectedness of different facets of life. It is unfortunate that some people attribute religious overtones to this ancient scientific system, he added.


    The Vice President called on people to make Yoga a part of daily routine to combat modern day health problems. He said that the time has come to introduce yoga as part of school curriculum so that India becomes a nation of healthy and happy people in the coming years.


    The Vice President Yoga promotes concentration and focused attention. Apart from enhancing physical and mental agility, Yoga practice makes a person to adopt a balanced attitude towards life at all times, he added.


    Outlining the importance of Yoga in daily life, the Vice President said that the worrisome trend of youngsters resorting to extreme steps like ending their lives can be curbed if they develop sense of equanimity and calmness of mind, which can be developed through yoga and meditation.


    Following is the text of Vice President's address :


      * "I am happy to be with all of you here on International Yoga Day. This is a momentous occasion, a moment of celebration. This is a celebration of dedication to the ancient Indian Science of Yoga.

      * Yoga is a holistic approach to well being. It has physical, emotional and spiritual dimensions.
      * Sage Patanjali who compiled the first yoga philosophy defines yoga as an ability to control one’s own random thoughts and achieve a stillness, a calmness that creates inner harmony. This philosophy is usually referred to as Ashtanga Yoga.
      * Yoga is a holistic science embodying the basic principle of organic, interconnectedness of different facets of life. It is not a mere set of exercises. It goes beyond the physical exercises and connects the body with thought processes. It seeks to build a lifestyle that values calmness, harmony and positive thinking. It is probably one of the most effective therapies for many psycho-somatic disorders.
      * It advocates purity of mind, speech and body, contentment, acceptance of others, perseverance, self study, self reflection, contemplation of the supreme being.
      * The word Yoga is derived from two roots. One signifying “connection” and the second signifying “concentration”. It connects physical health with mental equilibrium and emotional tranquility. It promotes concentration and focused attention. Apart from enhancing physical and mental agility, yoga practice makes a person to adopt a balanced attitude towards life at all times.
      * The worrisome trend of youngsters resorting to extreme steps like ending their lives can be curbed if they develop sense of equanimity and calmness of mind, which can be developed through yoga and meditation.
      * It is a matter of concern that the WHO had recently stated in its report that 61 percent of all deaths in India every year are because of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), which include cardiovascular diseases , cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases, among others.
      * Yoga should become a part and parcel of our daily routine to combat the modern-day health problems, both physical and mental. There is also a misconception that Yoga is only a sort of physical exercise meant to help the fitness of an individual. Nothing could be farther than this. It is a holistic system where the mind and body act in unison and get completely rejuvenated as physical postures, breathing exercises and meditation help in overall well-being of an individual. And of course Yoga also helps in the spiritual quest of an individual through understanding of the inner Self and achieving complete peace with the surroundings.
      * Yoga adopts a holistic approach towards health and well-being. While Yoga has nothing to do with religion , some people unfortunately attribute religious overtones to this ancient scientific system.
      * Thanks to the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, the United Nations declared June 21 as the International Yoga Day and is now being celebrated across the globe. The ancient science of Yoga is India’s invaluable gift to the modern world .
      * The time has come to introduce yoga as part of school curriculum so that India becomes a nation of healthy and happy people in the coming years."
