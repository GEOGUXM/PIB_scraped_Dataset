      Army Persons to buy Personal Clothing
      Posted On: 07 JUN 2018 6:54PM by PIB Delhi


    The Seventh Pay Commission has awarded monetary compensation to jawans for allowing purchase of personal clothing items of uniform to be purchased under arrangement to be made by the Army. An annual remuneration of Rs 10,000/- has been paid to all jawans in lieu of selected items of personal clothing. Accordingly, Army has made arrangements for purchase of quality cloth to be made available through CSD outlets and stitching to be carried out under unit arrangements or any other means that the individual jawans may wish to get their clothing stitched as per authorized specifications. This provision is applicable to Central Armed Police Forces as well. It is, therefore, incorrect and inappropriate to single out Army on this issue through inadequately researched articles in the media.
