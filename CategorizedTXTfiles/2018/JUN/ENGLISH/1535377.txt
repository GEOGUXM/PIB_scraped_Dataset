      Proposed amendments to Income-tax Rules, 1962 - Inviting comments of stakeholders
      Posted On: 13 JUN 2018 7:19PM by PIB Delhi


    Income-tax Rules, 1962 (I.T.Rules) prescribe Form No.36 for filing an appeal to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT). Further, a memorandum of cross-objections to the ITAT can be filed in Form No.36A.


    The existing Form No.36 and Form No 36A have not been revised since long. These Forms are required to be rationalised to make them more informative and also to capture information regarding amount disputed in pending appeals before ITAT, which is vital for formulating the policy of the department for litigation management.


    In view of the above, a draft notification proposing amendments in Form No. 36, Form No.36A and Rule 47 of the IT Rules has been uploaded on the website of the Income Tax Department www.incometaxindia.gov.in for comments from stakeholders and general public.


    The comments and suggestions on the draft notification may be sent by 2 nd July, 2018 electronically at the email address ts.mapwal@nic.in
