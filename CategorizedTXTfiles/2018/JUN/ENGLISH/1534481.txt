    Government of India has constituted a group of eminent persons to study the Special Economic Zones (SEZ) Policy of India.


    The SEZ Policy was implemented from 01 st April, 2000. Subsequently the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005 was passed by Parliament in May, 2005 and received Presidential assent on the 23 rd of June, 2005 and the Special Economic ZoneAct was enacted. The SEZ Act, 2005, supported by SEZ Rules, came into effect on 10 th February, 2006.


    The group will evaluate the SEZ policy, suggest measures to cater to the needs of exporters in the present economic scenario and make the SEZ policy WTO compatible, suggest course correction in SEZ policy, make comparative analysis of the SEZ scheme and dovetail the SEZ policy with other similar schemes.


    The Group is required to submit its recommendation in 3 Monthsâ€™ time.
