      Posted On: 21 JUN 2018 5:58PM by PIB Delhi


    Instances have occurred wherein an Appellant/Complainant dies before his case is considered by the Central Information Commission (CIC). Further action to be taken in such a situation has engaged the attention of the Commission.


    The Commission carefully considered this matter in its meeting held on June 5, 2018 and decided that in case of death of the Appellant/Complainant, the case will be heard as usual as Second Appeal/Complaint and the decision put up on the website of the Commission. Orders have accordingly been issued on June 18, 2018 and also put on the website of the Commission.
