    Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will take part in an interaction with young innovators and start up entrepreneurs tomorrow.


    PM said, "Tomorrow at 9:30 AM, I will take part in an exciting interaction with youngsters from the world of start-ups & innovation. The interaction offers a wonderful opportunity to hear directly from pioneering young innovators who have excelled as start-up entrepreneurs.


    India has emerged a hub for start-ups and innovation. Indian youngsters have distinguished themselves due to their futuristic and out-of-the-box thinking. During tomorrow’s interaction youngsters from leading incubation centres and tinkering labs will be taking part as well.


    I would particularly urge my young friends to join tomorrow’s interaction. It is a wonderful way to learn, grow & get inspired. You can join the interaction via the ‘Narendra Modi Mobile App’ or @DDNewsLive. If you have any idea or suggestion, do share it on social media. "
