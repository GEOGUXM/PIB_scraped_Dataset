    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today inaugurated the Bahadurgarh-Mundka Metro Line via video conference.


    Congratulating the people of Haryana and Delhi on the commencement of this new section of the Delhi Metro, he said he was happy to see Bahadurgarh connected with the Delhi Metro.


    This is the third place in Haryana, after Gurugram and Faridabad to be connected like this.


    The Prime Minister spoke of how the Metro in Delhi has positively impacted the lives of citizens. Noting that Bahadurgarh is witnessing tremendous economic growth, the Prime Minister said that there are several educational centres there, and students from there even travel to Delhi. The Metro will make this more convenient, he added.


    Shri Narendra Modi said that there is a direct link between connectivity and development. He said the Metro will mean more employment opportunities for the people in the area.


    The Prime Minister said that the Union Government has brought out a policy relating to Metros, to bring uniformity and standardization in metro rail networks across the country. He said the objective is to build convenient, comfortable and affordable urban transport systems in our cities. He said that the aim is also to boost “Make in India” by making metro rail coaches in India itself.


    The Prime Minister said that the process of making Metro systems is also linked to cooperative federalism. Wherever Metros are being built in India, the Centre and the respective State Governments are working together, he added.


    Noting that New India requires new and smart infrastructure, the Prime Minister said that the Union Government is working on roads, railways, highways, airways, waterways and i-ways. There is focus on connectivity and on ensuring that development projects are completed on time, he added.
