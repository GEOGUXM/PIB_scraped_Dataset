    Shri Narendra Modi said that occasions such as the seventy-fifth anniversary of freedom in 2022, and the 150 th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, can serve as inspirational milestones for achieving development goals and targets. He said the upcoming KumbhMela could also serve as an important occasion for promoting nationally relevant causes.
