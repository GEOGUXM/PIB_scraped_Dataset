      Posted On: 13 JUN 2018 3:57PM by PIB Delhi


    The objective of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas can be fully achieved once the benefits of the interventions reach the last mile. As a step beyond measurement of outcomes, NITI Aayog has come out with various indices that not only fulfills its mandate of cooperative and competitive federalism but also challenges States and Union Territories (UTs) them to meet the aspirations of the new India.


    Furthering this mandate, NITI Aayog has come up with the Composite Water Management Index as a useful tool to assess and improve the performance in efficient management of water resources. This index is an attempt to inspire States and UTs towards efficient and optimal utilization of water, and recycling thereof with a sense of urgency.


    In view of limitations on availability of water resources and rising demand for water, sustainable management of water resources has acquired critical importance. The index can be utilised to formulate and implement suitable strategies for better management of water resources. It has been finalized after an elaborate exercise including seeking feedback from the States and consultation with reputed experts.


    The index would provide useful information for the States and also for the concerned Central Ministries/Departments enabling them to formulate and implement suitable strategies for better management of water resources.


    Shri Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation (WR,RD&GR) shall be releasing the Index during a press conference, in the presence of Shri Rajiv Kumar, Vice-Chairman, NITI Aayog, Shri Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog, Shri UP Singh, Secretary, WR, RD & GR, Shri Amarjeet Sinha, Secretary, Rural Development and Shri Parameswaran Iyer, Secretary, Drinking Water & Sanitation.
