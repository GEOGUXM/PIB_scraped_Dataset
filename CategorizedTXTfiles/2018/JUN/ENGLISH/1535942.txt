    Minister of Commerce and Industry, Suresh Prabhu, releasing national strategy for standardisation in New Delhi.


    Indiaâ€™s quest for providing best quality begins with identifying standards, stated Suresh Prabhu, Minister of Commerce and Industry. He was speaking at the 5 th National Standards Conclave - Implementing the Indian National Strategy for Standardization, being held in New Delhi on 19-20 June 2018, organized by Department of Commerce and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).


    Speaking at the event, the Minister said that unless products are standardised it becomes difficult to market them. Standardisation boosts both exports as well as domestic economic growth by enabling realisation of value of product and services and consumers will be the biggest beneficiary.


    Two reports were also released by the Minister, Indian National Strategy for Standardization (INSS) and CII-ASL Study on TBT/SPS Notifications. INSS is the result of the combined efforts of Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Ministry of Consumer Affairs and industry stakeholders. It provides a vision for the country to achieve the highest quality standards in production and distribution of goods and services in an attempt to reclaim Brand India. The INSS report addresses four broad pillars of Quality Ecosystem: (i) Standards Development (ii) Conformity Assessment and Accreditation (iii) Technical Regulations and SPS Measures (iv) Awareness and Education.


    Commerce Secretary, Ms. Rita Teaotia and Joint Secretary, Department of Commerce, Sudhanshu Pandey were also present during this occasion.
