In this context, the Prime Minister mentioned the various schemes of the Union Government which seek to empower the poor and under privileged sections of society, such as Jan Dhan Yojana, Ujjwala Yojana, insurance schemes, toilet construction, and direct benefits transfer. He also mentioned the increase in pace in various infrastructure sectors such as roads, railways, optical fibre network etc. He said the Union Government is working to ensure that all parts of India receive the fruits of development.
