      CBDT issues clarification about loss/damage to records in the Scindia House fire at Income Tax Office, Mumbai
      Posted On: 04 JUN 2018 10:31AM by PIB Delhi


    News reports have been appearing in some sections of the media alleging that records & documents relating to investigation into the Nirav Modi/Mehul Choksi case have been destroyed in the Scindia House fire in Income Tax Office in Mumbai. It is hereby clarified that the said reports are completely false & misdirected.


    It is further clarified that the records/documents of the ongoing investigations into the Nirav Modi/ Mehul Choksi case had already been transferred to the assessment units housed in different buildings, as part of the assessment process.


    Apprehensions about any loss/ damage to the records/documents relating to the Nirav Modi/Mehul Choksi case in the said fire at the IT Office, Mumbai are, therefore, misplaced.
