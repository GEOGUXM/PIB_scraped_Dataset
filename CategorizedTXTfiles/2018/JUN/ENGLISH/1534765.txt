    In order to address the larger agenda of Women Empowerment, the focus on Women by each of the sections of the Government needs to be constant as well as evolving. This was stressed by Smt.Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, Honâ€™ble Minister for Women and Child Development in her letter to the various Ministers of the Union Government. The Minister also noted that complete convergence of the inter-ministerial efforts for effective implementation of various initiatives and schemes is needed. A focal point in the key Ministries at the central level so that the women are kept in focus in the overall Governance scheme is also necessary, the Minister specified in the letter.


    To keep Women in focus in all the Government schemes, the Minister requested to create a division headed by Joint Secretary (or designate one of the existing Joint Secretaries as head) to spearhead engendering of Government schemes/programmes from conceptualization to the last mile implementation. The Minister added that this will have a major impact in the long run in the quest for women empowerment.


    The Minister also informed that the Ministry of Home Affairs has decided to create a new division to address the issues of Women safety which would bring focus and synergy in the efforts of the Government in addressing the crimes against women.


    The Minister also listed significant initiatives and achievements of the Ministry of Women and Child Development and thanked the Ministries for their collaboration in making these initiatives successful.
