      Re-Development of all the Seven Government Colonies Done with Complete Adherence to Environmental Sustainability and Green Building Concepts

    The redevelopment of the seven colonies viz. Nauroji Nagar, Netaji Nagar, Sarojini Nagar, Mohammadpur, Sriniwaspuri, Kasturba Nagar and Thyagaraj Nagar will lead to an increase the green area coverage by about 3 times from the existing green space area and the compensatory plantation of trees will be done in the ratio of 1:10 thereby resulting in enhanced tree coverage area. The re-development of the seven colonies is been done with complete adherence to environmental sustainability and green building concepts and special care and attention is being given towards retaining maximum number of existing trees and incorporating them in large cluster as an integral part of landscaping design scheme.


    There have been misleading press reports in the media regarding felling of trees in the context of redevelopment of the above mentioned government colonies which are not only factually incorrect but also ignore the magnitude of compensatory efforts undertaken to not only increase the tree count but also efforts made for substantial increase in the green space area in the redeveloped colonies.


    As regards to felling of trees, the following facts are highlighted:

      * With the design of multi-storied residential/commercial blocks, the effective ground coverage has drastically reduced; enabling more space for the green area. Green area of 10,69,235 Sqm is being proposed in the conceptual plan of all the seven colonies against the existing Green Space of 3,83,101 Sqm. in these colonies. Thus about 3 times more green space shall be available. — Refer Annexure-I

      * All the trees are not being cut. Only 14,031 nos. trees are to be cut out of the existing trees of 21,040 nos. Moreover, against the 21,040 nos. of existing trees; 23,475 nos. of trees shall be available in these colonies during/after the Re-development (saving of 6,834 nos., transplantation of 1,213 nos. and new plantation of 15,428 nos.). — Refer Annexure-II.


      * Besides the above, compensatory plantation of trees is being carried out in a ratio of 1:10, i.e. ten trees are being planted against the loss of one tree. Thus 1,35,460 (one lakh thirty-five thousand four hundred sixty) trees shall be planted which will create an " Urban Forest " thus generating oxygen and reducing the pollution level in the city. - Refer Annexure-II.


    Apart from the special efforts for protection, preservation and replantation of trees as given above, the upcoming complexes are being developed according to “Green Building Concepts”, zero waste discharge and environmental sustainability by the following measures:

      * Ground coverage restricted to 15-20% against the existing ground coverage of 50%. The green area will be 50%.
      * Plantations/transplantation as green barrier along boundary to cover main roads.
      * Orientation of houses as per sun path to avoid heat gain in the building and green terraces to mitigate heat gain.
      * Solar panels used for renewable energy. The total solar power generation in the 7 GPRAs will be 5,654 KW.
      * Solid waste/Waste water will be collected, segregated and treated in-house and reused for horticulture purposes and flushing. Solid waste will also be used as manure for horticulture.
      * Rainwater harvesting system for recharging the ground water.
      * Use of recycled material from construction and demolition waste to be used in construction of structures such as kerb stone, footpath tiles, etc.

    The upcoming complexes are being developed by providing green spaces, with lush green trees around the constructed building. An example of the same is the development of New Moti Bagh Complex and East Kidwai Nagar Project.


    Ministry's endeavour has been to provide exemplary models of development for the future generations. Change is inevitable and so is the need of the hour for the city. With utmost care and respect towards our natural environment, all measures are being taken in the planning and designing of these colonies to construct a Green Project with "Griha Certification". As such green cover and sustainability of environment is adequate and appropriately ensured after the redevelopment of Seven Colonies.
