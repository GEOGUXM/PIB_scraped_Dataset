    Yoga gives physical and mental relief to human being and it takes humankind towards total growth, said Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Culture & MoS for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Dr Mahesh Sharma. He was in the city today to be a part of celebration of 4 th International Day of Yoga, where he spoke in length about the positive aspects of Yoga for keeping physique and mind totally stress-free.


    The Minister said, as a doctor he is practising Yoga for nearly 30 years. He reiterated that the Yoga not only adds to the growth of the physique, it even helps people keeping away from mental illnesses. Yoga also enhances the communication level among people, he added.


    The Minister said, Yoga is the indicator of human index too. Pointing out the physical fitness and mental alertness of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, who sleeps only 4-5 hours a day, Dr. Sharma said, such acumen has been earned by the Prime Minister as he performs Yoga every day. According to him, Yoga is a powerful instrument to bind the entire world into one and the credit for this goes to our Prime Minister, he added.


    Dr Sharma even performed Yoga with innumerable school children and the citizens of the city who gathered on the occasion. The entire event was organised by Ghoshâ€™s Yoga College, SAS Fitness, Shutterbug, Friends of Kolkata and ChooseGreen.in. A sapling was even presented to the Minister by ChooseGreen.in, an NGO working for reviving greenery in the city.
