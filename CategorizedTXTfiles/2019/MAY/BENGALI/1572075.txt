The Festival kicked off on May 14 and will continue up to May 25, 2019 with India missing from the official selection for the first time in this decade. All three of them are ex-students of Satyajit Ray Film & Television Institute (SRFTI).

It invites ten directors working on their first or second features, to the festival along with their producers. Sangma will participate along with Chinese co-producer Jianshang Xu, who was also involved in the making of "Ma'Ama".


    
    Saurav Rai will pitch his debut work-in-progress narrative feature, "Nimtoh" (Invitation), in the Hong Kong Asia Film Financing Forum (HAF). He is going to Cannes' programme in the festival's Marche du Film (Film Market).


    
    Kolkata based cinematographer Modhura Palit will travel to Cannes to be part of the 7th edition of the Angenieux Excel Lens in Cinematography ceremony. She will receive the Angenieux Special Encouragement for excellence in Cinematography, which is given to a young professional.
