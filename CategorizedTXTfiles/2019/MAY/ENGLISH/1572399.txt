    The Counting of Votes for General Election to the House of the People – 2019 shall be held on 23 rd May, 2019. In this regard, the Commission has come up with a new IT based initiative, which will enable the system in providing real-time trends and results of the vote counting across the States/UTs. The counting trends and results will be available on the ECI Website at the URL https://results.eci.gov.in as well as on the Voter Helpline App, both iOS and Android Mobile Apps. The dissemination will start functioning from 8.00 a.m. on the Counting Day and would be continuously updated.


    The Voter Helpline App can be downloaded from the Google Play Store or Apple Play Store. For the first time, the citizens can use a smart phone to know the results. They can use the available filter to find out the winning/leading or trailing candidate details, along with the Constituency-wise or State-wise results from the Voter Helpline App. The citizens can bookmark their favourite candidate and watch the real-time results, as per their convenience on the Voter Helpline App or make a wish list to track the real-time status.


    The local display of the trends and results by the CEOs/ROs/DEOs will also be done through the Digital Display Panels provided by Election Commission of India.
