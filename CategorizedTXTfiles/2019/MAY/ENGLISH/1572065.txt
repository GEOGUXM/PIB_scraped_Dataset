Pandey, and officers of DGHRM-CBIC. The Directorate General of Human Resource Management (DGHRM), the HR arm of CBIC is the implementing Agency of this ambitious project. It is being implemented in over 400 formations of CBIC across the country.

It brings a complete change in APAR management of such large number of Group ‘B’ & ‘C’ Officers/ Staff of CBIC, which would, in turn, lead to better HR Management.
