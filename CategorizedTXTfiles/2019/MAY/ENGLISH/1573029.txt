      Posted On: 31 MAY 2019 8:50PM by PIB Delhi


    Prime Minister Narendra Modi met H.E Mr Md. Abdul Hamid, President of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh at noon today at Hyderabad House.


    During the meeting, the leaders expressed great satisfaction at the excellent state of bilateral relations. The visiting President conveyed felicitations of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was unable to travel in person because of a prior commitment. He conveyed the invitation of the Government of Bangladesh to Prime Minister to visit that country, which was accepted with pleasure. The leaders agreed that dates would be decided through diplomatic channels.


    Prime Minister Modi noted that the bilateral relationship, forged in Bangladesh’s War of Liberation, remained of the highest priority to India. In the past five years, the two countries had demonstrated great maturity and patience in resolving a number of complex pending issues, such as the demarcation of the Land Boundary. The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of India and Bangladesh raising ties to a new level, as part of a joint effort to suitably commemorate the centenary of the birth of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (in 2020) and the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh’s Liberation, in 2021.


    The President of Bangladesh was in India to attend the Swearing-in Ceremony of the new Government of India on May 30, 2019. The distinguished guest has earlier paid a State Visit to India in December 2014, as well as an official visit in March 2018, for the first meeting of the International Solar Alliance.
