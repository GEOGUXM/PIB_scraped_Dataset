      Posted On: 14 MAY 2019 4:23PM by PIB Delhi


    Officer trainees of the Indian Foreign Service (2018 batch), as well as two officer trainees from the Royal Bhutan Foreign Service, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, today (May 14, 2019) at Rashtrapati Bhavan.


    Addressing the officer trainees, the President said that India’s role and influence in the international arena is expanding. Geopolitics and geoeconomics are drawing Asia to the centre of global power relations. And in this matrix, India has an important role to play - as a driver of global growth and as an influential voice in global governance.


    The President said the international community has greater appreciation of India and its global standing. Nations are looking to us for solutions to global challenges – be it climate change, cybersecurity, humanitarian disasters or combating extremism and terrorism. These open unprecedented opportunities but also pose new challenges for our diplomacy.
