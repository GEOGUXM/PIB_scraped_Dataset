    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:

         1. Crude oil production by ONGC during April, 2019 was 1690.97 TMT which is 0.44% higher than the target but 4.86% lower when compared with April, 2018.
         2. Crude oil production by OIL during April, 2019 was 265.21 TMT which is 4.04% lower than the target and 3.33% lower when compared with April, 2018.Shortfall in production was mainly due to less than planned contribution from work over well and drilling wells.
         1. Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs in PSC regime during April, 2019 was 756.43TMT which is 0.47% lower than the target and 12.38% lower when compared with April, 2018.Major reasonsin for lower production are:

      * Loss from Mangala due to delay in upgrade of Mangala Processing Terminal (MPT) and delay in drilling, completion and hooking up online 45 infill wells (CEIL).

      * Lower yield from NE development drilling campaign due to geological uncertainties (CEIL).
      * Closure of around 100 oil wells due to various reasons like liquid handling constraint at MPT plant, pump failure, surface facility limitation, etc (CEIL).

    2.Natural Gas


    Natural gas production during April, 2019 was 2655.89 MMSCM which is 0.49% lower than the target and 0.26% lower when compared with April, 2018.Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II .

    Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production


         1. CPSE Refineries’ production during April, 2019 was 11263.33TMT which is 3.20%lowerwhen compared with April, 2018.Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


      * IOCL, Guwahati: Restricted due to lower Assam Crude Availability.

      * IOCL, Gujarat: Lower due to extension in M&I shutdown due to delay.
      * IOCL, Digboi: Lower due to lowerAssam Crude Availability.
      * IOCL, Panipat: Lower due to idling of Naptha splitter for want of PESO clearance.
      * IOCL, Bongaigaon: Restricted due to lower crude availability.
      * HPCL, Mumbai: Lower mainly due to deferred shutdown of primary processing unit.
      * MRPL: Lower due to non-availability of crude because ofdelay in SPM maintenance activities.

    3.2 Production in JV refineries during April, 2019 was 1721.66TMT which is 14.73% higherwhen compared with April, 2018.


    3.3 Production in private refineries during April, 2019 was 7718.08TMT which is 14.90% higherwhen compared with April, 2018.
