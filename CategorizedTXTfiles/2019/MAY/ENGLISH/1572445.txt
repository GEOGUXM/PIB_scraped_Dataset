    Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi spoke with H.E. Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, today.


    The Prime Minister of Bangladesh had initiated the call to extend her congratulations on the clear mandate given by the people of India to the NDA Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. In doing so, PM Sheikh Hasina became one of the first foreign leaders to congratulate the Prime Minister, thus reflecting the extraordinarily close and cordial ties between India and Bangladesh, and the excellent rapport that the two leaders enjoy.


    The two leaders pledged to continue to raise the India-Bangladesh relationship to unprecedented new heights. They recognised the importance of rapidly completing on-going plans for deepening the partnership in security trade, transportation, energy and people to people ties. Doing so within the next 3 years would have specific significance in view of the centenary of the birth of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 2020 and the 50thanniversary of Bangladesh's Liberation in 2021.


    The leaders also agreed to identify dates for a meeting at the earliest, to resume work in service of the bilateral relationship.
