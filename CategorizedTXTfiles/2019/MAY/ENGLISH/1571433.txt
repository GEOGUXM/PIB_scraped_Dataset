    The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has said that public satisfaction must be the yardstick to measure the performance of public servants.


    He wanted them to improve knowledge and acquire technical skills and constantly learn from the global best governance practices to make the Indian administrative system better, efficient and effective.


    Shri Naidu, while addressing Assistant Secretaries, Section Officers, and employees of Andhra Pradesh Secretariat in New Delhi, asked them to rise to the occasion and strive to fulfill the aspirations of people, especially the youth.


    Emphasizing that responsive and efficient governance mechanism was the need of the hour, Shri Naidu wanted officials to ensure time-bound delivery of public services in a transparent manner.


    The Vice President advised them to review, reform and refine working methods and procedures to ensure that the benefits of government programs reach the last man in the line. “Everyone must perform his or her duty with sincerity, honesty, integrity, and discipline”, he added.


    Suggesting that all administrative matters must be carried out in the State’s official language, Shri Naidu urged them to be sympathetic to the needs of people who come to them with their grievances.


    More than 30 officers from the finance department of Andhra Pradesh have called on Vice President. They are undergoing a month-long training program at National Institute of Financial Management (NIFM), Faridabad in areas such as expenditure management, budget management, and fiscal responsibility and taxation.
