    In order to provide succor to those in immediate need of assistance at most affected villages around Puri in the aftermath of extreme severe cyclone FANI, Indian Navy continues the Relief Operation with 3 ships using their integral helicopters. The helicopters have been utilized for airdropping food packets in areas which are inundated and inaccessible by road. In addition, Relief Camp and Community Kitchen at Pentakota village in Puri catering for 1000 personnel has been set up since 05 May 19. 5000 ltr potable water supplied to Chattragad village using water bowser from INS Chilka. Supply of another 5000 ltrs bottled water is being augmented from Visakhapatnam by road which is expected to reach the Relief camp site by midnight today.


    Based on a request from the Temple Administration, a Naval Diving Team from INS Chilka undertook diving operations to clear off sand, plastic, other organic matter accumulated alongside the Kalijai floating Jetty, and carried out underwater assessment of the Jetty for safe operations on 05 May 19. The two-hour long activity was undertaken by a team of 06 Divers with the specialised equipment. The floating Jetty used for ferry of tourist boats was affected by the impact of cyclone. High speed winds gusting over 100 kmph deposited large quantity of sand, plastic, other organic matter alongside Jetty which prohibited the ferrying of large boats with higher draughts alongside the Jetty, thus disrupting connectivity of the island with the Main land.


    In order to render medical assistance, Naval Medical Teams have set up Medical Camps at four locations at Chattraged and Jankia villages in Odisha. About 150 personnel have been provided medical assistance and medicines were distributed to those in need. The medical team also sensitized the villages on preventive measures to avoid water-borne deceases and discussed other health related issues. The teams also assisted in distribution of food to the stranded villagers affected by the cyclone.
