    In a landmark achievement for Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) Pune, theAll India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has granted approval to five courses of FTII under AICTE's newly created APPLIED ARTS AND CRAFTS category. This approval makes India's premier film school,FTII,the first and only Institute in this category in the country to receive such recognition.


    A list of Institutions and approved Courses published by AICTE on Saturday,11th May under its newly-constituted category pertaining to Institutes offering courses in applied arts,crafts and design, includes FTII and all its five one-year Post Graduate Certificate courses.


    Of the five FTII courses which have received AICTE approval, four are in Television wing (Direction, Electronic Cinematography, Video Editing and Sound Recording & TV Engineering) and one in Film wing (Feature Film Screenplay Writing).


    "This is a historic moment for FTII to have received AICTE approval for all five PG Certificate courses.This makes FTII the first film school in India to receive this recognition.


    In recent years FTII's television courses have been in the limelight winning several National awards and even international honours. The AICTE approval lends more value to the TV courses making them as attractive as the film wing specializations. Screen writers from FTII are already making their mark in the entertainment industry. With the AICTE approval coming into effect from 2019-20, students entering TV courses and Feature Film Screenplay Writing course this year stand to gain.This is as important a watershed event as the Master's degree equivalence granted to FTII's six PG Diploma film wing courses by Association of Indian Universities (AIU) in January 2017. With this, all 11 FTII courses now stand approved by either AIU or AICTE.", said Sh Brijendra Pal Singh,Chairman, FTII Governing Council.
