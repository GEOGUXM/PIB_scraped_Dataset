    As per the Economic Survey 2017-18, the electronic commerce (e-commerce) market in India is estimated at USD 33 billion, with a 19.1 percent growth rate in 2016-17. As per the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) Strategic Review 2018, in the Information Technology and Business Process Management (IT-BPM) sector in India, the Indian e-commerce market was USD 33 billion in 2017-18 and reached USD 38.5 billion, growing at a rate of about 17% in the financial year 2018-19.


    It has come to the notice of the Government through the complaints lodged by the consumers in the National Consumer Helpline being run by the Department of Consumer Affairs that the consumers have grievances relating to payment, quality and quantity issues, manufacturing defects, non-providing of services, etc relating to e-commerce. The complaints of the consumers are transferred through the system software to the companies concerned for redressal. In cases where consumers are not satisfied with the redressal, they are advised to approach a Consumer Forum of appropriate jurisdiction for redressal of their grievances. The consumer fora are empowered to give relief of a specific nature and award, wherever appropriate, compensation to consumers.


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri C.R. Chaudhary in Lok Sabha today.
