    Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE), with effect from 2018-19. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are provision of quality education and enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring minimum standards in schooling provision, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions. The scheme also provides for support for upgradation of secondary schools to senior secondary level and addition of new streams in existing senior secondary schools.


    During the year 2018-19, under Samagra Shiksha, 44 schools have been upgraded from secondary to senior secondary level and additional subject streams have been approved in 851 senior secondary schools, based on appraisal of the proposals received from the States/UTs.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Dr. Satya Pal Singh today in a written reply to a Lok Sabha question.
