    A team of Officials from Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), Mumbai conducted an Enforcement Search and Seizure operation at Ulhasnagar on 19/2/2019 to check the misuse of ISI Mark on PVC Insulated Cables. During the raid at the premises of M/s Jhalak Cables, Plot 5, Khemani Industrial Area, OT Section, Ulhasnagar, Maharashtra they were found misusing the BIS Certification Mark (ISI Mark) without a valid licence from BIS on PVC Insulated Cables with various brand names “MAXX”, “DEE PEE”, “AEROLEX”, and “GOLDEN KING” manufactured by them. About 155 coils and marking wheels were seized during the raid.
