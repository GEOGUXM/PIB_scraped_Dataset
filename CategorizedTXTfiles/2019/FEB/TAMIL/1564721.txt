      Posted On: 15 FEB 2019 2:59PM by PIB Chennai


    BSNL IS PREPARING TO LAUNCH 4G SERVICE IN A BIG WAY IN TAMILNADU. 4G SERVICES ARE BEING LAUNCHED IN TWO CITIES NAMELY COIMBATORE AND SALEM VERY SHORTLY, FOLLOWED BY FOUR OTHER CITIES NAMELY TIRUCHIRAPPALLI, MADURAI, VELLORE AND NAGERCOIL. SUBSEQUENTLY, 4G SERVICES WILL BE INTRODUCED IN OTHER CITIES ALSO.


    BSNL MOBILE CUSTOMERS ARE BEING PROVIDED WITH 4G SIM FREE OF COST IN PLACE OF THEIR 3G SIM, AT COIMBATORE AND SALEM CITIES, WHERE 4G SERVICE IS BEING ROLLED OUT. 4G SERVICES WILL BE STARTED IN THESE TWO CITIES WHEN A MAJORITY OF THE CUSTOMERS HAVE RECEIVED FREE SIM REPLACEMENT. 4G CUSTOMERS WILL GET FAST DATA DOWNLOAD UPTO 21 MBPS.


    MORE THAN 2 LAKH NEW MOBILE CUSTOMERS ARE BEING ADDED TO BSNL NETWORK IN TAMILNADU EVERY MONTH. CUSTOMERS SWITCHING OVER TO BSNL FROM OTHER OPERATORS THROUGH MNP ARE ALSO INCREASING IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS.


    A MISLEADING REPORT HAS APPEARED IN A SECTION OF THE MEDIA CONVEYING THE IMPRESSION THAT BSNL MAY BE CLOSED DOWN. THIS IS NOT TRUE. THERE IS NO PROPOSAL UNDER CONSIDERATION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA FOR CLOSURE OF BSNL. ON THE CONTRARY, GOVERNMENT OF INDIA WANTS TO HAVE A ROBUST BSNL, SERVING THE PEOPLE OF INDIA WITH ITS HUGE INFRASTRUCTURE AND NETWORK THROUGHOUT INDIA.


    IN ORDER TO HELP BSNL TO TIDE OVER THE PRESENT FINANCIAL CRISIS DUE TO THE LOSS OF REVENUE OWING TO THE TARIFF REDUCTION TO MEET THE STIFF COMPETITION, DEPARTMENT OF TELECOMMMUNICATIONS IS WORKING OUT A COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL SUPPORT PACKAGE TO BSNL.


    IT IS THEREFORE CLARIFIED TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC THAT BSNL WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE THE CUSTOMERS WITH THE BEST QUALITY TELECOM SERVICES FOR YEARS TO COME.
