National Nutrition Mission was launched last year reflecting its commitment to provide proper nutrition to every mother and children. “If we succeed in delivering the nutrition coverage to every mother, every child, many lives will be saved.” added PM.

    PM summed up his address, saying these efforts of the foundation showcase the importance of transition of ‘I’ to ‘We’, when we rise above ourselves and think about society.


    Akshaya Patra Foundation works closely with the Ministry of Human Resource Development and State Governments to serve quality, hygienic, and nutritious food to millions of children under the Mid -day meal program.The Foundation has served mid-day meals to 1.76 million children in twelve states covering 14,702 schools. In 2016, Akshaya Patra commemorated the serving of 2 billion cumulative meals in the presence of the then President of India, Pranab Mukherjee. The serving of 3 billionth food for the underprivileged children from schools by Prime Minister narendra Modi is yet another step to reach out to the poor and marginalized sections of the society.
