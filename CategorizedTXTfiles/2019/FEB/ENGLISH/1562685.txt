      Posted On: 05 FEB 2019 4:25PM by PIB Delhi


    As per the fourth advance estimates 2017-18, the area under oilseeds in the country decreased to 246.45 lakh hectares as compared to 261.77 lakh hectares in 2016-17.


    To increase productivity and production of oilseeds, Government of India is implementing National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP) a Centrally Sponsored Scheme since 2014-15. NMOOP scheme is implemented on sharing of expenditure between Central and State Government in the ratio of 60:40 for general category of states, and 90:10 for North Eastern and Himalayan states. The NMOOP scheme has been subsumed under National Food Security Mission (NFSM) with effect from 2018-19, and interventions of NMOOP are taken as sub-components of NFSM.


    Under the programme, various incentives like production and distribution of seeds, supply of minikits, seeds hub, Front Line/Cluster Demonstrations through Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), improved farm implements, bio-pesticides, micronutrients, bio-fertilizers etc. are provided to the farmers. Modern technologies like improved varieties, ridge-furrow methods of planting, effective water management, application of bio-fertilizers, inter cropping with cereals/pulses, eco-friendly plant protection measures etc. are promoted through cluster demonstrations.


    In addition, Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) of oilseeds have been increased over the years to encourage farmers to grow more oilseeds.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in Lok Sabha today.
