    The Government has conveyed its approval to the NVS for engagement of two counsellors per school (1 male and 1 female) in all the functional JNVs, on outsourcing basis.


    The Central Govt has launched an integrated centrally sponsored scheme for school education- Samagra Siksha w.e.f. 2018-19 with the key objectives of quality education and improvement in learning levels. Under this scheme, the State Govt. and UTs are supported on several interventions to improve teaching standards, regular in-service teachers’ training, induction training for newly recruited teachers, ICT facilities in schools, introduction of vocational educational component at secondary level etc.


    The other initiatives inter-alia include the following:


      * Section 23(2) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 was amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31.03.2019.


      * In order to focus on quality education, the RTE rules have been amended to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise learning outcomes. Learning outcomes for each class upto the elementary stage have been finalised and shared with all States and UTs.


      * National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievements of children in Classes III, V, VIII and X.


      * To complement the activities under Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat and to inculcate reading habits among students, an annual grant of Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 20,000 per school has been provisioned under Samagra Siksha for strengthening of school libraries.


      * The Rashtriya Avaishkar Abhiyan (RAA) has been launched to motivate and engage children of the age-group of 6-18 years in science, maths and technology through observation, experimentation, both through inside and outside classroom activities.


      * The Atal Tinkering labs have been established in many schools across the country with the objective of fostering curiosity, creativity and imagination in young minds.
