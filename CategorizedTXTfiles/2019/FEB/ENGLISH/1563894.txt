    In cases of illegal transfer based on the nature and circumstances of the case, FIRs / criminal cases have been filed against the sellers / purchasers, Courts have been approached to set aside such transactions. Competent Revenue authorities have also been approached for not effecting mutation of such transactions. Such transactions are not recognised and no mutation in defence land records are effected.To prevent such incidences in future, the following steps are taken:-

      * The defence land across the country has been surveyed by Defence Estates Officers and Chief Executive Officers so as to clearly demarcate defence land to enable Services / Users to physically protect it.
      * Matter has been taken up with the State Governments vigorously at all levels to mutate remaining defence land in the revenue records.
      * Suggestions have been made by the Ministry to the Department of Land Resources for amending the Registration Act so as to make it mandatory for the Sub-Registrar to obtain ‘NOC’ from defence authorities prior to effecting registration of land located in Cantonments / Military Stations.
      * Wherever such incidence is reported, immediate legal action is taken to protect the interest of Government.
      * Computerisation of defence Land records contained in General Land Registers (GLRs) and Military Land Registers (MLRs) with the use of RakshaBhoomi Software.
      * Strengthening of defence land management by way of digitisation of land records, survey, demarcation and verification of defence lands and land Audit.

    The computerization of defence land records under the project ‘RakshaBhoomi’ was undertaken by the Directorate General of Defence Estates in association with National Informatics Centre. Defence Land Records contained in General Land Registers (GLRs) and Military Land Registers (MLRs) were entered in the RakshaBhoomi Software and made operational after verification and authentication of database in July, 2011.
