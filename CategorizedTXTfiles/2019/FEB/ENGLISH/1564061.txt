    1).The State Governments of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura have sent proposals for construction of storage godowns under Central Sector Scheme (Grant-in-aid). The details of funds released under Central Sector Scheme for construction of intermediate godowns from 01.04.2017 to 01.02.2019 are at Annexure-I.
