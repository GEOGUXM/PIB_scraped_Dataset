    The Advisory Committees of NGMA Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi have not been dissolved . Their terms have ended recently (Mumbai and Bengaluru committee terms ended on 15 November 2018 and of Delhi on 17 January 2019). The committees are in the process of being reconstituted.


    The recommendations of previous Advisory Committees (which are upto December 2019 for NGMA, Mumbai) will be honored and exhibitions of artists will be held as proposed. The new advisory committee will take a decision relating to future exhibitions.
