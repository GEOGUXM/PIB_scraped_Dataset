      Posted On: 04 FEB 2019 5:59PM by PIB Delhi


    In pursuance to the Judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India dated 8.5.2009 in Civil Appeal No. 887/2009, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has framed “UGC Regulations on curbing the menace of ragging in higher educational institutions, 2009” notified on 17 th June, 2009. In order to ensure the strict compliance of these regulations UGC sends circular to all universities twice a year and also creates awareness through media campaigning like TVCs, Posters, Jingles and Films.


    Owing to the awareness campaigns and realization in the students the reporting of the cases of ragging has improved during 2018. Encouraged by the commitment of the government to tackle the menace of ragging, the students garner courage to call the anti-ragging helpline for registering their ragging complaintw.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Dr. Satya Pal Singh today in a written reply to a Lok Sabha question.
