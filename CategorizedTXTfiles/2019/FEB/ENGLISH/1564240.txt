      Posted On: 13 FEB 2019 4:45PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government has decided to develop defence industrial corridor in the state of Uttar Pradesh. It has earmarked six nodal points for setting up of Defence industrial corridor in Uttar Pradesh. These are Kanpur, Lucknow, Aligarh, Agra, Jhansi and Chitrakoot. Five stakeholders meetings were also organized. Setting up of this corridor would catalyse indigenous production of defence and aerospace related items, thereby reducing our reliance on imports and promotion of export of these items to other countries. This will lead to generation of employment opportunities and growth of private domestic manufacturers, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and start-ups.
