      Posted On: 11 FEB 2019 12:17PM by PIB Delhi


    The scheme for Cultural Heritage Youth Leadership Programme (CHYLP) envisaged enriching awareness of Indian culture and heritage amongst the youth in order to promote, understand and develop fondness for Indiaâ€™s rich cultural heritage, with a view to develop appropriate leadership qualities amongst youth. The focus of the programme was to be on less privileged children residing in backward areas by interacting with them in vernacular languages for their better understanding. Intermittently programme was given to Centre for Cultural Resources and Training (CCRT), an autonomous organization working under the purview of Ministry of Culture. CCRT organized workshops for the scheme. However, to accelerate the process, Museum Division of this Ministry arranged visits of children of unprivileged section of society to museums so that these children may get an opportunity to gain the knowledge relating to the Indian History and Culture and Science. Details of children of unprivileged section of society visit to museum during 2018-19 is given below


    CCRT allocated Rs.10.00 lakhs for implementation of this scheme.
