    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, graced the 18 th anniversary celebrations of the Swarna Bharat Trust at Venkatachalam, Nellore, Andhra Pradesh today (February 22, 2019).


    Speaking on the occasion, the President noted that when the Swarna Bharat Trust was conceived, it drew inspiration from Mahatma Gandhi’s slogan of “Back to the Villages”. Gandhiji had spoken of the need to develop villages with amenities appropriate for a dignified and simple but prosperous life. He focused on farming, sanitation, education and sustainable living. Gandhiji’s ideas and his basic philosophy are still very relevant. However, with changing times, it is important to renew the methods to achieve those ideals. In this regard technology can be a great enabler.


    The President was happy to note that the Swarna Bharat Trust is engaged in socially relevant and people-centric activities that cover many areas, ranging from education to healthcare and agriculture to skills training. He was also happy to learn that the Swarna Bharat Trust emphasises the use of science and technology and of innovation in helping rural communities.
