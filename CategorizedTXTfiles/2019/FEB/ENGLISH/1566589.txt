Most of the major crops producing states have witnessed normal monsoon rainfall. Accordingly, the production of most of the crops for the agricultural year 2018-19 has been estimated higher than their normal production. These estimates are subject to revision on account of more precise information flowing over time.


    2. As per 2 nd Advance Estimates, the estimated production of major crops during 2018-19 is as under:
