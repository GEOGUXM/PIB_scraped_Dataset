We expanded the airport by spending around Rs 125 crore for this small airport”. Tezu airport is ready to give services to the people of Arunachal, he added. Udan scheme will benefit people through cheaper flights. Not just airports, the lives of people in Arunachal Pradesh will improve vastly with new and improved rail and road facilities," says PM.
