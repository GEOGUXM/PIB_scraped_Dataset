    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, received Mr Mauricio Macri, the President of the Republic of Argentina , at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (February 18, 2019). He also hosted a banquet in his honour.


    Welcoming President Macri to India, the President said that his visit is taking place at a time when India and Argentina are celebrating the 70th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations. This makes the visit truly special.


    The President said that our economic partnership holds immense promise. The current bilateral trade of around US$ 3 billion does not reflect true potential. He said that India seeks Argentina’s understanding to create market space for Indian pharma products. Several Indian companies are invested in Argentina, particularly in IT and automobiles. Agriculture is another area where we can do a lot more together.


    Subsequently, in his banquet speech, President Kovind said in trade and technology, agriculture and Antarctic science, cyberspace and satellites, India’s transformative growth and Argentine capabilities are creating new bilateral opportunities. We are both working to create more space for our people in global governance. In this context, India looks forward to contributing to the “Review of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action” next month.
