    To help promote `Make in India’ by manufacturing latest and high-tech products for domestic as well as for exports and to encourage domestic research & development activities, innovation - DoT has issued instructions liberalising import norms for prototype, sample products and test & measurement equipment in license exempt bands without the need of ‘Equipment Type Approval (ETA)’. The devices with radio-interfaces include laptops, notebooks, smart accessories, short range devices, Cameras, Scanners, Printers and mobile handsets.


    2. In addition, the DoT also has enabled ETA through self-certification in its step forward for commercial / finished product imports under the above categories, simplifying regulatory regime while ensuring compliance as well as reducing transaction costs. These measures will enhance ease of doing business in the regulation of consumer wireless products and reduce timelines for clearances.


    The National Digital Communication Policy 2018 has initiated several policy actions to catalyse investments in digital communication sector.


    3. Equipment Type Approval from DoT has been one of the prerequisites for importing products operating in license exempt bands. It is important to mention that the National Frequency Allocation Plan 2018 has taken a radical step in enhancing the license exempt spectrum in 5 GHz band to 605 MHz to trigger enhanced deployment of Wi-Fi services, consumer products and short rage devices for various applications in license exempt bands.
