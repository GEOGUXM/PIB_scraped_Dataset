      Posted On: 11 FEB 2019 3:17PM by PIB Delhi


    International sporting events, including track events, are organized by the world body concerned, in association with the International Olympic Committee (IOC)/National Olympic Committee (NOC) concerned and the National level Sports Federations concerned. Participation of Indian sportspersons in events on the global stage is primarily the responsibility of the National level sports federations/NOCs concerned. Therefore, complete information on remarkable achievements of our country in various sports disciplines including track events on the global stage is not maintained in the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. However, details of Indian sportspersons who have won medals in Olympics, Commonwealth Games and Asian Games during the last three years and the current year, including in track events, is given in Annexure – I . In addition, Ms. Hima Das, an Indian sprint runner was the first Indian athlete to win a gold medal in a track event in 400m at the IAAF World U20 Championships, 2018.


    Sports is a State subject and development of sports, including giving adequate support and encouragement to participate in sports activities held at global stage and allocation of adequate funds to promote sports and games in the country, is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments and National Sports Federations concerned. Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports complements/supplements their efforts in this regard, through various sports promotional schemes being implemented by it. List of sports promotional Schemes being implemented by the Ministry and the budget allocation for the Financial Year 2018-19 is given in Annexure – II. All the play fields/ infrastructure belonging to Sports Authority of India are of international standard and are available to sportspersons.


    This information was given by Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs and Sports Col. Rajyavardhan Rathore (Retd.) in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha today.
