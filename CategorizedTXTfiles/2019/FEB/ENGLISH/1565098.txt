      Posted On: 16 FEB 2019 9:00PM by PIB Delhi


    The Governor of Maharashtra, Mr. Vidya Sagar ji, Chief Minister Shri Devendra ji, my Cabinet colleague Nitin ji, Dr. Subhash Bhamre ji, Ministers of the State Government Mr. Girish Mahajan ji and Jai Kumar Rawal Ji, other dignitaries present on the stage and my dear brothers and sisters, who have come here in such large numbers to bless me. I am told that you all have been waiting for two-three hours in this scorching heat. I salute your patience.


    Friends,


    I am present amongst you at a time when the nation is furious after the terrorist attack on our soldiers at Pulwama. On one hand there is anguish, while on the other hand there are tears. The soil of Maharashtra has also lost its sons. From the land of Khandesh, I salute all the brave sons of the country and their mothers.


    Friends,


    Our Martyrs, our soldiers have always served the nation selflessly. They don't utter a word and are committed. As a nation, we must always stand with the families of those who have sacrificed everything. This is definitely the responsibility of the government and administration; but as the citizens we have a great responsibility too.


    Friends,


    It is time for maintaining restraint and mourning and it is a time to empathize; but I assure every family which has lost its loved one and is in tears that the perpetrators will have to pay a heavy price. The world will now realize that India is a nation of new customs as well as new policy.


    Be it those who fire the gun or those who provide it; be it the ones who hurl the bomb or those who provide it, our brave security force will not let anyone sleep peacefully. As per India's policy, India doesn't instigate violence but let me also make it clear that if anyone provokes New India, then it does not shy away from retaliation. Our Defence forces have proved it before and even this time they will not leave any stone unturned.


    Brothers and sisters,


    The government is ceaselessly working for the country's security and for making the life of the common man easier. Today several projects worth thousands of crores of rupees related to the development of Dhule have either been inaugurated or their foundation stones have been laid. My best wishes to you all for the various projects such as water and sewer related projects at Dhule, irrigation related projects for farmers or connectivity related projects.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Dhule has immense possibilities of becoming the country's industrial town. Its location will facilitate trade with different cities of the country. Several National Highways pass through it. Strengthening its connectivity, we have laid the foundation-stone of two new rail lines. The broadening and electrification work of one of the rail lines has already been completed. Besides, three new trains too have been flagged off today.


    Every family present here today must be having some or the other contact with Surat. Try to recall the Surat as it was 25 years back. Where has Surat reached today after 25-30 years! I wish to tell the people of Dhule that I am seeing Dhule after 30 years! Just have it in writing that this Dhule will be competing with Surat after 30 years from now. Take note of my words. It has such an immense potential that the seeds that we have sown today will grow into a big Banyan tree of development within the next 30 years and Dhule will be at par with Surat and I will be proud of it.


    Do the people of Dhule believe it or not that Dhule is capable of striding ahead and be at par with Surat? We can move ahead with a plan for the next 30 years. If you are ready to move ahead then I too am ready to stand along with you in this journey.


    Friends,


    Today, the work for the first phase of the railway line between Dhule and Nardana has been started. The same line will help in connecting Manmad with Indore in the future. It is estimated that about Rs.9000 crores will be spent on this entire project. On the completion of the Manmad-Indore rail line, the benefits will flow to the entire nation besides Indore and Mumbai.


    Friends,


    Besides, the foundation stone of a new rail line connecting Manmad with Jalgaon has been laid today. On completion, this will not only benefit the people but will also help to provide new employment opportunities to the youth.


    Friends,


    About a decade back, the file for broadening of Udhna-Jalgaon rail line was initiated, which could be completed only now. Doubling and electrification of this line has already been done. Today this line has been dedicated to the nation.


    Friends,


    The foremost benefit of this route is that you have two new trains on Udhna-Nandurbar and Udhna-Paldhi lines. The two trains have been flagged off just a short while ago. Currently, our friends from Udhna too have joined us through technology.


    I congratulate them from Dhule. There is also a similar gathering over there. Our Union Minister of State for Railways Rajen Gohain ji is also present there. Friends, besides this, Dhule's connectivity with Mumbai and Surat will be strengthened by the Khandesh Express running between Bhusawal and Bandra.


    Brothers and sisters,


    There is a significant issue pertaining to this region - water. Dhule, through which Tapi river flows, has been facing water scarcity for a long time. Today a great attempt has been made to address the two challenges of drinking water and irrigation. The central government has started a project under the AMRUT scheme especially to deal with the water scarcity issue in Dhule. Besides, the sewage system that will be built here will also help in keeping the city clean.


    Brothers and sisters,


    The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana was launched to improve the irrigation scenario in Maharashtra including Dhule as well as in several parts of the country. Under this scheme, 99 long pending irrigation projects have been completed, of which 26 projects are from Maharashtra only.


    Brothers and sisters,


    The lower Panzara irrigation project that has been inaugurated today is one of these 26 projects. The work on this project had started 35 years back and at that time it was supposed to be completed at a cost of Rs. 21 crores. Today this project has been completed but at a cost of more than Rs.550 crores.


    Friends,


    The central government is making every possible effort to solve the water scarcity problem of Maharashtra and the resultant drought. A special approval has been given to 91 irrigation projects for Marathwada, Beed and other drought prone areas of Maharashtra. The government is striving to complete these projects worth approximately Rs.14 thousand crores within the stipulated time. On the completion of this project, more than 3.75 lakh hectares of land will be covered under irrigation.


    Brothers and sisters,


    In order to make these irrigation and railway projects a reality, your MP and my cabinet colleague Dr. Subhash Bhamre ji have made a significant contribution. Whenever he used to meet me, I could see his concerns over the drought prone areas in his discussions. He has been constantly pursuing the Sulwade Jamphal Kanoli lift irrigation project.


    Only discussions were going on for the past two decades regarding this project. The foundation stone of the project worth more than Rs.2400 crores has been laid today. Under this project, water from Tapi River will be supplied for irrigating several villages of this area and it will benefit thousands of farmers.


    Friends,


    The central government has worked with an honest intention for the welfare of the farmers, whether it is providing irrigation facilities or saving them from loss due to drought or floods.


    Brothers and sisters,


    The central government has announced major schemes in this year's budget to empower farmers and animal-rearers. With the help of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme, the central government will deposit Rs.6000 every year into the bank accounts of the farmers having less than 5 Acres of land. This will help my farmers to purchase fertilizers, seeds and pesticides in time. They won't have to depend upon the money lenders who give loan on interest.


    Friends,


    Under this scheme, Rs.7.5 lakh crores will be deposited into the bank accounts of the farmers in the next 10 years. It has also been decided that now even the animal rearers will receive loans through Kisan Credit Cards as agricultural loan. This will benefit our milk producers and dairy industry and will increase the income levels of the villages.


    Friends,


    There is a rich history related to cows in Dhule. This land where today's programme has been organized is the land of mother cow. The great freedom fighter Rameshwar Prasad ji had devoted his 14 acres of land to the service of cows. The same tradition of Dhule will get another boost. The central government has decided to form Kamdhenu Aayog in this year's budget for conservation, protection and development of cows and their progeny. This Commission will play a crucial role in empowering our villages through cattle wealth.


    Friends,


    The central government and the government of Maharashtra are working to their full potential for the welfare of the villages, the poor and the tribal community. We are committed to implement our resolution of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'. The poor, oppressed, deprived and tribal families of Maharashtra are getting benefitted from the world's largest healthcare scheme - Ayushman Bharat Yojana. Under this scheme, more than 12 lakh poor patients have already been treated so far of which more than 70,000 belong to Maharashtra and 1800 are from Dhule.


    This scheme that ensures free treatment of up to Rs.5 lakh annually, has given a hope to lakhs of poor, deprived and tribal families. Before coming here, I had got the opportunity to meet a few beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat Yojana. Earlier they used to avoid treatment to save money. They used to endure the diseases and waited for death. They were unable to get treatment due to lack of money. But as soon as they got to know about the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, they took advantage of it. And today, the scheme has saved their lives. Today when I was talking to them, they had a new dream and hope in their eyes. They had new dreams. It was really satisfying to hear them. Their blessings were giving me strength to do more for the citizens of the country. There should not be any shortcomings.


    Brothers and sisters,


    I end my speech by once again congratulating you all for the various development projects.


    With both your fists up in the air, say aloud with me -


    Bharat Mata ki Jai!


    Be loud enough so that the entire Khandesh can hear you.


    Bharat Mata ki Jai!


    Bharat Mata ki Jai!


    Bharat Mata ki Jai!


    Thanks a lot!
