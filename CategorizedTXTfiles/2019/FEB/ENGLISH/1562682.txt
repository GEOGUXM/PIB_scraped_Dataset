      Inclusion of Castes in OBC Lists
      Posted On: 05 FEB 2019 4:16PM by PIB Delhi


    Inclusion of castes/communities in the Central List of OBCs is a continuous process. Proposals have been received from various States during the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 for inclusion of castes/communities in the Central List of OBCs. The State-wise and year-wise status is given below. At present, no proposal for inclusion of caste/community from State/UT is pending with the Government.


    The National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) constituted w.e.f. 15.08.2018 by insertion of new article viz. article 338B in the Constitution, similar to article 338, applicable for National Commission for Scheduled Castes and article 338A applicable for National Commission for Scheduled Tribes, would have the powers and responsibilities that of NCSC for SCs and NCST for STs including power to advice on inclusion in the Central List of OBCs.


    No such advice received from erstwhile National Commission for Backward Classes is pending with the Government. The Commission to Examine Sub-categorization of Other Backward Classes is mandated to submit its report by 31.05.2019.
