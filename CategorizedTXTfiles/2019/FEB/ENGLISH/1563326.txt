      Posted On: 07 FEB 2019 5:28PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government is committed for holistic development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) across the country. Accordingly, a separate scheme namely “Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)” is being administered by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs for their welfare. The scheme is flexible as it enables the States to focus on areas that they consider is relevant to PVTGs and their socio-cultural environment. It includes sectors such as education, housing, land distribution, land development, agricultural development, animal husbandry, construction of link roads, installation of non-conventional sources of energy for lighting purpose, social security or any other innovative activity meant for the comprehensive socio-economic development of PVTGs.


    The funds are released to States/UT in accordance with the annual programme proposed for a particular financial year. The funds are sanctioned to the State Government on submitting their annual Conservation-cum-Development (CCD) Plan which is considered for appraisal and approval by a Project Appraisal Committee (PAC) in the Ministry. The implementation of the scheme is done by the respective State Governments. No reports regarding PVTGs being deprived of basic social security benefits or having been excluded due to Aadhar linking have been received in the Ministry.
