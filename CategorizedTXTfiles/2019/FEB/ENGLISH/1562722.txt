    In order to avert terror incidents in the country, there exists a close and effective coordination between intelligence and security agencies at the Centre and the State level. The Multi Agency Centre (MAC) has been strengthened and re-organized to enable it to function on 24x7 basis for real time collation and sharing of intelligence with other Intelligence Agencies and State Governments. With a view to enhance the capacity of State forces, the Central Agencies have been organising training programmes for the States forces to collect, collate, analyse and disseminate intelligence from counter terrorism perspective and investigation of terror cases. States have also raised special forces to deal with terror incidents and Central Armed Police Forces and National Security Guards have also been stationed at different locations to assist the States in dealing with such incidents.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.
