      Inclusion of ‘Teli’ Caste in the List of Scheduled Tribes
      Posted On: 07 FEB 2019 5:31PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government of India on 15.6.1999 (further amended on 25.6.2002) has laid down the modalities for deciding the claims for inclusion in, exclusion from and other modifications in Orders specifying Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes lists. As per the modalities, only those proposals which have been recommended and justified by the concerned State Government / UT Administration and concurred with by Registrar General of India (RGI) and National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) are to be considered and legislation amended.


    Government of Jharkhand has sent the proposal for inclusion of Kolh (Teli) community in Scheduled Tribes list of Jharkhand. However, the ethnographic report in support of the proposal was not sent by Government of Jharkhand. As per extant modalities, recommendation of State Government with ethnographic report in support of the proposal is pre-requisite.


    This information was given by Shri Sudarshan Bhagat, Minister of State for Tribal Affairs in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
