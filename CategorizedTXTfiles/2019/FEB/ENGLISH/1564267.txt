      Atomic Energy based Power
      Posted On: 13 FEB 2019 5:37PM by PIB Delhi


    The share of atomic energy in the overall electricity generation in the country was about 2.93% in the year 2017-18.


    The Government has taken several measures to enhance the generation from nuclear power plants in the country. The measures include

     1. Securing fuel supply by conclusion of fuel supply contracts with several countries for existing and future fleet of reactors under IAEA Safeguards and augmentation of fuel supplies from domestic sources.

    (ii) Augmenting nuclear power capacity:

     1. Resolution of issues related to Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act & Creation of Indian Nuclear Insurance Pool (INIP).

     1. Accord of administrative approval and financial sanction of - ten (10) indigenous 700 MW Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) to be set up in fleet mode & two (02) units of Light Water Reactors (LWRs) to be set up in cooperation with Russian Federation.


     1. Amendment of the Atomic Energy Act to enable Joint Ventures of Public Sector Companies to set up nuclear power projects.


     1. Enhanced project monitoring to identify and address the issues affecting project progress at multiple levels coupled with close monitoring through Pro-Active Governance And Timely Implementation “PRAGATI” platform.


    The completion cost of Indigenous 700 MW PHWR in the year 2017 is about ₹ 15 crore per MW.


    New nuclear power capacity is planned to be added in order to increase the share of generation of electricity through atomic energy. In this connection, nine reactors with a capacity of 6700 MW are under construction. The details are as follows:
