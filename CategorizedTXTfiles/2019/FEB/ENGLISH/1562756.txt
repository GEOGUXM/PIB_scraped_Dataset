    The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh has said the Government is committed to complete the NRC process within the stipulated time and ensure that neither any Indian national’s name is excluded nor any foreigner’s name included in the Final NRC.


    In a statement here today, he said that the Government led by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has carried forward the NRC process. After signing of the Assam Accord in 1985, he said the Centre and the State Government of Assam have completed the NRC work that remained pending for more than thirty years and took it to the final stage. The Home Minister added that the complete NRC draft was published on July 30, 2018 and thereafter the Claims and Objections process has also been completed by December 31, 2018.


    Shri Rajnath Singh said that the Home Ministry has made available necessary funds and resources to the State Government so that the NRC work is completed in a time bound and impartial manner. He added that Central Armed Forces in required numbers have been deployed in the State over the last one-and-a-half years to maintain law and order in view of the enormity of the NRC exercise.
