As per the scheme guidelines of schemes “Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution” and “Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS)”, 10 – 15% of the total fund allocation has to be for activities related to health sector like addition to / strengthening of building infrastructure of CHC/PHC, Mobile dispensaries in remote locations, conduct of screening for acute health problems like Sickle Cell Anemia amongst the tribal students and provision of health cards, focus on eradication of prevalent endemic health problems like Malaria, Leprosy, TB, etc. These schemes are demand driven and funds are released to State Governments based on State Plan and approval of the Project Appraisal Committee (PAC).

    The Ministry of Tribal Affairs has no specific scheme for construction of Colleges and Hospitals, but it plays a gap filling role to activities of the line ministries and also supports the State Governments and Union Territory Administrations in construction of Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRS), Ashram Schools, Primary Health Centres, Sub Centres & Community Health Centres through its schemes of Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub Schemes, Grant under Article 275(1) of the Constitution, etc. However Ministry of Tribal Affairs does not maintain any data on the overall number of schools, colleges and hospitals constructed in the country. In so far as Ministry of Tribal Affairs is concerned, 288 EMRSs and 1205 Ashram Schools have been sanctioned till date.


    As per Rural Health Statistics 2018, there is a shortfall in health infrastructure in tribal areas as on 31 st March, 2018, which is as below:-

                                                       
Health Infrastructure    Required  Available  Shortfall

Primary Health Centre    4675      3971       1187     
                                                       
                                                       
                                                       
Community Health Centre  1156      1017       257      
                                                       
                                                       

    Note: The requirement has been calculated using the prescribed norms on the basis of rural population from Census 2011. All India shortfall is derived by adding state-wise figures of shortfall ignoring the existing surplus in some states.


    This information was given by Shri Jaswantsinh Bhabhor , Minister of State for Tribal Affairs in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
