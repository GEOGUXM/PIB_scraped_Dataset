      Cross Border Infiltration
      Posted On: 05 FEB 2019 5:27PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government has adopted a multipronged approach to check infiltration by patrolling; sharing of intelligence and conduct of joint operations; erection of border fencing; installation of border floodlights; use of water crafts/boats and floating Border Out Posts (BOPs) for domination of riverine area of the border; liaison with police, intelligence agencies, local government agencies; laying nakas; establishment of observation posts and using surveillance equipments like Night Vision Devices (NVDs); Hand Held Thermal Imagers (HHTIs); Long Range Recce Observation Systems (LORROS), etc for effective technical surveillance. Additionally, Mobile Vehicle Check Posts (MVCPs), Area Domination Patrols (ADPs), short and long range patrols along the border are being launched on regular basis and review of vulnerability mapping of BOPs from the point of infiltration are carried out. However, due to hostile, mountainous terrain and porous nature of the border, some incidents of infiltration were reported during the last three years as per details given below:-

    Based on threat perception and security requirements, the fencing/ floodlighting has been erected along India-Pakistan and India Bangladesh borders only. The status of fencing and floodlighting, State-wise and border-wise along the Indo-Bangladesh and Indo-Pakistan border is given below:-
