      Facilities for Construction Labourers

    The State-wise number of building or other construction workers, registered with the State Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Boards under Section 12 of the Building and Other Construction Workers’ (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996 is given at Annexure-I.


    Section 34 of the Act makes it mandatory for the employer to provide, free of charges and within the work site or as near to it as may be possible, temporary living accommodation, with separate cooking place, bathing, washing and lavatory facilities, to all building workers employed by him for such period as the building or other construction work is in progress. Further, in order to mitigate hardships that a BOC worker faces while in search of work, the States have been advised to take proactive steps to facilitate transit accommodation/labour shed cum night shelter, mobile toilets and mobile creches to such BOC workers out of the State BOCW welfare cess fund as prescribed. As the Act provides for State BOCW welfare cess fund for which a cess is levied and collected at the rate of 1% of the cost of construction by the State Governments under the Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Cess Act, 1996, assistance/aid is not provided by the State and Central Governments out of their Budget.
