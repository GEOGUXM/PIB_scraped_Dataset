    So far as NMDFC is concerned, no such reference has been received. In order to cut down on waiting time for sanction of loan for the applicant, NMDFC has given full authority to the SCAs, for sanction & disbursement of loan. Further, the SCAs have also been advised to reduce the lead time, between submission of application form by the applicant to sanction of loan by the SCA and release of loan directly through Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) in the bank account, immediately after completion of disbursement formalities by the identified beneficiary.


    Following steps have been introduced to strengthen the functioning of NMDFC for effective implementation of its schemes:-


     1. Providing Grant-In-Aid assistance by the Ministry of Minority Affairs for strengthening the infrastructure & operational capability of State Channelising Agencies (SCAs), for effective implementation of NMDFC schemes.
