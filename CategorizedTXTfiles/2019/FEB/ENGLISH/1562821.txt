      Posted On: 06 FEB 2019 3:09PM by PIB Delhi


    As on 01.02.2019, Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) have released more than 6.31 crore LPG connections against the target of 8 crore under Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) and period of implementation of the PMUY is upto 31.03.2020.


    The major steps taken by OMCs to encourage the LPG usage among the PMUY beneficiaries are:â€“


    (i) offering swap facility i.e. to avail small package 5 kg refill against 14.2 kg refill as per their requirement.


    (ii) conducting Pradhan Mantri LPG Panchayat to educate beneficiaries on benefits of sustained use of LPG and safe usage.


    (iii) deferring the loan recovery from subsidy for the first six refills or one year, whichever is earlier.


    (iv) launching audio visual media campaign to spread awareness on advantages of use of LPG.


    (v) targeted SMS campaign to reach to beneficiaries who have not comeback for refill.


    (vi) display campaign by way of banners, standees and hoardings at public places.


    (vii) undertaking consumer awareness activities viz. school/college student level education programmes, quizzes, drawing competitions, nukkadnataks, walkathon, cyclothon etc.


    (viii) setting up more than 4900 new distributorships in the last three years to strengthen supply chain network especially in rural areas.


    This information was given by Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha today.
