    The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved Kanpur Metro Rail Project having two corridors, which will connect major public nodes and city cluster areas of Kanpur. Implementation of Metro Rail System will result in less vehicular traffic and better movement on the roads leading to reduction in congestion, travel time, cost of journey and pollution. The Metro Rail System will also promote transit oriented development which will lead to development of more residential and commercial complexes along the corridors.

    Background:


    Kanpur is among one of the largest cities in Uttar Pradesh with estimated population of around 41 Lakh. It has historical importance with large scale industrial and commercial activities. Urbanization and rapid growth of vehicular traffic has lead severe stress on the urban transport system in the city resulting also in a deterioration in air quality. In this backdrop, it is imperative to strengthen the public transport system in Kanpur and the Metro project will be able to meet this need. While approving the project, the Cabinet has also stipulated that city bus services in Kanpur should be strengthened within one year of the approval of the Metro Project.
