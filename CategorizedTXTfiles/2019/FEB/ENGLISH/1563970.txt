      Posted On: 12 FEB 2019 1:34PM by PIB Delhi


    The total length of India-Pakistan border in Gujarat is 508 kms, out of which 340 kms only are feasible for construction of physical fencing. 280 kms of physical fencing has been completed and the target for completion of remaining 60 kms is March 2020. The 168 kms of border which is not feasible for physical fencing is being guarded by BSF through patrolling, round the clock surveillance, laying nakas and using technology etc. No infiltration has been reported from 2015 till date in this sector. The contraband activity /smuggling of weapons are also being controlled through effective domination of borders by round the clock surveillance viz., patrolling, laying nakas, manning observation posts all along the International border.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
