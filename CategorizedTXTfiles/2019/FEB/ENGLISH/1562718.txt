      Posted On: 05 FEB 2019 5:23PM by PIB Delhi


    State Governments have enacted legislations on the subject and some State Governments allow slaughter of cow with varying conditions.


    ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and State Governments are responsible for prevention, detection, registration and investigation of crime and for prosecuting the criminals through their law enforcement agencies. State Governments are also competent to enact legislation in this behalf. The Ministry of Home Affairs have issued advisories to States and UTs from time to time, to maintain law and order and ensure that any person who takes law into his/her own hand is punished promptly as per law. The Ministry of Home Affairs have issued an advisory on 09.08.2016 to all States/UTs for taking prompt and strict action against miscreants who take law into their own hands in the name of protection of cow. Further, advisories dated 23.07.2018 and 25.09.2018 were issued to the State Governments/UTs Administration in pursuance to the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s Judgement dated 17.07.2018 in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 754/2016, incorporating the key directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court for taking measures by States/UTs to curb incidents of mob lynching in the country. Government through audio-visual media has generated public awareness to curb the menace of mob lynching.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.
