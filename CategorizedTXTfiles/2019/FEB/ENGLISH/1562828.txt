    PMKVY 2016-20 does not mandate the establishment of skill development centres, however, enables large number of prospective youth for taking up Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) through accredited and affiliated training centers (TCs) throughout the country. Under the scheme, for imparting the skill training, the accreditation and affiliation of TCs are being done under single window IT application known as SMART.
