    CRPF personnel are not deployed at LoC and IB along Pakistan.


    The following measures have been taken by the Government to check ceasefire violations by Pakistan: -


     1. Proper defence preparedness (including strengthening of Nakas, field fortifications, high mast lights etc.) is ensured on the International Border.

     2. BSF regularly interacts with border population situated close to border and educates them not to move in vicinity of areas prone to unprovoked fire without prior information / permission of BSF. Efforts are also made to inform the villagers on occurrence of cross-border firing.
     3. All violations of ceasefire are taken up with Pakistan authorities at the appropriate levels, through established mechanisms.
     4. Diplomatically, India has repeatedly emphasized, including at the highest level, the need for Pakistan to uphold the sanctity of the Line of Control (LC) and abide by the ceasefire commitments along the International Border and LC.

    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
