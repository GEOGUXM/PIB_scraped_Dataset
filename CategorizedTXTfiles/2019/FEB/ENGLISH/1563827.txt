      Posted On: 11 FEB 2019 4:05PM by PIB Delhi


    Ministry of Tribal Affairs provides financial assistance to the Tribal students to get higher education inter-alia in engineering, technology and science under the following schemes:


     1. Post Matric Scholarships to ST Students.

     2. National Overseas Scholarships for ST candidates.
     3. National Fellowship & Scholarship for Higher Education of ST Students.

    Under the scheme of National Overseas Scholarships for ST candidates and National Fellowship & Scholarship for Higher Education, there is no state-wise release of funds. Hence, year-wise number of beneficiaries covered and fund released under the two schemes alongwith State-wise release of funds and beneficiaries covered including the State of Madhya Pradesh during the last three years and current year under Post Matric Scholarship Scheme is furnished below .


    Under the scheme of National Overseas Scholarships for ST candidates, this Ministry provides financial assistance to students for pursuing higher studies abroad. The students are required to pursue their respective studies in a country of choice and are required to make their own efforts in seeking admission in accredited Universities/ institutions in programmes/fields specified in the scheme. This Ministry strives to provide clarifications and guidance to prospective candidates wherever it is sought to ensure a smooth process.
