      Suresh Prabhu addressing Board of Trade meeting in New Delhi


      Minister for Commerce & Industry and Civil Aviation, Suresh Prabhu, chaired a meeting of the Board of Trade (BOT) today at VigyanBhawan. The meeting was attended by Commerce Secretary, Secretary DPIIT, DGFT, Secretaries and other senior officials of key line ministries including, Finance and Agriculture, all major trade and industry bodies, Export Promotion Councils and industrialists.


      On this occasion, Commerce & Industry Minister launched a new online “Anytime-Anywhere” export awareness course to train, mentor and hand-hold potential exporters so as to help them to tap international trade opportunities. This Online Course has been funded under the ‘NiryatBandhu’ scheme of DGFT and is in collaboration with the Indian Ins titute of Foreign Trade, New Delhi. On successful completion, a Certificate in Export Import Management under NiryatBandhu Scheme will be awarded to participants.


      In another e-initiative, Commerce Minister also launched a Mobile App of DGFT. Exporters can now log their grievances, apply for various licenses, view their status using this app, besides accessing information about latest trade notices, circulars, Foreign Trade Policy and trade fairs.


      In his address, Commerce Secretary, Dr. AnupWadhawan welcomed the delegates to the Board of Trade and mentioned that India’s exports have faced a very challenging period in recent years, on account of developments arising from the global financial crisis of 2008-09, which accentuated after 2013-14, when the world economy, including China experienced a major trade slowdown. Thus, after achieving a turnaround from the initial shock and reaching a peak export figure of US$ 314.4 billion in 2013-14, our exports came under immense pressure again in the post 2013-14 period due to accentuation of the global economic / financial crisis in the second phase when countries like China also got adversely affected. However, since then concerted efforts through improved logistics, trade facilitation, increased digitization to reduce human interface and increase transparency, implementation of GST, capacity building through skilling etc., the government has been able to arrest the downturn affecting India. As a result, barring a few stray months, our merchandise exports have been growing on a secular basis since 2016-17 for almost three years and are likely to reach a new peak in 2018-19.
