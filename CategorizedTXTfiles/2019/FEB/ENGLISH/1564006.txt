    A delegation led by Additional Secretary Steel visited Canada recently to participate in the safeguard inquiry on Stainless Steel Wire (SSW) and Energy Tubular Products (ETP).


    Canada has imposed provisional safeguard measures in the form of Tariff Rate Quota against the imports of seven product categories of steel. Canada has also initiated safeguard inquiry and requested submissions from interested parties. Since Indian exporters have a huge stake in two product categories, namely SSW and ETP, Ministry of Steel decided to participate in the inquiry.


    Governments of Korea, Thailand, Mexico, Romania and Brazil also submitted their oral arguments in the safeguard inquiry of ETP.


    It is expected that the tribunal will come out with the report along with recommendations on 3 rd April 2019.
