      Posted On: 08 FEB 2019 5:58PM by PIB Delhi


    Union Minister of State in the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation and Minister of State in the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs Vijay Goel responded to a written question in Rajya Sabha today on Status of ongoing Infrastructure Projects.


    Following is the response given by the Minister:


    The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation monitors on-going Central Sector Infrastructure Projects costing Rs. 150 crore and above on time and cost overruns, on the basis of information provided by the project implementing agencies. As on 01.12.2018, a total of 1443 projects were on the monitor of this Ministry. Of these, 347 projects are showing cost overruns.


    The causes for cost overruns are project-specific, depend on a variety of technical, financial and administrative factors, and differ from project to project. However, as reported by the project implementing agencies on this Ministryâ€™s OCMS, the main reasons for cost overrun of the Projects are: law and order problems, delay in land acquisition, delay in environment and forest clearances, funding constraints, rehabilitation and resettlement issues, local body / municipal permissions, utility shifting, contractual issues, etc.


    The details of such projects are available in the flash report at http://www.cspm.gov.in/english/publication.html .


    As on 01.12.2018, out of total 1443 projects, 360 are running behind their schedule of completion. The details of such delay projects are available in the flash report at http://www.cspm.gov.in/english/publication.html.


    The major steps undertaken to ensure completion of Central Sector Infrastructure Projects without time and cost overruns include; Periodic review of projects under PRAGATI through video conferencing; rigorous project appraisal; On-line Computerized Monitoring System (OCMS) for better monitoring; setting up of Revised Cost Committees in the Ministries for fixation of responsibility for time and cost overruns; regular review of infrastructure projects by the concerned administrative Ministries; and setting up of Central Sector Projects Coordination Committees (CSPCCs) in the States under the Chief Secretaries for removal of bottlenecks and for facilitating the speedy implementation of major projects.
