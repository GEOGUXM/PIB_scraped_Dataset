      A statement showing the deployment and payment state-wise is enclosed as Annexure.


      Govt. has not decided to discontinue the system of contract labour in FCI.

       1. Contract labourers are deployed only in those depots where engagement of contract labour has not been banned by the Govt. of India (Ministry of Labour) by a notification issued under section 10 of the Contract Labour (R&A) Act, 1970.
       2. There is no violation of any directives as contract labour are not deployed in any depot where the Government/Ministry of Labour has banned deployment of contract labour under the provisions of Section 10 of CL(R&A) Act.
       3. Direct Payment labour System (DPS) is governed by the settlements signed with the labour unions from time to time. Hence, question of their regularization does not arise.
       4. Contract workers are employees of the contractor and there is no employer and employee relationship between the FCI and the contract workers.

      Nodal officers have been appointed at field level to ensure compliance with all the welfare measures to regulate the working conditions of contract labours and to ensure better facilities and adequate welfare provisions like EPF, Minimum Wages, ESI, Workmen Compensation etc., and facilities like canteen/restrooms, urinals and provision of drinking water by the contractor as per various labour laws.
