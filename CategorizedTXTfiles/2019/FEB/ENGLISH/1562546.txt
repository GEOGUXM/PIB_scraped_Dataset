      Cleaning Programme for River Ganga
      Posted On: 04 FEB 2019 4:19PM by PIB Delhi


    Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had carried out Biological Water Quality Monitoring (BWQM) at 41 locations along main stem of river Ganga from Haridwar Barrage, Uttarakhand to Garden Reach, West Bengal during Pre-monsoon (April –June, 2017) and 39 locations during Post-monsoon (December 2017 – March, 2018). A draft report based on preliminary bio-monitoring study was prepared on the basis of biological parameters using benthic macro-invertebrates as indicator organisms following Biological Water Quality Criteria (BWQC).


    The first round of monitoring was conducted in 2014-15 to formulate Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) as well as understand the baseline status. Depending on the findings of 2014-15, similar exercise was carried out during 2015-16 to validate the findings and classify the river water quality status using the Biological Water Quality Criteria developed by CPCB based on combination of internationally accepted parameters viz. Saprobic Score and Diversity Score. However, BWQC has not been notified by the Government. BWQC is qualitative criteria rather than quantitative and making any inference on qualitative assessment requires detailed collaboration with physico-chemical quality findings also which is quantitative parametric monitoring.


    As per the assessment in the draft report, biological water quality at Haridwar barrage

    (UK-6) was found to be Clean (BWQC Class A) in Post-monsoon of 2017-18. The biological water quality of main stream of River Ganga remains stable in the entire stretch (Moderate Pollution category; BWQC Class C) except for 3 locations downstream of Jagjeetpur STP; downstream of Kannauj after confluence with River Ramganga and River East Kali and Pandu river where biological water quality was found to be Heavy (BWQC Class D) in Post-Monsoon 2017-18 due to pollution/surface runoff.


    Funds are being remitted to states based on their funds demand. The detail of funds released to State during last three financial years and in current financial year (till 31 December 2018) for Ganga basin is tabulated below:-

    (* up to 31 December 2018)


    Cleaning of river is a continuous process and the Government of India is supplementing the efforts of the State Governments by providing financial assistance. The Central Government approved the ''Namami Gange'' Program on 13th May, 2015 with an outlay of Rs 20,000 crore as a comprehensive approach to rejuvenate the river Ganga and its tributaries, under one umbrella, by consolidating the existing ongoing efforts and planning for a concrete action plan for the future. The Namami Gange Programme covers short term, medium term and long term activities. Under short term, certain entry level activities which cover development of ghats crematoria & river surface cleaning activities etc have been taken up. Under Medium term activities, existing Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) and Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) are being upgraded and new STPs & ETPs are being established. Beside, rural sanitation has been taken up in the villages on the banks of river Ganga. The long term action plan involves restoration of wholesomeness of river Ganga and maintaining the ecological & geological integrity of river. Namami Gange Programme is being executed by State Project Management Group (SPMG) in each Ganga main stem state and during the implementation of projects bottlenecks like delay in tendering process, retendering, non-availability of land, legal issues, delay in permission from local authorities on road cutting/crossing etc. are encountered. The issues are resolved through continuous coordination with the state government at various levels, field visits and quarterly monitoring. Further in order to ensure effective implementation and timely completion of projects, project management consultants/supervision consultants are being appointed by the state government. All these schemes are targeted to be completed by scheduled time.


    This information was given by Union Minister of State for Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Dr. Satya Pal Singh in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
