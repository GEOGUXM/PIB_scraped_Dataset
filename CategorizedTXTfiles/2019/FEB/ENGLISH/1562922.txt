      Posted On: 06 FEB 2019 7:40PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government had constituted a Committee to review the recommendations of the previous Commissions and Committees set up on Police Reforms in December 2004. The Committee was mandated to shortlist the recommendations which had not been implemented or partially implemented. The Committee submitted its report in March 2005. One of the recommendations of the Committee pertained to enactment of a New Police Act to replace the Police Act of 1861. The Ministry of Home Affairs set up an Expert Committee, Chaired by Dr. Soli Sorabjee, to draft a new Model Police Act in September 2005. The Committee submitted a Model Police Act on 30.10.2006 after extensive consultations. A copy of the same was sent to State Governments on 31.10.2006 with the request to frame a new State Police Act or amend the existing Act on the basis of the Model Police Act, 2006.


    Further, “Police” is a State subject falling in List-II (State List) of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. It is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments to formulate new Police Act or amend their existing Act on the lines of draft Model Police Act prepared by the Central Government.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to question in the Rajya Sabha today.
