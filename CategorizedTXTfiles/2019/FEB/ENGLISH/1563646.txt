      Posted On: 09 FEB 2019 2:45PM by PIB Delhi


    My dear brothers and sisters!


    The rising sun is a symbol of energy, hope and aspirations. Arunachal is named after the sun. It is the land of the rising sun. As a result, this land is also a symbol of the trust of the entire country. Arunachal boosts our faith, and further strengthens our resolve. I have come here several times in the last 55 months. One of the reasons is definitely your blessings. Besides, I love coming to Arunachal Pradesh because it keeps on inspiring me to work for the nation with a new energy and freshness. It gives me immense pleasure and a new zeal when every citizen greets with a 'Jai Hind!' And today I once again salute this land that has made 'Jai Hind' a part of its life.


    Friends,


    For the past 55 months, the NDA Government at the Center and the BJP Government led by our friend Khandu Ji here have been working with utmost sincerity and honesty to empower the lives of all of you in Arunachal. Even today, I got the opportunity to lay the foundation stone and inaugurating the projects worth more than Rs. 4 thousand crores which would empower Arunachal Pradesh.


    Besides these projects, work is going on for the projects worth about Rs.13 thousand crores in your state at a rapid pace. These projects will not only improve connectivity of Arunachal Pradesh but will also strengthen the power sector of the state. These projects will not only improve the healthcare services of the state, but will also promote the cultural heritage of Arunachal Pradesh. Many congratulations to all of you for these projects.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Compare the 55 years of one party after independence and the 55 months of our tenure. You will get a clear picture of the work done for Arunachal and the entire Northeast.


    Arunachal has rich water resources. It has an unprecedented capacity to generate electricity, but the development was not taking place at the pace it should have taken place. It has been an important area associated with the security of the country. It has been an important area strategically. Yet the necessary facilities have not been developed here. The situation was such that nobody cared for the young men here, nor the soldiers at the border were taken care of.


    Friends,


    The previous governments paid very little attention to the fact that the people of this region were facing so many difficulties as a result of the neglect of the area. You have been demanding modern infrastructure in all the areas including Arunachal Pradesh for decades, but the previous governments did not even care for it. Friends, this government is constantly trying to change this situation. I have been reiterating time and again that New India will be able to develop to its full potential only when East India, the North East develops at a rapid pace. This development refers to the development not only of the resources but also of the cultural pride. This development is also to connect different regions and the people.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Following the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas', shortage of funds was never allowed to come in the way for the development of Arunachal Pradesh and the Northeast in the last 55 months. There was not even any lack of will power for the same. During the past few years, funds to the tune of Rs.44 thousand crores have been given to the states; which is double the amount given by the previous governments. Besides, the central government is also working on other projects worth thousands of crores of rupees here. In the same sequence of development, today the inauguration and foundation stone ceremony of the two airports respectively are being held in Arunachal Pradesh. Probably this is the first time that the work has been started on another airport as soon as the work has been finished on one airport in any state in India. This is an important occasion for Arunachal Pradesh because in all these years after independence there was not a single airport where large passenger planes could land regularly. There was connectivity of the airport only till Guwahati and from there you had to travel either by road, or under compulsion, in case of an emergency by helicopters.


    Friends,


    The Tezu airport is ready to provide services to the general public from today. The Tezu airport was built about 50 years ago. At that time, nobody had thought that the airport could also be used for connecting the people of Arunachal with the rest of the country. Our government has expanded this small airport by spending about Rs. 125 crores and has set up modern provisions. Now Arunachal Pradesh will be connected to Guwahati, Jorhat and Walong by air. And let me tell you that Arunachal Pradesh is so rich in natural resources, and the people of Delhi and other cities will be stupefied just by getting to see the different varieties of fresh flowers here.


    With the airport getting ready, we can carry fruits and flowers to the big markets of the country in just a few hours. My farmer brothers will be able to earn more.


    Friends,


    Just a few months back, commercial flights have been started for Arunachal. Now this expansion of the airport will give you double benefits. The government is trying to provide the people of Arunachal Pradesh with low cost air travels under the UDAN scheme. Friends, the foundation stone of Hollongi Greenfield airport worth approximately Rs.1000 crores has been laid today. Just a few months back, I had got the opportunity to inaugurate the North East's first Greenfield Pakyong airport. I assure you that the second Greenfield airport of North East will also be inaugurated on time. And you all are aware of the fact that the foundation stone of a project laid by us is also inaugurated by us.


    Friends,


    Besides airways, the connectivity of Arunachal with the rest of the nation is getting strengthened also with roadways and railways. Efforts will be made to construct the tunnel as soon as possible at a cost of about seven crore rupees. When this tunnel is built, it will be easy to reach Tawang from Balipada. The problem of your movement in every season throughout the year will be solved. Recently, the longest rail-road bridge of India, the Bogibeel Bridge over Brahmaputra River has also been inaugurated. Because of this, many areas of Arunachal Pradesh are also getting immense benefits.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Be it the connectivity of villages, cities or with other states in Arunachal Pradesh, the central government is working on projects worth crores of rupees today. Under this, not only are new national highways being constructed at a cost of about 50 thousand crore rupees, but about one thousand villages have also been connected with roads in the last two years. Trans Arunachal highway is being constructed speedily at a cost of about 4 thousand crore rupees.


    Friends,


    Besides road connectivity, unprecedented work is being done in the railway sector in the state of Arunachal Pradesh. As a part of the campaign to connect the capitals of every state of the North East with the railways, Itanagar has also been connected with the railways. The Arunachal AC express, which runs between Naharlagun and Delhi, now runs twice a week. Besides, survey is being done at seven places to expand the railway network throughout Arunachal Pradesh. Survey has been completed at three of these places. A major plan to connect Tawang to the rail network is also in progress.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Besides highways, railways and airways, electricity connectivity is also important. Today, I congratulate Arunachal Pradesh for becoming a state that provides electricity to almost every family under the Saubhagya Scheme. I congratulate the Chief Minister, and his entire team. What Arunachal has achieved today is going to be achieved by the entire country very soon. Under the Saubhagya Scheme, in the last one to one-and-a-half years, darkness has been dispelled from the houses of about two and a half crore families in the country, and free electricity connection has been given.


    Friends,


    Our government is also emphasizing upon power generation to deliver sufficient electricity besides providing electricity connection. Today a 110 MW Pare Hydroelectric Plant has been inaugurated, which will provide electricity to not only Arunachal but also to the other states of North East India. At the same time, work of about three thousand crore rupees has also started from today to improve the transmission system. This will provide electricity to remote areas of the state. Also, another major task will be the connection of the power system here to the grid. Friends, when basic facilities like connectivity and electricity are brought to a state, it not only makes the lives of ordinary human beings easy there, but the tourism sector also gets a boost. Tourism is a sector where everyone gets to earn. The guide earns, the hotelier earns, the taxi driver earns, the shopkeeper earns, the toy vendor earns, the florist earns, and the tea vendor also earns.


    Yesterday I had tweeted about the beauty of North East, the possibilities of North East tourism, and I had requested people to share photos of their experiences of visit to the North East. I am surprised that in a few seconds, thousands of people tweeted their photos and experiences of their Northeast visit on Twitter. How can tourism be promoted? The people from abroad have also tweeted. If you check out that hash tag, you will also be surprised how the country and the world are proud of you.


    There is no dearth of natural beauty in Arunachal. There is no dearth of places related to religion, devotion and spirituality here. After the construction of the new Airport and new railway lines, the number of tourists from India and abroad will increase. It will also create employment opportunities for the youth here and will boost the economy of Arunachal.


    Brothers and sisters,


    The central government is committed to develop, preserve and protect the culture, language, food and lifestyle of every region. India's diversity is her precious treasure; it is our pride and it is inherent in BJP's ideology itself. This is the reason why our government has launched 24-hour TV channel Arun Prabha to boost the culture of Arunachal. All the modern facilities have been provided here for your channel. Due to this channel, news of far-flung areas of the state will also reach you more quickly. I hope that the channel will help in spreading Arunachal's culture and traditions and will introduce the people of the whole country to the beauty of Arunachal. Similarly, the Film and Television Institute to be built in Jote will provide new opportunities for the youth here; and at the same time the culture here will get a better expression.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Our government is working towards the five streams of development i.e. education for the children, income for the youth, medicines for the elderly, irrigation for the farmers and addressing public grivances. Historic work has been undertaken especially in the health sector of the country, to provide affordable and best quality healthcare services to the people. Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, health and wellness centres are being set up and free treatment in the hospitals for serious diseases of the poor is being ensured.


    Friends,


    The 50 Health and Wellness Centres that have been inaugurated here today will not only provide health benefits to the remote areas but will also identify serious diseases in the initial stages. The health and wellness centers will be especially beneficial for the pregnant women and during emergency cases.


    Friends,


    The poor people of Arunachal Pradesh are also getting the benefits of Ayushman Bharat PMJAY or Modicare like the rest of the country. Under this scheme, up to Rs.5 lakhs will be provided to a poor family per year in case of a serious ailment. It has not yet been 150 days, about 11 lakh people in the country have already availed the benefits of treatment under this scheme. I was told that the Pema Khandu government has been expanding the efforts of this government.


    Friends,


    Besides taking care of the health of the common man, another major scheme has been announced in this year's budget for boosting the financial strength of the farmers - PM Kisan Samman Nidhi. Under this scheme, every year every farmer family with 5 Acres of land or less will receive Rs.6000 into their bank accounts from the central government in Delhi. It will be done every year. The amount will be deposited in three instalments of Rs.2000 each so that it can be linked to cultivation. It will also benefit several farmers of Arunachal Pradesh.


    Brothers and sisters,


    We are not only trying to boost the agriculture but also striving to promote organic cultivation. I was told that the government here is working in this direction at a rapid pace. And I want to assure you that the central government will support you completely.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Arunachal Pradesh is the pride of our nation. It is also a gateway to India's development and security. The BJP governments will continue to strengthen this gateway. With your blessings this Prime Servant is committed to turn this entire region including Arunachal into a developed region. Once again, I congratulate my dear brothers and sisters of Arunachal for the launch of various projects here. The people of Arunachal who have the slogan of 'Jai Hind' on their lips should say along with me -


    Jai Hind! Jai Hind!


    Jai Hind! Jai Hind!


    Jai Hind! Jai Hind!


    Thanks a lot!!
