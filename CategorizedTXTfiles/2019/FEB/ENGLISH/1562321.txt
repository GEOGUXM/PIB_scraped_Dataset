    Union Finance Minister Shri Piyush Goyal today announced key initiatives taken by the Government in the films sector in the Interim Budget 2019-20.


    Hailing the entertainment industry as a major employment generator, he declared that the provision of single window clearance system for ease of shooting films, hitherto available only to foreigners, will now be made available to Indian filmmakers as well. The regulatory provisions will rely more on self-regulation.

    He also announced that the Government will introduce anti-camcording provisions in the Cinematograph Act to control the menace of piracy.


    The entertainment industry has appreciated the announcement of single window clearance system as a significant step with a potential to play a role in boosting tourism, while stating that anti-camcording measures will assist in the industryâ€™s growth. The industry also expressed its delight at the acknowledgement by the Finance Minister of its contribution towards employment generation.
