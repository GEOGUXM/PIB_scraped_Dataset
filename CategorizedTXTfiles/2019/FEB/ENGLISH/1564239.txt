    The weapons in category of Assault Rifle, Close Quarter Battle (CQB) Carbine and Light Machine Gun (LMG) are the basic weapons of a soldier. Over a period of time owing to the dynamic nature of warfare, enhanced transparency in battlefield, latest technological advancement and capabilities of adversaries, operational requirements for these Small Arms have undergone a change.


    During 2018, Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for procurement of Assault Rifles, LMGs and CQB carbines through Fast Track Procedure (FTP) under ‘Buy-Global’ category as well as AoNs for procurement of LMG and CQB carbine under ‘Buy & Make (Indian)’ category have been accorded by Defence Acquisition Council (DAC). AoN has also been accorded for Inter Government Agreement (IGA) with Government of Russia for production of Assault Rifles in India through a joint venture. The cases are at various stages of procurement.
