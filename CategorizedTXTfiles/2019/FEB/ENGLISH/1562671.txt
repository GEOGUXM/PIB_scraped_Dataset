    Prince Albert II of Monaco called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (February 5, 2019).


    Welcoming Prince Albert to India, the President said that India and Monaco have always enjoyed a relationship of trust, friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation. The current visit imparts a strong impetus towards taking the relationship to newer heights.


    The President said that India-Monaco ties are doing well. However, there is scope to do a lot more together. On issues such as renewable energy, climate change and the environment, there is a strong meeting of minds between us. We must prioritise these areas for bilateral cooperation. The President said India is the fastest growing major economy in the world. Monacoâ€™s technology and investment companies can significantly benefit from the Indian growth story.
