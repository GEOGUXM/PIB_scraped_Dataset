    Background:

Further the Parliament has been adjourned sine die on 13th February, 2019. As per the provisions of Article 107(5) of the Constitution of India, a Bill, which has been passed by the Lok Sabha but is still pending in the Rajya Sabha, shall lapse on dissolution of the Lok Sabha, which is likely to take place in near future.
