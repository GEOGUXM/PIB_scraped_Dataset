    The Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways, Shipping and Chemicals & Fertilizers, Shri Mansukh Mandaviya in a written reply to the Lok Sabha last week informed that the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has initiated Skill Development Program under RPL (Recognition of Prior Learning) scheme to train construction workers in the highway sector. The scheme is being implemented through the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, and guidelines to this effect have been issued by the Ministry.As per the guidelines, the workers are to be trained for Highway Projects costing more than Rs100 Crores. Under this program, 95,000 workmen have been registered till date and 82,000 workmen have been trained in 6 trades i.e. Masonry, Bar bending, Scaffolding, Shuttering/ Carpentry, Plumbing and Painting.


    In another written reply, Shri Mandaviya stated that roads are being constructed in the country by using rubber as a modifier. MoRTH & National Highway Authority of India are contemplating to use rubberized bitumen as per the Indian Roads Congress (IRC) Guidelines,which will improve the quality of roads and will result in lesser wear and tear. He also informed the House that around 3.14 lakhs electric vehicles are presently operating in the country. The Government has taken various steps to encourage the use of electric vehicles which include exemption of battery operated vehicles from the requirement of permit, green background of registration plate of electric vehicles, allowing retro-fitment of hybrid electric system or electric kit to vehicles running on petrol and diesel and issuing guidelines & standards for charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. The increased number of electric vehicles will not only cut the cost of precious fuel but also save the environment from pollution.
