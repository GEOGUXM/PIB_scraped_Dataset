      Agro Meteorological Advisories
      Posted On: 05 FEB 2019 4:27PM by PIB Delhi


    5.13 crore farmers are receiving a gro meteorological advisories through m-kisan portal (https://m-kisan.gov.in). State-wise details regarding number of farmers registered on m-kisan portal for receiving agro advisories including meteorological advisories are at Annexure.


    25 centres of All India Coordinated Research Project on Agrometeorology (AICRPAM) located in State Agriculture Universities, distributed across the country have made efforts to issue Agromet advisories through Radio, TV, Newspapers etc. in local languages. Agromet bulletins to Line Departments of various state Governments are also distributed by the AICRPAM. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and India Meteorological Department (IMD) have jointly planned to augment the Agromet Advisory System (AAS) network to sub-district (block) level. Under this plan, 200 Krishi Vigyan Kendras including the 110 Aspirational districts have been identified for setting up of District Agro-Met Units (DAMUs) to provide Agromet services to farmers. The initial fund of Rs. 2.4 cr. (@ Rs.1.2 lakh per unit) has been sanctioned for establishing the required facilities to start the advisory services.


    Further, several awareness campaigns have been undertaken to encourage farmers to register themselves on m-kisan portal and receive crop and weather specific advisories. Many farmers have been registered through Kisan Call Centre also. Farmers can call and get themselves registered for receiving crop advisories. Extension workers have also played an important role in increasing the registration of farmers. They explain the process of registration and benefits of getting registered to the farmers thereby helping farmers to receive crop and weather based advisories. Expenditure of Rs.26,31,73,386/- has been incurred during the last three years i.e. 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18, on sending advisories through SMS to farmers registered on m-kisan portal


    This information was given by Minister of State for Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Shri Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in Lok Sabha today.
