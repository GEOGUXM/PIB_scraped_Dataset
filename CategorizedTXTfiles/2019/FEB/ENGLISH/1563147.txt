    Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone for the four laning of the Falakata-Salsalabari section of NH -31 D in the northern part of West Bengal tomorrow. This 41.7 km long section of National Highways falls in the Jalpaiguri district of the state, and will be constructed at a cost of about Rs1938 Crore.


    The project will reduce the distance from Salsalabari and Alipurduar to Siliguri by nearly 50 km. This is significant as better access to Siliguri means better access to railways and airways. The National Highway will facilitate better movement of tea and other agricultural produce from the region to markets. The improved connectivity will also lead to an increase in tourism in the region. All this in turn will give a major boost to socio-economic activity in the state, opening up employment opportunities for the local people.


    The National Highway will incorporate all necessary safety features to provide relief to road users. There will be 3 Railway Over Bridges, 2 Flyovers, 3 Vehicular Underpasses, 8 Major Bridges and 17 Minor Bridges on this section of National Highway.
