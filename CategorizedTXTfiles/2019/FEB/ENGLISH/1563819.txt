Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Giriraj Singh, informed while replying to a question in Lok Sabha today.


    He said the MSME Ministry is implementing the Prime Ministerâ€™s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), a major credit-linked subsidy scheme since 2008-09, to set up micro enterprises and to generate employment in rural and urban areas of the country. The maximum cost of the project under PMEGP scheme is Rs.25.00 lakhs for manufacturing sector units and Rs.10.00 lakhs for units under service sector. Under the scheme, women entrepreneurs are covered under Special Category and are entitled to 25% and 35% subsidies for the project set up in urban and rural areas respectively. For women beneficiaries, own contribution is only 5% of the project cost while for general category it is 10%. About 30% projects have been setup by women out of total projects set up under PMEGP. The Minister said Women Entrepreneurs have set up 138516 projects since its inception till 23.01.2019. Details of State-wise projects set up by women are as under:
