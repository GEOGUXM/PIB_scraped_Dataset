      India-Us Case at WTO
      Posted On: 04 FEB 2019 3:58PM by PIB Delhi


    The United States’ unilateral measure of imposition of additional customs duty of 25% on steel products and 10% on aluminium products are violative of the WTO provisions. As these measures affect India’s trade, India has challenged the US before the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) seeking to bring these measures consistent with WTO provisions.


    Since the bilateral consultations under the Dispute Settlement Mechanism held on 20 th July 2018 did not result in resolution of the dispute, a Dispute Settlement Panel was established on 4 December 2018 to adjudicate the dispute.


    This information was given by the Minister of State of Commerce and Industry, C. R. Chaudhary, in written replies in the Lok Sabha today.
