      Targets for Tb Elimination
      Posted On: 05 FEB 2019 4:49PM by PIB Delhi


    For the year 2018 the following has been achieved:


      * In 2018 year, 5, 36,752 TB patients have been notified from private sector. There has been 40% increase in TB notification from private sector as compared to 2017.

      * 44,517 (8%) TB patients were given anti-TB drugs from the programme.
      * As per State reports till 25.01.2019, 40% notified TB patients, 35% treatment supporters and 8% private practitioners have been paid incentives through DBT.

    The shortfall in stated targets, reasons thereof and strategies are as follows:


      * A massive partnership with the private sector has been initiated as Joint Effort for Elimination of Tuberculosis (JEET) for the elimination of TB by 2025, five years ahead of the global schedule. Though the MoU was signed in March 2018, the project was launched in May 2018 and has picked up from October 2018.


      * To increase in notification from private sector, public private support agency approach has been initiated in 85 districts from May 2018 onwards; Indian Medial Association has been engaged for large scale sensitization and advocacy with private practitioners with standardised digital material.


      * States have been supplied anti-TB drugs to covering TB patients notified from private sector based on demand. States have been guided to keep programme provided anti-TB drugs at private practitionerâ€™s clinic or pharmacy

      * Invalid or dormant bank accounts or holding of account in a branch which is yet to be integrated with PFMS (Public Finance Management System) are a few challenges being faced in scheme implementation. To overcome these issues and to ensure that beneficiaries of the schemes are not denied of DBT benefit, flexibility of providing the benefit through existing bank account of a blood relative has been given. States have also been advised to facilitate opening of zero balance accounts for TB patients, if necessary, under the PradhanMantri Jan DhanYojana (PMJDY) and Indian Postal Bank.

    The Government is committed to achieve the target of TB elimination by 2025 and not considering any revision in targets.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), ShriAshwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
