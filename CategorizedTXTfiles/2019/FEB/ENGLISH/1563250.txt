    Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) under Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation had notified revised guidelines vide Gazette notification S.O. 6140(E) dated 12.12.2018 to regulate and control ground water extraction in India, which was proposed to be effective from 01.06.2019. As per these revised guidelines, Water Conservation Fee (WCF) would be levied for use of ground water depending on the category of area, type of industry and quantum of ground water withdrawal. There was no provision for exemption from WCF to Government infrastructure, water supply agencies and mining projects. However, National Green Tribunal (NGT) vide order dated 3 rd January 2019 has directed that the notification may not be given effect and has ordered Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF & CC) to constitute an expert committee by including representatives from IIT Delhi, IIT Roorkee, IIM Ahmedabad, CPCB, Niti Aayog and any other concerned agency or department to examine the issue of appropriate policy for conservation of ground water.
