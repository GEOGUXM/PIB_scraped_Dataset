    State wise data for exports is not published by DGCI&S. The details of state-wise production of mangoes, during the last three years and the current year, are at below.


    Mangoes are processed by the registered packhouse facilities having ripening chambers, pre-cooling facilities and cold storage facilities for shipment to UAE and other West Asian countries. Mangoes to these destinations are exported in refrigerated containers having requisite temperature of 12 ° C. As per industry’s feedback, there is no shortage of availability of refrigerated containers for sea shipment. To the distant destinations like EU and USA, mangoes are exported by air, which reaches the market in two days. To facilitate exports of mangoes by refrigerated vans, Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), under the Infrastructure Development component of its export promotion scheme, provides financial assistance for purchase of insulated/reefer transport/mobile pre cooling units upto 40% of the cost subject to ceiling of Rs.100 lakhs. Assistance for Reefer transport vehicles is also available under Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), a Centrally Sponsored Scheme implemented by Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.


    APEDA, an autonomous organisation under the administrative control of Department of Commerce, has been mandated with the export promotion of Mangoes. As such, no proposal for setting up a Mango Board is under consideration of the Government.


    During 2018, APEDA has organized the following programmes in the importing countries:

    Promotion of exports of agricultural products like mangoes is a continuous process. India has filed Market Access Requests for mangoes with several countries like Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Israel, Malawi, Peru, Russia, Serbia, Uruguay and Uzbekistan. Under the newly introduced Agriculture Export Policy, clusters have been identified in the States of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh for export-oriented production of mangoes. MEIS of 7% is available on the export of mangoes. APEDA also provides assistance to Mango exporters under various components of its export promotion scheme.


    The Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), a Centrally Sponsored Scheme is being implemented w.e.f. 2014-15 by the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, for holistic growth of the horticulture sector covering fruits (including Mango), vegetables, root and tuber crops, mushrooms, spices, flowers, aromatic plants, coconut, cashew, cocoa and bamboo. All states and UTs are covered under MIDH. Under MIDH, credit linked assistance is provided for establishment of Cold Storage, Ripening Chambers and Reefer transport vehicles for perishable horticulture crops including Mango. The component is demand and entrepreneur driven and funds under MIDH are allocated to States on the basis of Annual Action Plans.
