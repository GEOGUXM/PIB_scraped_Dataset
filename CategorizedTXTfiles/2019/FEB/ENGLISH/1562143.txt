    Under MUDRA Yojana, 15.56 crore loans have been disbursed amounting to Rs. 7,23,000 crore. While presenting the Interim Budget 2019-20 in Parliament today, the Union Minister for Finance, Corporate Affairs, Railways and Coal, Shri Piyush Goyal said that India is amongst the most youthful nations in the world. Through Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, over 1 crore youth are being trained to help them earn a livelihood. Youth power has been harnessed through Self-employment Schemes including MUDRA, Start-up India and Stand-up India. With job seekers becoming job creators, India has become the worldâ€™s second largest start-up hub. The Government is proud of the hard work and innovative ideas of our youth.


    Shri Goyal said that in order to take the benefits of Artificial Intelligence and related technologies to the people, a National Programme on 'Artificial Intelligence' has been envisaged by the Government. This would be catalysed by the establishment of the National Centre on Artificial Intelligence as a hub along with Centres of Excellence. Nine priority areas have been identified. A National Artificial Intelligence portal will also be developed soon.
