      Sale of Damaged Foodgrains
      Posted On: 05 FEB 2019 4:48PM by PIB Delhi


    Foodgrains procured for Central Pool and available with the Food Corporation of India (FCI) are generally stored in a scientific manner in covered godowns. However, during peak procurement period, only wheat stocks are sometimes stored in Cover and Plinth (CAP) storage due to logistic constraints. No foodgrain procured for Central Pool are kept in the open by the FCI.


    Damaged foodgrains available with FCI are sold through Tender Sale/Auction to only “Registered Parties” registered with FCI for purchase of damaged foodgrains for the purpose of manufacturing feed stocks.


    State-wise details of damaged/non issuable foodgrains lying in godowns of FCI as on 01.01.2019 is at Annexure-I.


    Steps taken by the Government to ensure safe storage of foodgrains is at Annexure-II.


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri C.R. Chaudhary in Lok Sabha today.

    ANNEXURE-II


    STEPS TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE SAFE STORAGE OF FOODGRAINS


    Before the commencement of Rabi and Kharif Marketing Seasons, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Department of Food & Public Distribution, Govt. of India issues uniform specifications for procurement of foodgrains for the Central Pool. These uniform specifications are circulated to F.C.I. and all State Govts./Agencies with instructions to ensure that foodgrains are procured strictly in accordance with the uniform specifications.


    Further, following steps are taken to prevent damage of foodgrains during storage:


     1. Foodgrains procured by F.C.I. and State Govts/Agencies are stored in covered godowns as well as in CAP (cover and plinth).


     1. All godowns are constructed as per specifications.


     1. Foodgrains are stored by adopting proper scientific code of storage practices


     1. Dunnage materials such as wooden crates, bamboo mats, polythene sheets are used to check migration of moisture from the floor to the foodgrains.


     1. Fumigation covers, nylon ropes, nets and insecticides for control of stored grain insect pests are provided in all the godowns.


     1. Prophylactic (spraying of insecticides) and curative treatments (fumigation) are carried out regularly and timely in godowns for the control of stored grain insect pests.
