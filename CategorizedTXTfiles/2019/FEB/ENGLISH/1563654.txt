    The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for 7 Extra High Voltage (EHV) Sub-stations and 24 Low Tension (LT) Sub-stations today in Itanagar, Arunachal Pradesh. This project is a major step towards meeting the national objectives of affordable 24X7 power to all, especially in the remote locations of Arunachal Pradesh and shall also help in bringing the per capita power consumption of the State closer to national average. The project is being implemented by Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID) a ‘Navratna’ Company under Ministry of Power, Government of India.


    The project will give impetus to the inclusive growth by enhancing the consumers’ access to reliable and affordable grid connected power supply. It will lead to reduction in operation of Diesel Generating Plants in Arunachal Pradesh thus bringing socio-economic and environmental benefits to the people of Arunachal Pradesh. The project will also facilitate in development of small scale/cottage industries/tourism in the region and boost economic growth by enabling supply of quality power.


    Further, this project will give impetus to integration of upcoming Hydro Power Generating Plants in Arunachal Pradesh with the National Grid and will facilitate lying of optical fiber (33 kV) to help extending communication facility to the small towns/villages. It shall boost local economy of the entire state with infusion of about Rs. 6501 crore and also by creating opportunities for long-term support of the new infrastructure.


    The present per capita power consumption of state is 233 kwhr against national average of 1075 kWh. The existing Power Transmission and Distribution system needed a major reconstruction and integration with National Grid to meet the present and future load requirement as well as to fuel faster economic growth.


    The occasion was graced by Brigadier (Dr.) B.D. Mishra (Retd.), Hon’ble Governor, Arunachal Pradesh, Shri Tenzing Norbu Thongdok, Speaker, Arunachal Pradesh, Shri Pema Khandu, Chief Minister, Arunachal Pradesh, Shri Kiren Rijiju, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Chowna Mein, Deputy Chief Minister, Arunachal Pradesh, Shri A. K. Bhalla, Secretary, Power, Government of India, Shri Ravi P. Singh, CMD, POWERGRID, and other senior officials of state government and POWERGRID.
    
    Details of the Project:


    The scheme comprises construction of 24 new 132/33 kV (EHV) Sub-stations with 529 MVA transformation capacity and 70 new 33/11 kV Distribution Sub-stations with 465 MVA transformation capacity apart from laying of 1917 kms of 132 kV Transmission Lines and 1923 kms of 33 kV Lines.
    
    Contracts for construction of 18 Nos. 132/33 kV Sub-stations, 1716 Kms of 132 kV Transmission Lines and 46 Nos. 33/11 kV Sub-stations with associated 33 kV lines of 1202 kms have been awarded. The construction activities in 13 Nos. 132/33 kV Sub-stations, 21 Nos. 33/11 kV Sub-stations and associated lines under the awarded contracts have already been commenced.
    
    It will also augment and improve the present distribution system through 33 kV & 11 kV lines to villages and towns including remote and border areas ensuring strong and reliable transmission & distribution system in the state in coming years (present load is about 138 MW, projected load as per 19 th EPS is 482 MW by 2026-27).


    The Comprehensive Scheme for Strengthening of Transmission & Distribution (T&D) Systems in Arunachal Pradesh was sanctioned on 10th October, 2014 under Central Sector Plan Scheme of Ministry of Power, Govt. of India at an estimated cost of ₹ 3,199.45 Crores (at April, 2013 price level) to be funded by Govt. of India.
