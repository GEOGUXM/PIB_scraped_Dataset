    Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) successfully flight tested the second indigenously developed ‘Solid Fuel Ducted Ramjet (SFDR)’ propulsion based missile system from ITR, Chandipur, Odisha today. Ground booster, separation of ground booster and Nozzle-less-booster performance were found satisfactory. Missile was guided to high altitude to simulate aircraft release conditions and subsequently nozzle-less-booster was ignited. SFDR based missile accelerated to achieve ramjet Mach number successfully. The trajectory was tracked by telemetry and radar stations till touchdown. All the mission objectives have been met.


    The success of SFDR propulsion technology is a significant milestone and will pave the way for development of long range air-to-air missiles in the country.


    Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman congratulated DRDO and associated team members for the stupendous mission.
