    In the absence of any authentic survey, the accurate date of Sikh and Hindu refugees who came from Afghanistan and Pakistan during the last three years is not available.


    As per the data available in online system, 1595 Pakistani and 391 Afghanistani migrants of all religions have been granted Indian Citizenship in last 3 years (2016 to 2018). Provision for capturing online citizenship data of migrants from minority communities namely Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian hailing from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh was introduced in 2018. As per the available data, 295 Hindus and Sikhs from Afghanistan and Pakistan have been granted Indian Citizenship since then.
