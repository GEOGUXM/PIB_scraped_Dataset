      Posted On: 09 FEB 2019 7:01PM by PIB Delhi


    Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the Sela Tunnel Project in Arunachal Pradesh, today. The Project costing Rs. 687 crore being constructed by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) would be completed in the next three years. It covers a total distance of 12.04 kms which consist of two tunnels of 1790 and 475 meters. Once completed this would result in:-

      * ​All weather connectivity to Tawang and forward areas.
      * ​Reduction in more than one hour of travelling time from Tezpur to Tawang.
      * ​Travellers would be able to avoid the dangerous snow covered Sela top at a height of 13,700 feet.​

    All weather connectivity to Tawang would be a game changer for the local population ahead of Sela apart from the much required strategic edge for our security forces.
