      Posted On: 05 FEB 2019 4:42PM by PIB Delhi


    The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) is functioning well as can be seen from the number of cases filed, which, since inception is 126369, out of which 106570 has been disposed. The NCDRC has been safe guarding the interests and rights of the consumers. Complaints where the value of goods or services & compensation claimed is beyond Rs. 1 crore are filed before the NCDRC. It also hears appeals against orders of the State Commissions.


    Details of cases filed in National Commission during the last five years are given below:

    Since the NCDRC is at the apex level , no state-wise break up is available.


    At present, 19799 cases are pending in National Commission.


    There is no such proposal at present.


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri C.R. Chaudhary in Lok Sabha today.
