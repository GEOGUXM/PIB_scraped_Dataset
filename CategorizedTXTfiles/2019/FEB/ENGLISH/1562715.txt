      Posted On: 05 FEB 2019 5:22PM by PIB Delhi


    As per the existing guidelines Long Term Visas (LTVs) are granted to specific categories of nationals of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.


    As per available information, figure of LTVs granted by Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to Pakistan and Bangladesh nationals are available since 2011 and during the years 2011 to 2018, a total of 36610 and 236 LTVs have been granted to Pakistan and Bangladesh nationals respectively. Policy regarding grant of LTV to Afghan nationals has come into effect w.e.f. 17.07.2017 and till date no LTV has been granted in respect of Afghan nationals.


    During these years LTV applications have been processed both in offline and online mode and therefore State-wise data is not centrally available.


    A statement of LTVs granted by MHA to Pakistan and Bangladesh nationals during these years is given below:
