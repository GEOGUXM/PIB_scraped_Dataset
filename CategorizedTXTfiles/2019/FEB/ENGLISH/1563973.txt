    Central Government has not received any complaint from telecom companies regarding seeking of Call Details Records (CDRs). Police and public order are State subjects as per seventh schedule of the Constitution of India and States are responsible for prevention, detection and investigations of such crimes through their law enforcement machinery. State Law Enforcement authorities can take necessary action as per provision of law. Central database of such actions taken by the State Governments is not maintained. Ministry of Home Affairs has issued guidelines in 2016 for seeking Call details records (CDRs) under the statutory provisions contained in Section 92 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 or Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 read with Rule 419A of the Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Rules, 2007.
