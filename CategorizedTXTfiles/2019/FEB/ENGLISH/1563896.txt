      Posted On: 11 FEB 2019 6:19PM by PIB Delhi


    The Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX) framework of the Government envisages setting up and managing independent Defence Innovation Hubs (DIHs). These DIHs will serve as platforms where innovators can get information about needs and feedback from the Services directly and create solutions for Indiaâ€™s major defence platforms. This structure is also geared towards attracting more innovators to work for the defence sector in India.


    The Defence Innovation Organisation set up under iDEX has announced setting up of two DIHs in Tamil Nadu (Coimbatore) and Maharashtra (Nashik).


    The Framework to Fund Defence Innovation Hubs under iDEX, approved by the Board of Defence Innovation Organisation (DIO) prescribes the following minimum criterion for setting up Defence Innovation Hubs:

      * Any Central Government recognized Incubator including but not limited to:
      * Department of Science and Technology (DST) recognized Incubators.
