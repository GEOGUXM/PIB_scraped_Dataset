      Additional Foodgrains to Calamity Affected States
      Posted On: 12 FEB 2019 5:13PM by PIB Delhi


    As per extant norms, in case of natural calamities, the allocation of foodgrains for 3 months of demand can be made to the States/UTs on the basis of the request received so that the relief measures are not affected. However, for the demands beyond 3 months the proposal must be recommended by Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (in case of drought) and Ministry of Home Affairs (in case of natural calamities other than drought & law and order situations). The allocation of foodgrains is made at MSP/ MSP derived rates for wheat and rice respectively. Responsibility for distribution of foodgrains lies with the State Governments/Union Territories concerned.


    The details of allocation of foodgrains made due to natural calamities in States/UTs during the past three years is at annexure.


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri C.R. Chaudhary in Lok Sabha today.
