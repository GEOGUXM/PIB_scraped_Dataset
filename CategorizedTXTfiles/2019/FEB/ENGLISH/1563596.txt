    The Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change, in supersession of Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000, has notified the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The Rules direct the waste generators to segregate the waste at source and hand over the segregated waste to authorised waste pickers or waste collectors. The Rules mandate all resident welfare and market associations, gated communities, institutions, all hotels and restaurants to ensure segregation of waste at source, facilitate collection of segregated waste in separate streams and handover recyclable material to either the authorized waste pickers or the authorized recyclers.


    Further, the Rule prescribes that the bio-degradable waste shall be processed, treated and disposed off through composting or bio-methanation within the premises as far as possible.


    This information was given by Minister Of State for Environment, Forest And Climate Change Dr. Mahesh Sharma in written reply to a Question in Lok Sabha today.
