    With reference to the interim Order of the Apex Court dated 13 th February 2019 in CWP No 109/18 regarding claims of forest rights by forest dwelling tribals and other traditional forest dwellers, several misleading news items are in a section of media. Itâ€™s clarified that Govt of India, Ministry of Tribal Affairs is well aware of its responsibilities of defending the Constitutional validity of the Forest Rights Act and the Ministry will do everything at its disposal to safeguard the interests of the tribals as it has been doing so far. State Governments are being sensitised from time to time for implementation of the various provisions of the FRA in letter and spirit.
