      Posted On: 16 FEB 2019 4:05PM by PIB Delhi


    Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai!


    Governor of Maharashtra Shri Vidyasagar Rao Ji, the popular and successful young Chief Minister of the State Shri Devendra Fadnavis ji, my cabinet colleagues Shri Nitin ji and Shri Hansraj Ahir ji, Minister in the State Government Mr. Madan Yerawarji, other dignitaries present on the stage and my brothers and in particular the sisters who have come here in such large numbers to bless us!


    I salute all the saints like Sarvalal Maharaj and Mukhsa ji Maharaj from the land of Pandharkawda. A few months back some youngsters from the tribal community here had scaled the Mount Everest. I had got the opportunity to meet these young friends in Delhi. I had a positive experience of Yavatmal Chandrapur's zeal after getting to know about their hard work and dreams. I had mentioned about Kolam tribe's initiatives towards sanitation and cleanliness in my 'Mann ki Baat' programme. The way the youth of Chandrapur had cleaned the fort there, was truly an inspiration for cleanliness for the country's youth.


    At that time, I had done 'Chai pe Charcha' and had promised for relentlessly working to remove the problems plaguing the nation. For the past four and a half years, I have been sincerely striving to fulfil my promise. Are you satisfied? Are you satisfied with my work? Are you satisfied with my hard work? I am leaving no stone unturned for keeping the promise that I had made to you. Are you pleased with that? Will you continue to bless me?


    Even today, development projects worth thousands of crores of rupees have either been inaugurated or their foundation stones have been laid in Pandharkawda, in Yavatmal. These projects are related to houses for the poor, roads, railways, employment or self-employment and education.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Amidst all these projects for development, I also know the pain through which we all are passing. I understand your anguish against the terrorist attack in Pulwama. Two brave sons from Maharashtra too have sacrificed their lives in Pulwama while serving the nation. I can very well understand the agony of the families that have lost their sons. Our condolences are with them.


    Brothers and sisters,


    I had said yesterday and I am repeating it - the sacrifice of the Martyrs will not go in vain. The perpetrators of the crime will be brought to justice from wherever they might try to hide. We are not only proud of our soldiers and defence forces but also believe in them. The nation understands the anguish of the soldiers especially the CRPF. Therefore, the security forces have been given a free hand.


    Friends,


    A country that came into existence after the partition of India has become a safe haven for terrorism; a country that is at the brink of bankruptcy today has become synonymous with terrorism. I want to reassure the country to have patience and to have faith in their soldiers. Where, when and how will the perpetrators be punished, who will punish them and what kind of punishment will they be given, everything will be decided by our soldiers.


    Friends,


    Today we are able to fulfil our dreams in a secured way and are able to develop the country only due to the countless sacrifices behind the same. I salute the martyrs of Pulwama once again.


    Our government is fully committed to the prosperity and security of the country. Therefore, we are stressing on the five streams of development - Education for children, income for the youth, medicines for the elderly, irrigation for the farmers and addressing the people's grievances. Today's foundation-stone laying ceremony and inaugural function is in line with the same idea.


    Brothers and sisters,


    The role of connectivity is extremely crucial for the development of any area. Yavatmal's development will also be ensured by its roads and railways. With this spirit, the foundation stone of a road related project worth approximately Rs.500 crores was laid just a short while ago. Besides, Pune-Ajni-Pune Humsafar Express has also been flagged off. This train will pass through Daund, Manmad, Bhusawal and Badnera. This will benefit the people of these areas.


    Friends,


    Besides the road and rail facilities, more than 14500 poor families of Yavatmal have entered their new houses today. I congratulate all those who have received their Pucca houses. Now that they have got robust houses, their dreams to will be robust.


    Friends,


    The central government has set a target to provide home to every homeless by 2022. This government is moving towards its goal at a rapid pace. I want to assure those who have not yet received their houses to have faith that before 2022, you all will have a house to live in. You will definitely have it! So far houses for 1.5 crore poor have been built in villages and cities of the country. In the last four years, about two and a half lakh houses have been built in Maharashtra. The government of Fadnavis ji has also built more than 50 thousand houses. Here, work is under progress for about 12 thousand houses in Yavatmal.


    Friends,


    Houses are being built under the scheme Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. It is helping to build self-confidence of the poor and is also empowering our sisters. Just as sisters are prioritized in our traditions and mothers show direction to the family and the society, similarly houses being provided under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana are registered in the name of the female member of the family.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Yavatmal is among the leading districts of the country in terms of women’s empowerment. There is a very large network of women's savings groups throughout Maharashtra including Yavatmal. Our government has helped the women's savings groups to expand and has given them strength too. These groups have been provided with two-and-a-half times more money than ever before to make them the basis of rural economy.


    Brothers and sisters,


    I remember that the last time when I was here, I had a long conversation with the farming community. Today, as I am once again with you all, I want to inform you that in the recent budget we have announced major schemes for the people of nomadic community like Banjaras along with the farmers, the labourers and the agricultural labourers.


    Friends,


    The Central Government has planned to provide direct financial help to the farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme. Under this scheme, every year Rs.6000 will be deposited by the Government of India into the bank accounts of farmers who have less than five acres of land. About 1 crore 25 lakh farmer families of Maharashtra will directly benefit from this. This amount will be deposited in 3 installments of Rs.2000 each into your bank accounts. And this is not just for one year but for every year.


    Friends,


    This government has also made a major decision for the nomadic communities. There are several families in Yavatmal district that do not live in a particular place due to their lifestyle and other reasons. For the first time in history, government has paid attention to this community. Now the the government has decided to create a Welfare Development Board for these people so that the benefits of development work of the government reach them faster.


    Friends,


    We have formulated a major scheme for crores of people in the informal sector for the first time. Under the Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Mandhan Yojana, those with Rs.15, 000 per month income will receive a regular pension of Rs.3000 after 60 years of age. In order to avail the benefits, a contribution of Rs.100 has to be made per month. The central government will deposit the same amount into the bank accounts of these friends every month.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Our government which is committed to ensure social security has made an increase of about 30% in the budget related to the welfare of the tribal community. This will benefit several districts of Maharashtra including Yavatmal. This decision is a proof of the loyalty and commitment of the BJP government towards the tribal brothers and sisters.


    Friends,


    Massive efforts are being made at every level for the welfare of the tribal community in the field of land, forest produce, education, sports etc. Welfare work for brothers and sisters of the tribal community is being done through various programmes - from Jan Dhan Yojana to Van Dhan Yojana. Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, bank accounts of almost all families have now been opened through which the government is able to provide financial assistance. Now no middleman will loot your money. Similarly, through Van Dhan Yojana, it has been ensured that you receive right price for your forest produce. Van Dhan Kendras are being set up for this purpose. The government is emphasizing upon value addition of forest products and increasing their value. One gets better price for his products with value addition. For example, the price of raw tamarind is lower. However, if it is sold in packets or sold as paste, one gets higher price for tamarind.


    Friends,


    You are also aware of the fact that there has been an increase in the Minimum Support Price of Tamarind thrice during the last four and a half years. In the month of December, the Minimum Support Price of 23 crops has been increased. Moreover, during this period, the number of crops under Minimum Support Price has also been increased by the government. Four and a half years ago, there was the provision of Minimum Support Price for only 10 crops. It has now been extended to about 50 crops.


    Friends,


    Keeping in mind the income of the tribal community, the BJP government has brought about a major change in the law related to Bamboos. Now you can grow bamboo even in your fields and increase your income by selling them. Earlier it was not possible because bamboo was categorized under trees. We have not only facilitated their bamboo farming but are also working towards ensuring that they get a large market for their bamboo.


    Friends,


    Several efforts are being made from education to skill development and employment in tribal areas. We have started a massive campaign of starting Ekalavya Model Schools in tribal areas. Under this scheme, such schools are being set up in the areas with tribal population of more than 20,000. Today a new campus of Ekalavya Model School has been inaugurated here. More than four hundred youngsters will be able to hone their future in this new campus.


    Friends,


    Massive efforts are going on in terms of health of the tribal community. Today three institutions have either been inaugurated or their foundation stones have been laid in Yavatmal today. A disease called Sickle Cell is prevalent in tribal areas of our country and it is serious especially in Vidarbha. For better treatment of this disease and better research, a research centre is being set up in Chandrapur.


    Friends,


    The tribal brothers and sisters are also getting highly benefitted from the central government's Ayushman Bharat Yojana. Under this scheme, free treatment of up to Rs.5 lakh will be provided to the poor in case of serious diseases. Just a short while ago, I met the beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat. The satisfaction on their faces is the remuneration for your Prime Servant.


    Friends,


    The contribution of youngsters from the tribal community is playing a major role in making India a super power in sports. Keeping this in mind, the services and facilities for sports in the tribal areas are being expanded further. The special focus of the government is on the development of sports facilities in more than 150 tribal districts. The government is providing assistance of Rs 5000 crore to each such district by 2022.


    Friends,


    History has been a witness to the fact that tribal heroes have contributed a lot to the development of the country since the country's independence. The BJP government is also working towards honouring this contribution. Memorials are being set up across the country in the memory of the tribal sons and daughters who have sacrificed their lives during the freedom struggle.


    Brothers and sisters,


    You all had elected a strong government four and a half years ago, which is why security of the country, women’s empowerment, welfare of the tribal community and all other development work are taking place so rapidly. Today the government is formulating definite policies with clean intentions and it has been possible because of your every single vote. If you had failed to do so, probably we would have been in the same place. You all will further strengthen this belief of development. I hope you will keep on showering your blessings on this Prime Servant. With this request, once again I congratulate you all for the various development projects. Say aloud with me -


    Bharat Mata ki Jai!


    Bharat Mata ki Jai!


    Bharat Mata ki Jai!


    Thanks a lot!
