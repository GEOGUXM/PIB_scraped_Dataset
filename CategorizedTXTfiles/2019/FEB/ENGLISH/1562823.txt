    The major policy initiatives taken by the Government during the last about four years to enhance production include, finalisation of Hydrocarbon Exploration & Licensing Policy (HELP) and Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP), formulation of Discovered Small Field Policy (DSF), survey of un-appraised area of sedimentary basins, setting up of National Data Repository, policy framework for exploration and exploitation of unconventional hydrocarbons, streamlining of production contracts and fiscal incentives, etc. Under HELP/OALP, 55 Blocks having an acreage area of 59,282 sq. km. have been awarded in Bid Round-I in October, 2018. Under Round-II of this Policy, bids for 14 blocks having an acreage area of 29,233 sq. km. have been launched on 7 th January, 2019. Under Discovered Small Field Policy (DSF) 30 contracts for 43 discovered small fields were signed in March, 2017. In addition, 59 more fields/discoveries have been offered in August, 2018 for bidding in DSF Bid Round-II. These discoveries are estimated to have 189.61 Million Metric Ton (MMT) Oil and Oil equivalent gas in place.During the last three years i.e. from 2015-16 to 2017-18,ONGC has made 24 discoveries and OIL has made 10 discoveries in Nomination and NELP blocks.
