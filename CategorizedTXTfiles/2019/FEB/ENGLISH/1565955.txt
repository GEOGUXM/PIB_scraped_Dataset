    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:

         1. Crude oil production by ONGC during January, 2019 was 1766.98 TMT which is 12.47%lower than the monthly target and3.80%lower when compared with January, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-January, 2018-19 was 17675.14TMT which is 7.51% and 5.41% lower than the cumulative target and production respectively during the corresponding period oflast year.Reasons for shortfall are as under:

      * Loss from WO-16 and B-127 fields in the absence of MOPUs Sagar Samrat and Sagar Laxmi.

      * Electric submersible pump (ESP) problem in wells of NB Prasad (NBP) field.
      * Sub-sea leakage in some well fluid lines of Mumbai High & Neelam Heera Asset, leading to flow restriction.

         1. Crude oil production by OIL during January, 2019 was254.79 TMT which is 23.37%lower than monthly target and 10.73% lower when compared with January, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-January, 2018-19 was 2771.38 TMT which is 10.39% and 2.22% lower than the cumulative target and production respectively during the corresponding period of last year.Reasons for shortfall are as under:


      * Environmental loss (Bandh and miscreant activities)

      * Less than planned contribution from work over well and drilling wells.

         1. Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs in PSC regime during January, 2019 was 825.90 TMT which is 6.07% lower than the monthly target and3.31%lowerthanJanuary, 2018.Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-January, 2018-19 was 8338.73TMT which is 2.68% and 0.63% lower than the cumulative target and production respectively during the corresponding period of last year.Major reasonsin for lower production are;


      * Major deficit in production is from Mangala due to delay in Mangala Processing Terminal (MPT) Upgrade and 45 infills and NE field development drilling campaign delivered less than expected yield (CEIL)

      * Decline in production from Stage-I wells and delay in Stage-II wells in the Aishwarya Barmer Hill (ABH) field (CEIL).
      * Around 65 oil wells are closed due to various reasons like high water cut, require Work-over-Job (WOJ), etc. and 30 Mangala wells are closed due to liquid handling constraint at MPT plant (CEIL).

         1. Natural gas production by ONGC during January, 2019 was 2169.76 MMSCM which is 4.21% lower than the monthly targetbut10.44% higher when compared with January, 2018. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC duringApril-January, 2018-19 was 20586.02MMSCM which is 5.13% lower than the cumulative target but4.95% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year. Some of the reasons for shortfallagainst monthly target are as under:


      * Pressure/ potential decline in GS-4 Gas cap reservoir in Gandhar field.

      * Less off take by consumers/ grid restrictions/ shut downs in Tripura

         1. Natural gas production by OIL during January, 2019 was 222.29 MMSCM which is 10.22% lower than the monthly targetand6.78% lower than January, 2018. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-January, 2018-19 was 2283.08 MMSCM which is 13.38% and 6.26% lower than the cumulative target and production respectively during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall are as under:


      * Loss of potential in Deohal area due to presence of CO 2 in production stream.

      * Environmental loss (Bandh and miscreant activities).

         1. Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during January, 2019 was 449.40 MMSCM which is 25.25% lower than the monthly target and8.65% lower when compared with January, 2018. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-January, 2018-19 was 4622.56MMSCM which is 13.75% lower than the cumulative target and13.29% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * Sohagpur West CBM Block: Performance of CBM wells not as per expectation. Production impacted due to the constraint imposed by IFFCO on CBM. (RIL)

      * RJ-ON/6: Less offtake by buyer and low gas production due to stuck up in two wells. (FEL)
      * Raniganj East CBM Block: Few wells closed for planned maintenance and refrac jobs. Major customer 'Matix' operational shutdown. (ESSAR)

     1. Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)


    Refinery production during January, 2019 was 21944.86TMT which is marginally higher by 0.06% than the target for the month but3.62%lowerwhen compared with January, 2018. Cumulative production during April-January, 2018-19 was 214626.0 TMT which is 0.9% and 1.85% higher than the cumulative target and production respectively during the corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III . Company-wise production for the month of January, 2019 and cumulatively for the period April-January, 2018-19 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

         1. CPSE Refineries’ production during January, 2019 was 13144.64TMT which is 5.91%higher than the monthly target but0.12%lowerwhen compared with January, 2018. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-January, 2018-19 was 126282.0 TMT which is 1.95% and 4.18% higher than the cumulative target and production respectively during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


      * IOCL-Guwahati: Lower due to Crude Distillation Unit(CDU) idling for extended Steam Air Decoking (SAD) shutdown in Delayed Coker Unit.

      * IOCL-Haldia: Lower due to CDU idling for once through Hydrocracker Unit.
      * HPCL-Mumbai: Unplanned shutdown of primary processing unit.

    3.2 Production in JV refineries during January, 2019 was 1679.39TMT which is 6.22% higher than the target for the month and3.96% higherwhen compared with January, 2018. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-January, 2018-19 was 14748.79TMT which is 3.84% and 17.45% higher than the cumulative target and production respectively during the corresponding period of last year.


    3.3 Production in private refineries during January, 2019 was 7120.83TMT which is lowerby 10.31% than the target for the month and10.92% lowerwhen compared with January, 2018. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-January, 2018-19 was 73595.21 TMT which is 1.39% and 4.37% lower than the cumulative target and production respectively during the corresponding period of last year.


      3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of January, 2018 and cumulatively for the period April-January, 2018 vis-à-vis April-January, 2017 are given at Annexures -IV and V respectively.
