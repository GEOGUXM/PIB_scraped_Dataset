    The Scheme of Pre-Matric Scholarship for Tribals is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) which is being implemented through State Govt/UT Administration in a defined fund sharing pattern. As per norms of the scheme, State Govt/UT Administration is required to access the requirement of funds on the basis of number of applications received from eligible ST students and furnish a consolidated proposal to the Ministry of Tribal Affairs along with Utilization Certificate and Statement of Expenditure for release of central assistance as per schematic norms. The Ministry has already released central share of assistance up to 2017-18 to all those States who have furnished required information/documents to the Ministry. Further, 1st installment of central assistance for the year 2018-19 has also been released to 13 States who have furnished required information/documents to the Ministry. The Ministry has also been repeatedly raising this issue of required documents with States/UTs in various review meetings, video conferences etc. so that the eligible beneficiaries may get scholarships in time. Hence, the Ministry is fully committed to meeting requirements of Pre-Matric Scholarship made by various States/UTs.
