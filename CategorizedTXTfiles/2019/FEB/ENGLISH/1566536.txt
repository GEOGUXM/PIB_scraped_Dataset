The 14 Awards were given in 6 categories to recognize achievements in the area of e-Governance, with Gold and Silver Awards in each category. A Special Jury Award is also being presented in Category-I for IRCTC Rail Connect Mobile App.


    Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said that the Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narednra Modi had taken over with the commitment to give "maximum governance, minimum government" and the Government has been able to fulfill this commitment to a greater extent. He said that the Government’s emphasis has been on the digitization in the functioning of various schemes and the award winners have made an effort in this direction. The Minister congratulated the awardees for making these efforts. He said that the regional conferences organised by the DARPG in various parts of the country indicate that the Ministry of Personnel has taken these conferences out of Delhi and moved to different places of country. The DARPG Ministry has held conferences at various places such as Guwahati, Jammu, Nagpur, Chandigarh, Visakhapatnam, Jaipur and Hyderabad, among others.


    The Minister said the Department received about 16 lakh grievances this year compared to about 2 lakh grievances four years ago. This is due to the better and prompt response from the government, he added. He called upon the State governments to follow the best practices developed by the DARPG and activate their grievance cells for prompt response to the citizens. The Minister also expressed satisfaction that now about 99% grievances are being disposed by the Department.
