    The meeting of Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) Cluster Group on Disaster Risk Management (DRM) to strengthen cooperation in disaster response concluded here today.


    The two-day workshop was organised by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in collaboration with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA).


    IORA is an intergovernmental organisation and has many disaster-prone countries among its 22 members and nine dialogue partners. Disaster Response Management (DRM) is one of its priority areas and its Action Plan (2017-2021) has specific goals to improve resilience in IORA countries.


    Participants at the meet drew a draft work plan for DRM in IORA and deliberated on the need for establishing a DRM Core Group to take forward the agreed objectives under the Work Plan.


    Discussions on strengthening cooperation in disaster response interventions, including deployment of response teams and mobilization of relief material to affected countries, were held. Besides, information exchange, sharing of best practices, data and early warning technologies were also discussed.


    A total of 36 delegates from eight Member States, including India, and the IORA Secretariat participated in this meeting. Senior officials of MHA, MEA, NDMA and NDRF were also present.
