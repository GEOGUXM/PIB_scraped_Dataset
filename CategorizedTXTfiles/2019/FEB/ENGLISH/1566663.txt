    4. The Second Advance Estimates of GDP have been released in accordance with the release calendar of National Accounts. The approach for compiling the advance estimates is based on Benchmark-Indicator method. The Sector-wise estimates are obtained by extrapolation of indicators like (i) Index of Industrial Production (IIP) of first 9 months of the financial year,


    (ii) financial performance of Listed Companies in the Private Corporate Sector available upto quarter ending December, 2018 (ii) Second Advance Estimates of Crop Production, (iii) Accounts of Central & State Governments, information on indicators likeDeposits & Credits, Passenger and Freight earnings of Railways, Passengers and Cargo handled by Civil Aviation, Cargo handled at Major Sea Ports, Sales of Commercial Vehicles, etc., available for first 9/10 months of the financial year. With the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 1 st July 2017 and consequent changes in the tax structure, the total Tax Revenue used for GDP compilation include Non-GST Revenue and GST Revenue. For compiling Taxes on Products at Constant Prices, volume extrapolation is done using volume growth of taxed goods and services and aggregated to get the total volume of taxes. Annual forecast of indicators which are available for first 9/10 months is based on regression using seasonal dummies to account for seasonal fluctuations. Some indicators like IIP have been compiled by dividing the cumulative value for the first 9 months of the current financial year by average of ratio of cumulative value of9 months to the annual value of past years.
