    The standards for food grains have been prescribed under sub-regulation 2.4.6 of Food Safety and Standards (Food Product Standards and Food Additives) Regulations, 2011 which have to be complied with by all Food Business Operators (FBOs).


    The implementation and enforcement of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and Rules and Regulations made thereunder primarily lies with State/UT Governments. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has specifically asked State Food Safety Commissioners to ensure compliance of prescribed standards of food grains, inter-alia, by FCI, Food & Supply Departments and Fair Price Shops.


    Regular surveillance, monitoring, inspection and random sampling of food products, including food grains distributed under Public Distribution System, are carried out by the officials of Food Safety Departments of the respective States/UTs and where the food samples are found non-conforming to the prescribed standards, penal action is taken against the defaulting FBOs as per provisions of the Food Safety and Standards (FSS) Act, 2006 and Rules, Regulations made thereunder.


    As per information received from States /UTs, the details of food samples analysed, found non-conforming and action taken during the last three years is given below:

However, draft guidelines titled as ‘Guidelines for making available Wholesome Nutritious, Safe and Hygienic Food to School Children in India’ prepared by an Expert Group /Central Advisory Committee as per the directions of the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi in the matter of WP (C) No. 8568 of 2010 titled ‘Uday Foundation for Congenial defects and Rare Blood Vs UOI & Others’ has been issued by FSSAI wherein the availability of most common High in Fat, Sugar and Salt (HFSS) foods in schools have been restricted/limited.


    FSSAI has been leading ‘The Eat Right India’ movement since July, 2018 to improve public health in India and combat negative nutritional trends to fight lifestyle diseases.


    The strength of ‘The Eat Right Movement’ lies in its holistic and collaborative approach, with stakeholders on both the demand and supply-side joining to make a difference through some clearly identified steps. On the demand side, the Eat Right Movement focuses on empowering citizens to make the right food choices, on the supply side, it nudges food businesses to reformulate their products, provide better nutritional information to consumers and make investments in healthy food as responsible food businesses.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
