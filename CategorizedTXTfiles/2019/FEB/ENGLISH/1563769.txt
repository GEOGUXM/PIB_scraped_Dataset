      Impact of Cheap Imports on Industrial Production
      Posted On: 11 FEB 2019 12:59PM by PIB Delhi


    Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) initiates anti-dumping investigations on the basis of a duly substantiated application filed by the domestic producer with a prima-facie evidence of dumping of goods into the country causing injury to the domestic industry. Such applications are processed as per the procedure and within the time limits specified under the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 and the rules made there under. The proceedings of DGTR are of quasi-judicial nature and adequate opportunity is given to all the interested parties participating in the investigation for making their submissions. DGTR critically analyses the submissions and thereafter recommends the appropriate measures to the Department of Revenue for imposition of anti-dumping duty, if necessary. Acting upon such recommendations of the DGTR, the Department of Revenue may impose the provisional or definitive duties. Anti-dumping measures in force on products of steel and tyres are as under:
