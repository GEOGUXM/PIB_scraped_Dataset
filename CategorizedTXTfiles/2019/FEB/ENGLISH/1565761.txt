    The Digital India Awards under the ambit of National Portal organized by National Informatics Centre (NIC) have emerged over the years as a credible platform to recognize the digital presence and e-Governance efforts of various Government institutions across the country. The awards instituted in 2009 are one of a kind in India for honoring the efforts of different Government entities in the digital realm.


    The Digital India Awards have played a pivotal role in promoting the use of World Wide Web platform as an effective tool for e-Governance. At the same time, numerous departments have been able to take inspiration and emulate the successful innovations which have been recognized and rewarded on the Digital India Awards platform.


    Since its inception the Digital India Awards have seen four editions, beginning from 2010, and biennially being conferred in 2012, 2014, & 2016. Continuing with the tradition of recognizing & rewarding excellence, NIC is all set to organize the fifth edition of Digital India Awards on February 22, 2019, where Hon’ble Minister for Electronics & Information Technology, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad will grace the occasion and give away the awards.


    The Digital India Awards over the years have honored various government departments which have done exemplary work.

In the fifth edition we have the following categories: Emerging Technology, Best Mobile App, Exemplary Online Service, Open Data Champion, Web Ratna – Ministry/Department, Web Ratna – State/UT, Web Ratna – District, Outstanding Digital Initiative by a Local Body.


    In the fifth edition also, various Government entities have been evaluated in the above mentioned categories by a high level jury consisting of senior government officials, academia and industry experts. A new addition to the awards this year is the introduction of a new category known as ‘Emerging Technologies’. This category seeks to identify and reward those digital initiatives that have made exemplary use of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Virtual Reality, BlockChain, Internet of Things (IoT), Voice User Interface, Big Data and Analytics.
