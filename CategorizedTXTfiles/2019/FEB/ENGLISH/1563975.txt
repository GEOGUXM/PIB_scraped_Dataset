    NHRC has been emphasizing upon the State Governments to constitute State Human Rights Commissions and Human Rights Courts for better protection of human rights. Efforts are also being made to sensitize public servants during workshops, seminars and camp sittings. NHRC has also made efforts to strengthen its complaint handling mechanism through promotion of online submission of complaints and utilization of common Service Centers in the country for enhancing the outreach to people.


    Further, Focal Point and Toll Free numbers have been in place to provide required assistance to human rights Defenders and NGOs, civil society members, etc. to get easy access to NHRC in case of alleged violation of human rights.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
