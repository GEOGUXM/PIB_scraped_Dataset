    Under the scheme ‘Assistance for Capacity Building for developing Trauma Care Facilities in Government Hospitals on National Highways’,116 Trauma Care Facilities (TCFs) have been identified and funded in 17 states along the Golden Quadrilateral highway as well as North-South & East-west Corridors during the 11 Five year plan (FYP). During 12 th FYP, under the scheme ‘Capacity Building for developing Trauma Care Facilities in Government Hospitals on National Highways’, 85 TCFs have been identified and approved.


    As per available information, 3% decrease in deaths due to road accidents has been reported from 1,50,785 deaths in 2016 to 1,47,913 in 2017. With establishment of more TCF’s, further reduction in preventable due to road accidents could be achieved.


    State Governments were asked to prepare State Action Plan for establishing more Trauma Care Facilities. Some of the State Governments have identified the locations and included such locations in their State Action Plan.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
