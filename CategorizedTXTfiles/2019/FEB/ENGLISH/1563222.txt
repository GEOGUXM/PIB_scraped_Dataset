      Nuclear Waste Disposal
      Posted On: 07 FEB 2019 3:52PM by PIB Delhi


    The solid wastes generated from nuclear facilities, depending upon their radioactivity content are stored/ disposed of in engineered structures such as stone lined trenches, reinforced concrete trenches and tile holes. These structures are designed on multi-barrier principle for ensuring effective containment of radioactivity. These structures are located within plant/facility premises in access-controlled areas.


    The areas where the waste disposal structures are located are provided with bore-wells in a planned manner. These bore wells are routinely monitored to confirm effective confinement of radioactivity present in the disposed waste. The regular monitoring is done as per the requirements which are in line with the guidelines of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).


    The monitoring of various environmental matrices such as air, water, soil etc., in and around the waste disposal facilities is carried out by independent Environmental Survey Laboratories (ESL) of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) which are stationed at all the nuclear sites.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
