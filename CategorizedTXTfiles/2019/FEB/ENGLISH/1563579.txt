      Posted On: 08 FEB 2019 5:53PM by PIB Delhi


    Union Minister of State in the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation and Minister of State in the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs Vijay Goel responded to a written question in Rajya Sabha today on Unified Model Recruitment Rules for Statistical Cadre.


    Following is the response given by the Minister:


    7 th Central Pay Commission in its report, vide para 7.7.75, inter-alia, recommended that “…. there is a need to streamline the Statistical Cadres existing in various departments under the Central Government under unified Model Recruitment Rules laying down the educational qualifications, job, responsibilities and pay structure of the Statistical Cadre posts. This will ensure uniformity and remove avoidable anomalies in pay structure amongst similar/identical Statistical Cadre posts in various departments. The Commission accordingly recommends that the Government may look into this aspect in its entirety.”


    Subordinate Statistical Service (SSS) is a group ‘B’ Organised Service of statistical officers under the cadre control of this Ministry. As a part of Cadre Review process of SSS, this Ministry has already requested all the Ministries/Departments/Organisations in the Government of India to convey the requirements of statistical function posts for consideration of possible en-cadrement in SSS. Thus, the Government in Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation is looking holistically into the aspect of streamlining the “Statistical Cadre” existing in various departments of the Central Government.
