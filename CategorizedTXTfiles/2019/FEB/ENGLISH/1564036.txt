     1. setting up of grid-connected renewable power plants each of 500KW to 2 MW in the ruralarea;
     2. installation of standalone off-grid solar water pumps to fulfil irrigation needs of farmers not connected to grid;and
     3. solarization of existing grid-connected agriculture pumps to make farmers independent of grid supply and also sell surplus solar power generated to Discom and get extraincome.

    The Scheme is under consideration of the Government and therefore, detailed provisions are yet to be finalized.


    This was informed by Minister of State (I/C) for New and Renewable Energy and Power Shri R. K Singh in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
