    The fortnight long process of auctioning of mementoes received by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his term so far in office, came to a close on Saturday evening.


    The process of auctioning received a tremendous response from the people of India. The process consisted of two parts – a physical auction organized at the National Gallery of Modern Art for two days, and an e-auction through the website pmmementos.gov.in


    Over 1800 mementoes were successfully auctioned to the highest bidder during this period.


    The proceeds from this auction will go towards supporting the noble cause of Namami Gange.


    Some highlights of the auction


    During the auction organized at NGMA, a specially handcrafted wooden bike, received a successful bid of Rs. 5 lakhs. A similar bid was also received for a unique painting, which depicts Prime Minister Modi on a railway platform – a uniquely artistic interpretation of Narendra Modi’s special bond with the railways.


    Some spectacular bids were received during the e-auction as well.

      * A statuette of Lord Shiva, which had a base price of Rs. 5000/-, was auctioned for Rs. 10 lakh, which is 200 times the base price.
      * A wooden replica of the Ashok Stambh, which had a base price of Rs. 4000/- was auctioned for Rs. 13 lakh.
      * A traditional “Horai”, received from Majuli, Assam, (a traditional symbol of the State of Assam - an offering tray with a stand), which had a base price of Rs. 2000/- was auctioned for Rs. 12 lakh.
      * A memento entitled “Divinity” received from SGPC, Amritsar, which had a base price of Rs. 10,000/- was auctioned for Rs. 10.1 lakh.
      * A statuette of Gautam Buddha, which had a base price of Rs. 4000/- was auctioned for Rs. 7 lakh.
      * A traditional brass statue of a lion, received from Shri Sushil Koirala, former Prime Minister of Nepal, was auctioned for Rs. 5.20 lakh.
      * A silver vase (Kalash) with embossing, with a base price of Rs. 10,000/- was auctioned for Rs. 6 lakhs.

    Many other mementoes fetched an auction value that is several times their base price.


    Prime Minister Modi, even as Chief Minister of Gujarat, used to auction mementoes received by him, so that the proceeds could go for the education of girl children. Continuing the same practice, he has now enabled the collection of funds which will help clean up the Holy River Ganga.
