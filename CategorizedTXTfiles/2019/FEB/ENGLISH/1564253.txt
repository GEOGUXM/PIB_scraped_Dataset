      Posted On: 13 FEB 2019 5:08PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government of India is implementing Coastal Security Scheme in all coastal States/UTs including Karnataka, in phases with the objective of strengthening infrastructure of Coastal Police for patrolling and surveillance of coastal areas, particularly shallow waters close to the coast. Phase-I of the Scheme was implemented during 2005-2011 based on the requirements projected by the coastal States/Union Territories.


    Phase-II of the Scheme is underway with effect from 01.04.2011 till 31.03.2020 on the basis of vulnerability/gap analysis carried out by coastal States/Union Territories which projected additional requirements for strengthening the coastal security infrastructure.


    Under the Coastal Security Scheme, coastal States/Union Territories have been sanctioned with 204 coastal police stations, 60 jetties, 429 boats, 284 four-wheelers, 554 two-wheelers, 97 check posts, 58 outposts and 30 barracks.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply to question in the Rajya Sabha today.
