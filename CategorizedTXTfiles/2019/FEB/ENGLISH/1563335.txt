      Posted On: 07 FEB 2019 5:30PM by PIB Delhi


    To promote Inland Water Transport in the country, 111 - including 5 existing and 106 new- National Waterways (NWs) spread over 24 states have been declared under the National Waterways Act, 2016. Feasibility studies have been undertaken by the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) for the 106 new NWs. The Feasibility studies are shared with the concerned State Governments and based on their comments/suggestions and outcome of these reports, a view is taken to prepare Detailed Project Report (DPR) on the development of NWs. As per the Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) completed so far, 30 NWs have been found to be technically viable. Their list is given in Table-1 below Out of these 30 NWs, development activities have been initiated on 10 NWs listed at Table-2 below.
