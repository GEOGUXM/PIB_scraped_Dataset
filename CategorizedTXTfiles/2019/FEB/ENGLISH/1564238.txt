6    2017-18  CTE-type inspection recommended by CVO/OFB in which it was found that Prisms which were procured from trade sources were not tested at the Quality Control Section, rather acceptance was based on feedback from the User Section after function/fitment trials.     Uttarakhand     The CTE-type inspection dt. 19-12-2017 found that the Quality Control Section, which has inadequate set-up, has been accepting the Prisms based on User feedback instead of carrying out mandatory quality checks.
