      Notified List of Tribes in Delhi
      Posted On: 11 FEB 2019 4:00PM by PIB Delhi


    The list of Scheduled Tribes is State/UT specific and a community declared as a Scheduled Tribes in a State need not be so in another State/UT. Where a person migrates from the portion of the State in respect of which his / her community is scheduled to another part of the same State in respect of which his / her community is not scheduled, the person will continue to be deemed to be a member of the Scheduled Tribe, in relation to that State; and where a person migrates from one State to another, he can claim to belong to a Scheduled Tribe only in relation to the State to which he originally belonged and not in respect of the State to which he has migrated.


    There is no notified list of Scheduled Tribes in Delhi. The Government of India on 15.6.1999 (further amended on 25.6.2002) has laid down the modalities for deciding the claims for inclusion in, exclusion from and other modifications in Orders specifying Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes lists. As per the modalities, only those proposals which have been recommended and justified by the concerned State Government / UT Administration and concurred with by Registrar General of India (RGI) and National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) are to be considered and legislation amended.


    This information was given by Shri Sudarshan Bhagat , Minister of State for Tribal Affairs in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
