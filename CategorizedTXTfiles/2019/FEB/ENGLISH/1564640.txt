    Speaking on the occasion, the President congratulated the winners of the School Essay Competition. He noted that almost four million children from over 8,500 schools all over the country wrote an essay concerned with nation building in 13 languages. Among the 78 winners, he said, as many as 53 are girls.


    The President noted that children wrote essays on global warming and what can each one of us do to avert climate change and protect the natural environment. He said that this topic relates to one of the biggest challenges facing humankind. With so many children writing an essay on global warming and climate change, India, he felt, was investing in a generation that cares for the planet and our environment.
