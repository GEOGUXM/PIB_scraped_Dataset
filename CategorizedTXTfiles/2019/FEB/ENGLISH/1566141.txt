      Posted On: 24 FEB 2019 5:00PM by PIB Delhi


    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi will dedicate the National War Memorial to the nation in a solemn ceremonial function tomorrow on February 25th. He will also address ex-servicemen on the occasion.


    The National War Memorial, near India Gate in New Delhi, is a fitting tribute to our soldiers who laid down their lives defending the nation, post-independence.


    The National War Memorial also commemorates the soldiers who participated and made the supreme sacrifice in Peace Keeping Missions, and Counter Insurgency Operations.


    In 2014, Prime Minister had spelt out his vision for the National War Memorial as a state-of-the-art world class monument.


    The layout of the National War Memorial comprises four concentric circles, namely, the ‘Amar Chakra’ or Circle of Immortality, the ‘Veerta Chakra’ or Circle of Bravery, the ‘Tyag Chakra’ or Circle of Sacrifice, and the ‘Rakshak Chakra’ or Circle of Protection.


    The National War Memorial complex includes a central obelisk, an eternal flame, and six bronze murals depicting famous battles fought by Indian Army, Air Force and Navy.


    Busts of the 21 awardees of Param Veer Chakra have been installed at Param Yoddha Sthal which includes three living awardees Sub Maj (Hony Capt) Bana Singh (Retd), Sub Major Yogendra Singh Yadav and Sub Sanjay Kumar.


    National War Memorial represents the culmination of the collective aspiration of a grateful nation to pay a fitting tribute to the martyrs.
