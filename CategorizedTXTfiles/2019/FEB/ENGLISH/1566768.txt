    The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding between India and Norway for undertaking non-intrusive Geological Surveys and Investigations. The MoU was signed on 6 th September 2018.


    Benefits:


    The MoU entails collaboration between the National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd. (NHIDCL) and Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI), Oslo for facilitating a mechanism to work on mutually agreed progressive and supportive activities for further development and improvement of road infrastructure projects in the country, particularly in the North Eastern Regions. The proposal is innovative in terms of extensive geological investigations for introduction of non-intrusive remote sensing techniques like Airborne Electromagnetic (AEM) Survey in conjunction with intrusive technique like Horizontal Directional Coring so as to mitigate the risks associated with geological surprises during construction. It is the most efficient and latest employed technology for geophysical investigation in some major countries of the world in challenging terrain. This non-intrusive method of Geophysical Survey is being used for the first time in India. The technology is provided by very few companies/organizations worldwide, the NGI being one of them.


    The NGI, Oslo has expertise in Geotechnical Investigation and Geophysical Mapping and its being a premier Geotechnical organization primarily engaged in the R&D in Geotechnical Investigations can be of immense help in the construction of mega tunneling projects. It also has expertise in R&D of avalanche protection and slope protection works and other related fields and has knowledge to help save lives and reduce material and environmental damage from natural hazards. The MoU with NGI will enable preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPR) in respect of several on-going projects for construction of strategic tunnels.
