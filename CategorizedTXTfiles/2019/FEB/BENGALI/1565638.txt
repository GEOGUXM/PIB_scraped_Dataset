    Indian Army and the Ministry of Defence have given bulk production clearance (BPC) to Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) on February 18, 2019 to produce 114 numbers of ‘Dhanush”, the first ever indigenous 155mm x 45 calibre artillery gun. The weapon is the first long range artillery gun of India and it is a major success story of the ‘Make in India’ initiative.


    ‘Dhanush’ is equipped with inertial navigation-based sighting system, auto-laying facility, on-board ballistic computation and an advanced day and night direct firing system. The self-propulsion unit allows the gun to negotiate and deploy itself in mountainous terrains with ease.


    The weapon has been mechanically upgraded to fire standard NATO 155 mm ammunition and has the capability to accommodate both boll bags and the bi-modular charge system (BMCS) which results in increasing the range. It has also been electronically upgraded to enhance the firing accuracies, laying speeds of the existing gun and to provide compatibility with various kinds of ammunition as well.


    The ‘Dhanush’ guns travel extensively in towed and self-propelled mode in all terrains-desert and high altitude with each gun clocking over 1600 km.


    The ammunition is the product of joint efforts of OFB and the Indian Army with contributions from DRDO, DGQA, DPSUs like BEL, PSUs like SAIL and several private sector enterprises.
