    DDRS, a central scheme has been operational with the objective of ensuring effective implementation of the Rights to Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (earlier Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995) through creating an enabling environment and encouraging programme implementing agencies through financial assistance. With a view to inclusion of persons with disabilities in the mainstream of society and actualizing their potential, the thrust is now on education and training programmes.

The day-long deliberations with all stakeholders focussed on an in-depth understanding and better implementation of the scheme in terms of better facilities to end beneficiaries, that is, persons with disabilities in the region. About 26 percent of total NGOs under DDRS and 46 percent of Special School for Children with Intellectual Disabilities are from Eastern and North-eastern states.

He said, the number of type of disabilities has been increased from 7 to 21 in the revised Act and that the percentage of reservation for disabled persons has also gone up in government jobs and higher education institutes. Referring to the Cochlear Implant Programme under the scheme, Dr Seth informed, more than 12 lakh implants worth Rs 750 crores has been done. In his presentation, Dr. Seth highlighted the provisions of the revised scheme such as increase in the cost norms by 2.5 times, streamlining the procedure of application, increase in the funding of projects from 75% to 90% of their total cost, extending special benefits to special areas such as Left Wing Extremism affected districts, removal of limit in increase of number of beneficiaries etc.
