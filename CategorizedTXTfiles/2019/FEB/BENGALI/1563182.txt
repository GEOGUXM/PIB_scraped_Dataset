    Kolkata: February 7, 2019.


    A magnificent heritage building that housed the Railway Recruitment Board / Siliguri office has been recently repaired and made reusable by N. F. Railway’s Katihar Division. The approximate cost of restoration work stands at Rs. 10 lakh.


    This heritage structure, built in 1921, was lying abandoned after the closure of RRB office at Siliguri Town station under Katihar division. The vast open area in front of building was also sought by State Govt for setting up of a power substation by taking the land on lease. However, considering the heritage value of the property, repair works have been carried out. The building is planned to be used as RPF barrack / Office. As the Siliguri Town station area has many encroachments and the area is generally highly encroachment-prone the re-occupation of the building will help in avoiding encroachment of building and vacant areas.


    It may be mentioned that Katihar division’s earlier heritage conservation efforts include restorion of the heritage Elysia building at Kurseong which now houses a museum. The Elysia building was the headquarters of the Assam Rail-link Project soon after the partition.
