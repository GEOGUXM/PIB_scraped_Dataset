      Posted On: 08 FEB 2019 7:13PM by PIB Thiruvananthpuram


    Cochin Port dispatched 30 containers today (26 containers having Tiles and 4 containers having Rice) via coastal mode to Beypore port near Kozhikode in north Kerala. The containers were dispatched in the River Sea Vessel (RSV) Great Sea Vembanadu. Shifting of above containers via coastal mode instead of road, was necessitated due to the strike by container trailer operators at Cochin. The RSV has brought 43 empty containers from Beypore to Cochin. In the meantime the strike has been withdrawn by the container trailer operators.
