      Posted On: 12 FEB 2019 3:42PM by PIB Delhi


    Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) is implemented through the State Government/UTs. The State Governments have the flexibility to implement PMJAY either through insurance companies, or directly through trust/society, or in a mixed mode. The payment for treatment is done on pre-defined package rate basis. Keeping in view the State specific requirements, States/UTs have the flexibility to modify these rates within a limited bandwidth.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
