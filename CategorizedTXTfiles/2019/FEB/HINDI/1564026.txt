    The Minister further stated that as per the Standing Finance Committee (SFC) Note on ‘Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP), the three year plan of PMBJP envisages that 1000 PMBJP Kendras will be opened in each year i.e. 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20. The targets for opening PMBJP Kendras during 2017-18 and 2018-19 have already been achieved by the Government.


    Shri Mandaviya said that Government endeavours to cover all States, Union Territories, districts of the country by opening more and more PMBJP Kendras in the country in order to make available quality generic medicines at affordable prices to all. To achieve this objective, applications are invited from Individuals, NGOs, Charitable Institutions/Hospitals, Private Hospitals, Trusts, Societies, Self Help Groups and Government Agencies for opening PMBJP Kendras through online as well as offline mode. Application fee for opening PMBJP Kendras has been waived off so that more and more people can apply under the scheme, the Minister added.
