    The Governor of Maharashtra Shri Bhagat Singh Koshyari today asked the leader of elected members of the second largest party, the Shiv Sena, Shri Eknath Shinde to indicate the willingness and ability of his party to form the government in Maharashtra.


    Elections to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly were held on 21st October and the results were declared on 24th October. However, despite the passage of 15 days, no single party or alliance of parties has come forward to form the government.


    Yesterday, Shri Devendra Fadnavis was called upon to express his willingness and ability to form government. However, today, he has shown unwillingness.


    The Governor has, therefore, asked the leader of elected members of the second largest party, Shiv Sena, Shri Eknath Shinde, to convey its willingness and ability to form the government to him.
