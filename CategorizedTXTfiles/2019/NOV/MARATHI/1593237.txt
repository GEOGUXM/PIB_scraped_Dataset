    In a bid to create an all-inclusive festival, the 50th IFFI edition is screening three films for those with special needs under the ‘Accessible India-Accessible Films’ section.


    This is a joint collaboration between IFFI, Saksham Bharat and UNESCO. The aim is to promote the creation of inclusive spaces for the differently abled through Audio description.


    The section opened with ‘Munna Bhai MBBS’ directed by Rajkumar Hirani. It was launched by Festival Director Chaitanya Prasad, Vice-Chairman of ESG Subash Phaldesai, CEO, ESG Amit Satija and actress Taapsee Pannu. Students from Lokvishwas Prathisthan Visually Impaired School, Ponda and National Association for the Blind attended the section.


    First timer at the festival, actress Taapsee Pannu said that she was surprised to know such films were made. “I’ve not seen films that use audio to explain the scenes; so I wanted to surely see how it’s done,” she said.


    “I don’t like to use the term ‘visually impaired’, in fact, ‘your other senses are stronger than ours. I’m happy such movies can reach out to you,” Ms. Taapsee Pannu added. In future she hoped that her films are converted into audio films as well.


    The movies that will be screened are ‘Lage Raho Munnabhai’, ‘M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story’ and the Konkani film ‘Questao De Confusao’ with additional narration for the visually impaired.
