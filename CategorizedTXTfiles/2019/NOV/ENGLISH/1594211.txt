      Posted On: 29 NOV 2019 3:44PM by PIB Delhi


    There is no such proposal under consideration to set up an expert committee to re-examine the National Policy for Farmers (NPF).


    The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs compiles and disseminates information on suicides in its publication titled ‘Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India’ (ADSI). These Reports on suicides upto 2016 are available on its website.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shri Narendra Singh Tomar in Rajya Sabha today.
