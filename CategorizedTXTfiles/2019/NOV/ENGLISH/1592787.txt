      Irregularities in Fixation of Seniority
      Posted On: 21 NOV 2019 4:04PM by PIB Delhi


    The Department of Personnel & Training (DoP&T), being the nodal Department on policy relating to seniority, has prescribed guidelines on determination of seniority in Central Civil Services and Civil Posts, which are to be followed by the Administrative Ministries/Departments.


    Whenever complaints regarding fixation of seniority are received, these references are forwarded to the respective Cadre Controlling Authorities with whom the details of the cases are available, for taking appropriate action. Details regarding action taken by the Cadre Controlling Authorities on such references are, however, not maintained centrally.


    Wherever clarifications/ interpretation of Rules/Instructions are sought by the Cadre Controlling Authorities, DoP&T renders its advice in respect of such references.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
