      Rabies Vaccination
      Posted On: 29 NOV 2019 12:52PM by PIB Delhi


    Under National Rabies Control programme(NRCP) funds are not provided for procurement of Anti- Rabies vaccine(ARV). Funds under NRCP are only provided for training, surveillance, laboratory strengthening and advocacy etc. However for rabies vaccination all the states/UTs have been communicated to include Anti- Rabies vaccine (ARV) and Anti Rabies serum ( ARS ) under essential drug list and to undertake the procurement of ARV and ARS under National Free Drug service initiative under National Health Mission.


    As there is rabies elimination drive by 2030 globally, there is significant demand of Anti Rabies Vaccine and Serum from the neighboring courtiers like Myanmar, Malaysia and Philippines and these countries are importing vaccine from India.Many states and stakeholders have pointed out that preferential export of ARV by Indian Manufactures at escalated prices to the neighboring countries has resulted in nonresponse and non-participation by the manufactures in domestic tenders.


    Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) was directed to monitor the pharmaceutical firms producing ARV for ensuring regular supply of ARV to the States. DCGI requested all the manufacturers to furnish monthly details of the quantities of ARV manufactured, exported, sold in the domestic market and supplied to the government institutions.


    All the rabies vaccine manufacturers were also requested to ensure that the manufacturing of ARV is carried out with full capacity and first preference may be accorded to meet domestic requirements including Government Institutional supplies in the country.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), ShAshwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
