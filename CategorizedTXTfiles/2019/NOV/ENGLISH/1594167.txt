    Given the fact that due to various administrative reasons, State Governments carve out new districts periodically, need for blood of such districts continues to be catered through licensed blood banks in nearby districts and through blood storage centres set up in First Referral Units at Community Health Centres and select 24 hour Primary Health Centres.


    Public Health being a State subject, setting up of blood banks comes under purview of States. However, Governmentof India supports set up of blood banks under National Health Mission as per proposals received.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), ShAshwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
