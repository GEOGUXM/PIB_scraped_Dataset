    The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has been taking various initiatives on continuous basis to provide less stringent regulations, including measures with respect to filing requirements for small companies, One Person Companies (OPCs) and start-ups. T his was stated by Shri Anurag Thakur, Union Minister of State for Finance & Corporate Affairs, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.


    The changes in this regard are made in the Companies Act, 2013 as well as various Rules and Forms thereunder from time to time. The Companies (Auditorâ€™s Report) Order, 2016 (CARO, 2016) has not been extended to private schools and hospitals built on concession land.


    The Minister further stated that the opinion of the Government regarding inclusion of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) members on the NFRA (National Financial Reporting Authority) Board is that it would not create conflict of interest situation.


    As per the National Financial Reporting Authority (Manner of Appointment and other Terms and Conditions of Service of Chairperson and Members) Rules, 2018, NFRA board has 13 members out of which 3 members represent ICAI as per clause (v), (vi) and (vii) of Rule 4(6). The main functions under section 132(2) and (4) will be performed by the executive body of NFRA and as such, no conflict of interest will be there.
