     4. So far 5.97 Lakh admissions under the scheme.

    Government of Kerala had signed a Memorandum of Understanding to implement AB-PMJAY on 02.11.2018. However, since the State was already implementing the Rastriya Swasthya Bima Yojana, launch of AB-PMJAY was delayed till the end of the policy period under RSBY i.e. 31.03.2019. Thereafter, in line with the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Government of Kerala and Government of India, AB-PMJAY was launched in the State on 01.04.2019.


    Before the launch of AB-PMJAY, Government of Kerala was implementing Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana and state scheme Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme. With the launch of AB-PMJAY – Karunaya Arogya Suraksha Padhathi (KASP), both the pre-existing schemes have been subsumed in it.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
