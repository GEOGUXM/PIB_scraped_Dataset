      Posted On: 27 NOV 2019 6:49PM by PIB Delhi


    In the Union Budget 2019-20, it was estimated that an investment of ₹ 50 lakh crores would be needed for railway infrastructure between 2018-2030. Railway projects are not conceived/executed on State/Union Territory basis.


    Investment in Railways is mobilised from a mix of sources including budgetary and extra budgetary resources through institutional finance and Public Private Partnership (PPP). A part of investment in the area of completion of tracks, rolling stock manufacturing and delivery of passenger/freight services is envisaged through PPP.


    Around 1250 stations have been identified for upgradation under Adarsh Railway Station Development Scheme across all the states.


    Steps taken to utilize various environmental friendly technologies include:

     1. Use of Renewable Energy i.e. Solar Power and Wind Power – At present Indian Railways (IR) utilizes about 202 megawatt (MW) of renewable power.
     2. Provision of energy efficient Light Emitting Diode (LED) lighting - 100% railway stations, service buildings and about 89% of residential quarters have been provided with LED lights.
     3. Provision of Bio-toilets in coaches- Nearly 2,30,000 Bio-toilets have been installed in 64,000 passenger coaches.
     4. Blending Bio-Diesel with High Speed Diesel (HSD) – Blending of 5% Bio-Diesel in HSD for diesel locomotive was started in June, 2015

    Some of the steps taken to reduce losses in Railways include :

     1. Operational efficiencies through running longer and heavier trains.
     2. Formulation of policies for non-fare revenue generation.
     3. Monetization of surplus land through Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA).

    This information was given by the Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
