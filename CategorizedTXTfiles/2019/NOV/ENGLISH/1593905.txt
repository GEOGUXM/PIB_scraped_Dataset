    Policing on Railways being a State subject, prevention of crime, registration of cases, their investigation and maintenance of law & order in Railway premises as well as on running trains are the statutory responsibility of the State Governments, which they discharge through Government Railway Police (GRP)/District Police. Cases of Indian Penal Code (IPC) crimes are registered and investigated by the concerned GRP. Railway Protection Force (RPF) supplements the efforts of GRP by deploying its staff. The number of cases registered on account of destruction of railway property during the years 2016, 2017 & 2018 are 20, 30 and 32 respectively. The States of Haryana, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have witnessed maximum cases of destruction of railway property and disruption of rail services due to law and order situation during the last three years i.e. 2016, 2017 & 2018. However, West Bengal has not provided figures after August 2018.
