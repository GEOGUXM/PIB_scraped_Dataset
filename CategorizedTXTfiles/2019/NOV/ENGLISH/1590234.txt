    Speaking on the occasion, the President said that NEHU has emerged as a premier centre of learning. He was happy to note that besides imparting higher education in all the major disciplines, the university is also giving special emphasis on the development of this region which has significant tribal population. He said that institutions of higher education like NEHU can be instruments of social and economic transformation.

By helping improve agricultural productivity, NEHU can play a catalytic role in promoting socio-economic development of Meghalaya and the North-East. Students and teachers of NEHU’s departments of ‘Rural Development and Agricultural Production’, ‘Agri Business and Food Technology’, and ‘Horticulture’ can help enhance farmers’ income.


    The President told students that they are entering a world full of opportunities and challenges. He said that higher education is a privilege not available to a lot of people in our country. He appealed them to help improve the condition of such underprivileged fellow citizens. He also urged upon them to give back to the society in whatever way they can.
