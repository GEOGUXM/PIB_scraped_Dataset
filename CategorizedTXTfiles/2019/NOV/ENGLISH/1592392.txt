    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, presented the President’s Colour to the Indian Naval Academy at Ezhimala, Kerala today (November 20, 2019).


    Speaking on the occasion, the President said that India is a maritime nation, with a long coastline. We have several islands on either coast, acting as our national outposts, and of utmost strategic value. A significant proportion of our trade and energy needs are met through the medium of the oceans. Safety of the seas and maritime commons, therefore, remains a critical requirement to ensure the economic and infrastructure development on land, as also to ensure well-being of its people.


    The President said that we live in a digital age and the battles of tomorrow will also be fought in the domain of information and technology. Cadets of the Indian Naval Academy, as technical graduates, would be expected to stay ahead of the technology curve to be better prepared to respond when required. He urged them to fully utilise their training at the Academy, to be better leaders in the complex and uncertain world of tomorrow.
