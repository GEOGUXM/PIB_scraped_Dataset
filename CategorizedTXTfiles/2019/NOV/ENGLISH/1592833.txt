Subsequently, seven States reported 19,09,679 un-electrified households which were un-willing earlier but are now willing to get electricity connection. These houses are being electrified by the concerned States. The State/UT-wise details are given at Annexure-I. The State-wise per capita electricity consumption for 2018-19 is given at Annexure-II .


    As reported by the States, 5,251 un-electrified inhabited census villages were electrified under DDUGJY during the last two years i.e. 2017-18 & 2018-19 (up to 28April, 2018). The State-wise details are given at Annexure-III .

    As reported by the States, number of hours of power supply in rural areas, is given at Annexure-V. All the inhabited census villages stand electrified as on 28April, 2018. Electricity is a concurrent subject and as such providing electricity connection to households falls under the purview of State Governments / Power Utility. All the States/UTs have entered into Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of India for providing 24 x 7 power supply to all households, industrial and commercial consumers from April, 2019 and adequate supply of power to agricultural consumers as per State policy. Government of India is supplementing the efforts of the States through its various schemes including Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana- Saubhagya and Ujjwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY).
