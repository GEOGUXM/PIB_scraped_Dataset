    Real-time Train Information System (RTIS) project is being executed by Centre for Railway Information System (CRIS), which is an Information Technology arm of the Ministry of Railways, in collaboration with Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It is primarily used for acquisition of train movement data, including that of arrival, departure, run-through timings at the stations in route. As the RTIS devices have been installed in locomotives, the trains hauled by such locomotives get tracked through this system. The zone-wise details of installation of RTIS device in the passenger and goods train locomotives till 20.11.2019, are as under:

    Additional funds for installation of RTIS system in 6000 more locomotives (both passenger and goods) have been sanctioned in 2019.


    The automatic acquisition of the train running data by the RTIS system helps in improving the efficiency of train control, dissemination of accurate train running information to the passengers and freight customers, and emergency messaging between locomotive and control centre.


    This information was given by the Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
