    The Very Severe Cyclonic Storm ‘Bulbul’ (pronounced as Bul bul) over northwest and adjoining westcentral Bay of Bengal moved nearly northwards with a speed of 13 kmph during past 06 hours, and lay centred at 0530 hrs IST of today, the 9th November 2019, over northwest Bay of Bengal, near Lat.20.0°N and Long. 87.7°E about 110 km east-southeast of Paradip (Odisha), 190 km south-southwest of Sagar Islands (West Bengal) and 340 km south-southwest of Khepupara (Bangladesh). It is very likely to weaken gradually, move northeastwards and cross West Bengal - Bangladesh Coasts between Sagar Islands (West Bengal) and Khepupara (Bangladesh), across Sunderban delta by late evening/night of 9th November as a Severe Cyclonic Storm with maximum sustained wind speed of 110-120 Kmph gusting to 135 Kmph.


    The Very Severe Cyclonic Storm ‘Bulbul’ is being tracked by the Doppler Weather Radars at Gopalpur, Paradip and Kolkata in addition to other observing platforms.
