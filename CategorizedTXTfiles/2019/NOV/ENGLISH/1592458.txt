      Elimination of Unmanned Level Crossings
      Posted On: 20 NOV 2019 5:40PM by PIB Delhi


    All unmanned Level Crossings (LCs) on Broad gauge have been eliminated by January 2019. However, on manned LCs, Road over Bridge (ROB) in lieu of these LCs are being constructed on cost-sharing basis if traffic density is more than one lakh Train Vehicle Unit (TVU) subject to consent of State Government for closure of the LC and sharing of cost.


    State-wise details of Number of Road Over Bridges (ROBs) including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan sanctioned on cost sharing basis as per Pink Book 2019-20 are as under:

    Normally, Railway undertakes construction of ROBs in Railway portion whereas approaches are being constructed by State Government. Generally, there is no problem of construction of ROBs in Railway portion. However, it is difficult to fix the time schedule as construction of ROBs on approaches depends upon many factors such as availability of land, removal of encroachments, fixing the alignment of approaches, allocation of requisite funds etc.


    Level Crossings are not closed unnecessarily. These are closed against road traffic for the safe passage of train or trains or any other Railway operations. These are required to ensure safety of both rail and road users.


    This information was given by the Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
