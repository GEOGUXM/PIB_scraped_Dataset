    The factors responsible for increase in Diabetes are unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity, harmful use of alcohol, over-weight/obesity, tobacco use etc.


    Public health and hospitals is a state subject. The Central government however supplements efforts to the state Governments. Government of India is implementing National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke(NPCDCS) for interventions upto district level under the National Health Mission(NHM). Treatment for diabetes is also available in tertiary level health facilities run by the Central and State Governments.


    A population level initiative of prevention, control and screening for common NCDs (diabetes, hypertension and common cancers viz. oral, breast and cervical cancer) has also been rolled out under NHM, as a part of comprehensive primary healthcare. Under this initiative, frontline health workers such as Accredited Social Health Activists and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives, inter alia, are leveraged to carry out screening and generate awareness about the risk factors of NCDs including diabetes among the masses. The initiative is under implementation in over 215 districts across the country. Screening for common NCDs is also a integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres.


    In collaboration with the Ministry of AYUSH, an initiative to use the knowledge available in AYUSH system of medicines for prevention and control of Non-communicable Diseases is also being implemented in 6 districts on pilot basis.


    The treatment in Government Hospitals is either free or highly subsidized for the poor and needy. Under National Health Mission Free Drugs and Free Diagnostic initiative, essential drugs and diagnostics are provided free of cost in public health facilities.


    Quality generic medicines are being made available at affordable prices to all, under ‘Jan Aushadhi Scheme’, in collaboration with the State Governments. Also, 169 AMRIT (Affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment) stores have been set up in hospitals, where essential life-saving medicines are being provided at a substantial discount vis-à-vis the Maximum Retail Price.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
