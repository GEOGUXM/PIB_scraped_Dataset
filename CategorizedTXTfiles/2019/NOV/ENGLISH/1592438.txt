    Ministry of Railways have planned for redevelopment of railway stations through Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Limited (IRSDC), Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) and other Central Government agencies. All major stations on Indian Railways have been entrusted to these agencies for undertaking the techno-economic feasibility studies. Based on the outcome of the feasibility studies the stations are planned to be taken up for redevelopment, in phases.


    Redevelopment of stations is planned through leveraging commercial development of vacant land and air space in and around railway stations, i.e. station redevelopment projects shall generally be cost neutral to Railways.


    Works for redevelopment of Habibganj (Bhopal) and Gandhinagar stations are in progress. Ministry of Railways is redeveloping Bhubaneshwar Station in cooperation with Govt of Odisha. RLDA has also entered into an MoU with Massouri Dehradun Development Authority (MDDA) for redevelopment of Dehradun Railway Station. Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) has signed an MoU with National Highway Authority of India in April-2019, for redevelopment of Ajni (Nagpur) station as a Multi-modal Hub.


    Station redevelopment program is first of its kind and complex in nature and requires detailed techno-financial feasibility studies and various statutory clearances from local bodies etc.
