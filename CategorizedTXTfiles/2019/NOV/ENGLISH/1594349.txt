    The Army Yachting Node (AYN) is organising the “SAIL INDIA 2019”, a National Senior and Junior Multiclass Regatta from 01 to 07 December at Marine Drive, Mumbai. This Regatta is slated to be the largest sailing event in the country, with an estimated participation of over 300 competitive sailors, 25 officials including four members of International Jury from Poland, Singapore, South Korea and China. Of particular note are competitors, comprising of a sizeable number of young girls and women, which hopefully will be a motivating factor for future aspirants and level out the playing field.


    There are a total of 16 categories of boats in the Junior and Senior Division, and there will be 12 races in each class spread over the championship days. The AYN raised in 2001 as part of the Indian Army’s Mission Olympic Programme has many accolades to its credit including several National champions, Asian Games medals, medals at International Championships and Olympic participation. With the motto of “Excellence Everywhere”, AYN has established a very high benchmark in sailing in the country through sheer hard work and dedication.


    This regatta is being conducted to achieve its intended aim of attracting more youth across all genders and class into this sport and for developing more young talent and technical specialisation for the Army sailing for the future glory of the country. The championship would also go a long way in promoting this ‘clean green’ sport amongst the youth of the country and make this a premier international sailing event in the country in near future.
