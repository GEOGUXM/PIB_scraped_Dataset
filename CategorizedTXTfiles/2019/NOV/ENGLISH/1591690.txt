    Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi along with the Heads of states of other BRICS countries participated in the Leaders dialogue with BRICS Business Council and New Development Bank.


    Prime Minister said that the BRICS Business Council created a roadmap to achieve the $ 500 billion Intra-BRICS trade target by the next summit and identification of economic complementarities among BRICS countries would be important in this effort. The partnership agreement between New Development Bank and BRICS Business Council would be useful for both the institutions, he added.


    PM requested BRICS countries and NDB to join Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure initiative. He also requested that the work of establishing the Regional Office of NDB in India should be completed soon. This will give a boost to projects in priority areas, he added.


    PM concluded that our dream of strengthening BRICS economic cooperation can be realized only with the full cooperation of the Business Council and New Development Bank.
