      India’s Efforts to Combat Global Climate Change
      Posted On: 25 NOV 2019 5:47PM by PIB Delhi


    Reports from various sources including Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change namely Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, Special Report on Climate Change and Land, and Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, highlight the challenges faced due to climate change arising mainly from historical emissions of greenhouse gases by developed countries. A recent report entitled “World Scientists’ Warning of a Climate Emergency” published in journal Bioscience’ ( https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biz088 ) with many authors from a broad range of disciplines informs that the planet clearly and unequivocally faces a climate emergency, and provides six broad policy goals in the area of energy, short-lived climate pollutants, nature conservation and ecosystem restoration, food, sustainable economic growth and population stabilisation that must be met to address it.


    Climate change is a global phenomenon and requires the cooperation of all nations based on the principles of ‘Equity’ and ‘Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities’. India is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), its Kyoto Protocol (KP) and the Paris Agreement (PA). The ambitious Paris Agreement has mechanisms like global stocktake and ratcheting up action every 5 years to address climate change and avoid adverse consequences.


    For addressing the challenge of climate change, India adheres to the paramountcy of the UNFCCC processes. It has proactively contributed to multilateral efforts to combat climate change and continues to do so while undertaking its own independent, enhanced initiatives in climate mitigation and adaptation besides meeting all its commitments under the UNFCCC, its KP and PA. Independent studies rate India’s efforts highly and compliant with the requirements under PA.


    This information was provided by Minister of State, Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Shri Babul Supriyo in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
