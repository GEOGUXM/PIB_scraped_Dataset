      * Making the redressal process more robust and data-driven to reduce the Grievance submission and resolution lifecycle. Technology such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) could be used.
      * Improvise the quality of public grievance disposals for greater satisfaction of citizens.
      * Create predictive models using datasets to smooth the Grievance redressal mechanism.
