      Government encourages use of Bio-Fertilizers over Chemical Fertilizers: Union Agriculture Minister
      Posted On: 19 NOV 2019 6:55PM by PIB Delhi


    Government of India has been encouraging use of bio fertilizers instead of chemical fertilizers through State Governments Including in district Gopalganj of Bihar under various schemes/ programmes, viz: Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER), National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP), National Food Security Mission (NFSM). ICAR under “Network project on soil biodiversity- bio fertilizers” has developed improved and efficient strains of biofertilizers specific to different crops and soil types. ICAR study indicates that biofertilizers can improve crop yields by 10-25% and supplement costly chemical fertilizer (N, P) by nearly 20-25% in most of the cases when used along with the chemical fertilizers. Bihar Agriculture University, Bihar and KVKs including KVK Gopalganj are engaged in study on the impact of usage of bio-fertilizers.


    Steps taken by government for promotion of organic / biofertilisers

      * Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY): Assistance of Rs 50,000 per hectare/ 3 years is given, out of which Rs. 31,000 (62%) is provided to the farmers directly through DBT, for inputs (bio-fertilizers, biopesticides, vermicompost, botanical extracts etc) production/ procurement, post harvest management etc
      * Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER): Farmers are given assistance of Rs25000/ ha/ 3 years for both onfarm & off-farm organic inputs, and seeds/ planting material.
      * National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP): Financial assistance@ 50% subsidy to the tune of Rs. 300/- per ha is being provided for different components including bio-fertilizers, supply of Rhizobium culture/Phosphate Solubilising Bacteria (PSB)/ Zinc Solubilising Bacteria(ZSB)/ Azatobacter/ Mycorrhiza and vermi compost
      * National Food Security Mission (NFSM): Under NFSM, financial assistance is provided for promotion of Bio-Fertilizer (Rhizobium/ PSB) @50% of the cost limited to Rs.300 per ha
      * INM &IPM: Government of India has also been promoting soil test based Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) under Soil Health Card Programme and Integrated Pest management (IPM) practices such as including cultural, mechanical, biological control of pests along with judicious use of pesticides to control excess use of fertilisers and pesticides respectively.

    ICAR Research programmes:

      * One acre Integrated Organic Farming System (IOFS) models: IoFS models suitable for marginal farmers have been established in Kerala, Meghalaya and Tamil Nadu which provides scope to generate more than 80 % of inputs required for organic farming within the farm, thus reducing the cost of production

    All India Network Programme on Organic Farming (AI-NPOF): Under this programme, management package involving reduced application of nutrients through manures with innovative practices are being evaluated at different locations which also includes use of bio fertilizers.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shri Narendra Singh Tomar in Lok Sabha today.
