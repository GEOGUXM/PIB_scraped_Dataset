    The Ministry identified and prioritized the projects, schemes or activities for release of funds under the CRF and EI&ISC schemes in consultation with the State Governments/ Union Territories (UTs) as per the extant policies. The projects not considered for sanction/approval under these schemes during a financial year are not treated as pending.


    With the amendment of CRF Act, 2000 through Finance Act, 2018 and replacing earlier Act with the CRIF Act, 2000, sanction of schemes for the State Roads is no longer a function of the Central Government. However, the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) has initiated consultation with this Ministry for finalization of Criteria for development of State Roads as per the CRIF Act, 2000, amended vide the Finance Act, 2019.


    This information was given by Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Shri Nitin Gadkari in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
