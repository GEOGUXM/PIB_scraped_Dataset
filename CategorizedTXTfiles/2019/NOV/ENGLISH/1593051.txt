    The provisions of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act) applies to all matters concerning “Children in Need of Care and Protection” (CNCP) and “Children in Conflict with Law” (CCL). The children under CCL and CNCP are defined under Section 2(13) and 2(14) respectively of the JJ Act. The primary responsibility of execution of the Act lies with the State/UTs. However, the Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing a centrally sponsored Scheme i.e. ‘Child Protection Services (CPS)’ (erstwhile Integrated Child Protection Scheme) for supporting the children in difficult circumstances. The primary responsibility of implementation of the scheme lies with the State Governments/UT Administrations.

    The JJ Act and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules, 2016 framed thereunder inter-alia specifies the benchmark of services to be delivered to the children. The monitoring mechanism is prescribed under Section 54 of the JJ Act and Rule 41 of the Model Rules, 2016. The Ministry has been urging the State Governments and UT Administrations from time to time to register all the CCIs under the provisions of JJ Act, so as to ensure that CCIs offer optimum services not less than the minimum standard of care and protection prescribed under the Act & Rules. Section 39 of the JJ Act, provides information about process of rehabilitation and social re-integration.


    The Ministry has been perusing all the State Governments and UT Administrations to issue directions for inspection of all CCIs under the supervision of District Magistrates in each district. The Ministry has also issued an advisory to the States and UTs regarding the action to be taken in case of disruption to the life of children in case of any untoward incidence of abuse in any CCI. Under CPS, financial assistance is provided to State Governments/UT Administrations with the objective to create a safe and secure environment for overall development and welfare of children in need of care and protection and children in conflict with law.
