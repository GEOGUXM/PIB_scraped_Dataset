      Head on Generation (HOG) System in Indian Railways
      Posted On: 20 NOV 2019 5:14PM by PIB Delhi


    Indian Railways has adopted an energy-efficient power supply system for coaches called Head On Generation (HOG) system wherein power supply is drawn from Over Head Equipment (OHE) through converters provided in electric locomotive (WAP-7/WAP-5) for coach AC, lighting, fans etc. This system is being provided in End On Generation trains, where power cars equipped with DG sets, are provided at both the ends. The system is considered to provide a cost effective, reliable and energy efficient supply system for coaches. This eliminates use of Diesel Alternator set in power cars which creates noise & air pollution.


    There is huge saving in diesel fuel consumption of power cars with introduction of HOG system in Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches. So far, 500 trains have been converted to HOG system resulting in approx. savings to the tune of ₹1182.22 crore per annum. During 2019-20, it is planned to convert balance (200 trains) End On Generation (EOG) LHB rakes into HOG system. By conversion of such trains, Indian Railways is likely to save approx. ₹470 crore per annum.


    This information was given by the Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
