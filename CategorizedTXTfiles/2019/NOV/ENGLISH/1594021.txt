    As per the information/data uploaded by the different Ministries/Departments/Cadre Controlling Authorities (CCAs) on Probity Portal followed by the rectification requests made by some Ministries/Departments/CCAs, during the period from July, 2014 to October, 2019 (as on 21.11.2019), FR 56(j) has been invoked against a total number of 96 Group ‘A’ officers of different Ministries/Departments.


    The Government has the absolute right to retire Government officials prematurely on the ground of lack of integrity and ineffectiveness, in public interest, under the provisions of Fundamental Rules (FR) 56(j)/(l), Rule 48 of Central Civil Services (CCS) Pension Rules, 1972. These rules lay down the policy of periodic review and premature retirement of Government servants, which is a continuous process.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, DrJitendra Singh in written reply to a question in RajyaSabha today.
