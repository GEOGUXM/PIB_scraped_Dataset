      Posted On: 27 NOV 2019 7:03PM by PIB Delhi


    Ministry of Railways through various agencies is undertaking techno-economic feasibility studies of Railway stations. Based on the outcome of these feasibility studies, stations are planned to be taken up for redevelopment in phases. The cost of station redevelopment project is to be met by leveraging commercial development of land and air space in and around the stations. Presently, work of redevelopment is in progress at Gandhinagar(Gujarat) and Habibganj(Bhopal) stations.


    The facilities proposed in a redeveloped station include congestion free non-conflicting entry/exit to the station premises, segregation of arrival/departure of passengers, adequate concourse without overcrowding, integration of both sides of the city wherever feasible, integration with other modes of transport systems e.g. Bus, Metro, etc., user friendly international signage, well illuminated circulating area and sufficient provision for drop off, pick up & parking etc.


    Various developers have shown interest in redevelopment of stations on Indian Railways. All major railway stations on Indian Railways are planned to be taken up for redevelopment, especially the stations located in major cities, pilgrimage centres and important tourist destination, including Sawai Madhopur station.


    This information was given by the Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
