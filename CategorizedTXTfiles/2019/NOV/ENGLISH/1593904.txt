      Posted On: 27 NOV 2019 7:00PM by PIB Delhi


    Production Programmes for 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 include manufacture of 160, 240 and 240 coaches respectively for train sets at Integral Coach Factory (ICF). Two rakes have already been put into service.


    Train 18 is a Semi High Speed fully air conditioned Train having quicker acceleration and contemporary passenger amenities like on-board infotainment and GPS based passenger information system, CCTV, automatic sliding doors with retractable coach footsteps and zero discharge vacuum based bio-toilets etc.


    Safety oscillation trials have been certified by Research Designs & Standards Organisation (RDSO), and thereafter, based on the certification and own inspection, Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) has cleared the train sets for commercial operation.


    At present, Train 18 trains are being operated on New Delhi-Varanasi and New Delhi- Sri Mata Vaishno Devi Katra sectors.


    Train 18 is a Shatabdi-type train of “Semi High Speed” genre offering additional amenities and operational advantages to the passengers. The fare of these trains has, therefore, been fixed higher than that of Shatabdi Trains.


    This information was given by the Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
