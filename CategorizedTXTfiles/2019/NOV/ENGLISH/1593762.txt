      System to Check Diversion of Domestic LPG Cylinder
      Posted On: 27 NOV 2019 3:33PM by PIB Delhi


    Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) have reported that the distributors are under instructions not to cancel the cash memo without any valid reason. Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS)/Short Message Service (SMS) refill booking system has been introduced by OMCs, wherein the customers get SMS on refill booking/generation of cash memo and refill delivery. In case, cash memo is cancelled by the distributor, the reason for the same is captured in the system and SMS of refill cancellation is also triggered to the consumers. In OMCs software, against cancelled refill, LPG cylinder cannot be delivered to any other person.


    OMCs carry out surprise inspections at distributors premises, conduct refill audits, surprise check at customerâ€™s premises, en-route checking of delivery vehicles etc. to prevent the diversion of domestic LPG. Further, whenever complaints are received, the same are investigated and in all established cases, punitive action is taken as per the extant Marketing Discipline Guidelines (MDG) and the Distributorship Agreement. Whenever complaints/information on commercial establishments using domestic cylinders receive, State Government/District Authorities take necessary action.


    This Information was given by the Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Shri Dharmendra Pradhan in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
