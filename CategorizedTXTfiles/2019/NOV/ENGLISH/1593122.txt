    Government is aware of the prices of food items including vegetables, especially onions and tomatoes.


    All India Daily Average Retail Prices of 22 essential food items including vegetables, onions and tomatoes during the last three years is Annexed. Prices of food items are inter-alia affected by mismatch in demand and supply, shortfall in production owing to adverse weather conditions and seasonality, increased transportation costs, supply chain constraints like lack of storage facilities, artificial shortage created by hoarding and black marketing, etc.

Also appropriate Minimum Support Price are promulgated to incentivize farmers for increasing production. Government is also implementing Schemes which, inter alia, include Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), National Food Security Mission (NFSM), etc. for increasing agricultural production and productivity through appropriate interventions. Besides, Government is also implementing Price Stabilization Fund (PSF) to help moderate the volatility in prices of agri-horticultural commodities like pulses, onion, and potato. Ministry of Food


    Processing Industries (MoFPI) is implementing scheme “Operation Greens” for integrated development of Tomato, Onion and Potato (TOP) value chain which, inter alia, has the objective of price stabilization for producers and consumers through production planning in the TOP clusters and introduction of dual use varieties.
