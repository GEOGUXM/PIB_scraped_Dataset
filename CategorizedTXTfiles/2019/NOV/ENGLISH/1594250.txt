      Posted On: 29 NOV 2019 4:49PM by PIB Delhi


    The Department of Fertilizers has implemented Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) System across all States/UTs w.e.f. March, 2018. Under the DBT system, 100% subsidy on various fertilizer grades is released to the fertilizer companies, on the basis of actual sales made by the retailers to the beneficiaries through Point of Sale (PoS) devices installed at each retailer shop and the beneficiaries are identified through Aadhaar Card, Kishan Credit Card, Voter Identity Card etc. In the present model, Fertilizers are being sold at subsidized rates.


    NITI Aayog has conducted an evaluation study of DBT in Fertilizers, through M/s Microsave and in the report published by M/s Microsave, it has been mentioned 95.5% of the farmers surveyed had individual bank accounts, only 36.4 % of the farmers said that, if given a choice, they would prefer Direct Cash Transfer (DCT) in Fertilizer subsidy.


    The survey by M/s. Microsave is a sample survey, which is not a comprehensive one covering adequate number of potential beneficiaries. DoF is not aware of the Terms of Reference of the study nor the methodology adopted to conduct the survey.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister of Chemicals & Fertilizers, Shri. D.V.Sadananda Gowda in Rajya Sabha today
