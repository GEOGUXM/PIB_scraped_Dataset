      Export of Tobacco to China
      Posted On: 29 NOV 2019 4:21PM by PIB Delhi


    A phyto-sanitary protocol has been signed between the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Government of India and the General Administration Customs of the Peoples Republic of China (GACC) on 21 st January 2019 at Beijing, China. It is expected that signing of the protocol will push overall export of FCV tobacco, primarily produced in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, to China.


    China being the worldâ€™s largest consumer of tobacco, revival of exports to China would greatly help the tobacco farmers in Andhra Pradesh since this could lead to spurt in demand and hence better price realization to the farmers due to competitive pricing.


    India does not have any protocol agreements with any other country to export tobacco.


    This information was given by the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
