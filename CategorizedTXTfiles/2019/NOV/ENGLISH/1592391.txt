    The present Conclave on the theme 'Transforming Audit and Assurance in a Digital World’ is being held to consolidate experience and learning, and chart out the path of Indian Audit and Accounts Department for the next few years. Panel discussions and group discussions are to be held to discuss ways to transform the department into a technology led organisation, given how Government is increasingly being data driven in today's fast changing policy and governance environment.


    The department is automating the audit processes internally by implementing One IA&AD – One System. The department is moving towards minimizing need for visiting auditee units and orienting processes to present interactive accounts and digital audit reports. Efforts are also on to institutionalize knowledge base, leverage IT based platform to curate knowledge resources and develop anytime, anywhere learning and IT based toolkits for auditors. In the last few years the Indian Audit and Accounts Department has moved towards transforming audit to meet challenges in the new age, technology driven India.
