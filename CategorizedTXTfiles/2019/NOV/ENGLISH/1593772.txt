      Posted On: 27 NOV 2019 3:47PM by PIB Delhi


    The second unit of Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP) -2 is operating at about 65% power.


    KKNPP-2 is presently being operated at about 65% power as increased vibration in generator stator is observed at higher power levels. The generator stator is planned to be replaced during the next refueling outage planned from December 2019, following which the unit is expected to be operated at full power.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
