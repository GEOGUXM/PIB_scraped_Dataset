    The aim of Sabka Vishwas (Legacy Dispute Resolution) Scheme, 2019 is to help taxpayers, including small taxpayers, in clearing the baggage of disputes under legacy taxes (Service Tax and Central Excise), which are subsumed in Goods and Service Tax. This was stated by Shri Anurag Thakur, Union Minister of State for Finance & Corporate Affairs, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.


    The main components of the Scheme are dispute resolution and amnesty. The number of applications received from taxpayers, including small taxpayers, and disputes resolved as on 18.11.2019 are as under:

This will help in early disposal of pending cases. The scheme is in force from 1.09.2019 till 31.12.2019.
