    The Guinness World Records for the largest astrophysics lesson (45 minutes) and assembly of spectroscopes was successfully achieved at the Science City, Kolkata on the first day of India International Science Festival (IISF) 2019 today with the participation of over 1,598 students.


    Astronomers use spectroscopes to know details like temperature, chemical composition, etc. of celestial objects hundreds or millions of light years away from us.


    A small personal model of advanced spectroscopes can easily be made by anyone using a box made of cardboard that has a very narrow window used to channel light into the spectroscope.


    A piece of a Compact Disc is used to split the light by a process called diffraction. This attempt is dedicated to Meghnad Saha and C. V. Raman.


    The host city of the 5 th IISF-2019 is home to renowned scientific institutions that have been the workplace of pioneering scientists who gave shape to science in India. IISF is the largest science festival in the world. The theme for this year’s festival is RISEN India –Research, Innovation and Science Empowering the Nation.


    On second day of IISF, the largest electronics lesson and assembly of optical media communication units at a single location will be attempted with the participation of over 1,000 students. Communication link set up through Infrared signals - Wireless infrared communications refers to the use of free-space propagation of light waves in the near infrared band as a transmission medium for communication. This attempt is dedicated to Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman and Satyendra Nath Bose.
