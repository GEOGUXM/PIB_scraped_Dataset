      Employment Data on Ex-Servicemen
      Posted On: 18 NOV 2019 7:09PM by PIB Delhi


    Directorate General of Resettlement (DGR) has been designated as the nodal agency to collect and compile the required data for facilitating monitoring of implementation of reservation policy for Ex-servicemen (ESM). DGR also maintains data on registration of Ex-servicemen for employment and their placement on Half Yearly basis based on data received from Rajya Sainik Boards/ZilaSainik Boards.


    Approx. 32000 to 37000 ex-servicemen are seeking employment through Army Welfare Placement Organisation (AWPO) per year.


    From the data maintained by DGR where it is seen that the representation of ESM in Group ‘C’ and ‘D’ posts in respect of user organisation is not at par with the reservation prescribed, the user organisation is advised to examine the issue of deficiency and take remedial measures to make up such deficiencies. The user organisations are also advised to consider undertaking special drive for recruitment of ESM against direct recruitment vacancy reserved for them.


    This information was given by Raksha Rajya Mantri Shri Shripad Naik in a written reply to ShriPartap Singh Bajwain Rajya Sabha today.
