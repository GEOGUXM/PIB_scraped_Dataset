    During his tenure as the 16th Chief of Naval Staff from 30 December 1998 until his retirement on 29 December 2001, he was the highest-decorated serving officer in the Indian Navy.

He was the Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Southern Naval Command in Kochi before being appointed Chief of the Naval Staff. He participated in the 1961 liberation of Goa and in both the Indo-Pakistan wars of 1965 and 1971. As Director of Naval Operations, he was decorated with an Uttam Yudh Seva Medal for his exceptional contribution to Operation Pawan (Sri Lanka) and Operation Cactus (liberation of the Maldives).


    His demise is a great loss to the Navy and the nation. A funeral with full military honours will be held at Antim Niwas, Sector 94, Noida, at 11 am on 30 November 2019.
