    The closing ceremony of the joint military exercise between Indian and French Army, Exercise 'SHAKTI-2019’ was held at Mahajan Field Firing Range on 13 November 2019. The aim of the exercise was to achieve interoperability, to acquaint each other with operational procedures, combat drills and understand the functioning in such a situation. It was evident that both the armies were able to achieve this aim.


    The exercise was conducted in two phases. The first phase of combat conditioning and tactical training was completed successfully by both the contingents. The training received by both the armies in the first phase was put into practice in the second phase which was termed as validation stage. Both the contingents jointly took part in the validation exercise which included establishment of observation posts, cordon and search operation and house clearing drills including evacuation of causalities using helicopters. The exercise also included newly inducted ‘RUDRA’ helicopter, the weaponised version of the Advanced Light Helicopter 'Dhruv' produced indigenously by India.


    The closing ceremony was organised as a solemn occasion to felicitate outstanding soldiers and to showcase each other’s cultural and martial heritage. Both the armies shared valuable combat experience with respect to countering terrorist operations in an international environment. It was a significant milestone achieved in ensuring cordial relations between the two countries and another step forward towards global war on terror.
