      * The registration for participation will be done by the education institutions through the web-portal.
      * E-training modules, videos, photographs and scripts are available on the portal for online self-learning of the participants.
      * After successful registration, the educational institutions will be able to conduct youth parliament sittings in their respective institutions.
