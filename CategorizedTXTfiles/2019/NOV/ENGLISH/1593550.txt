    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:


         1. Crude oil production by ONGC during October, 2019 was 1712.93 TMT which is 7.22% lower than the target and 2.97% lower when compared with October, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-October, 2019 was 11965.11 TMT which is 3.27% and 3.83% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively.


      * ESP issues in wells of NBP and Ratna R-series fields.

      * Rig deployed at NBP-A well platform and rigs being mobilized for remaining wells.
      * Increase in water cut in certain wells of Mumbai High, Heera, Neelam and B-173A fields.
      * Sub-sea leakage in some well fluid lines of MH Asset leading to flow restriction. Repairing of remaining well fluid lines planned under PRP VI.
      * Production loss due to power Shut Downs & Electrical faults due to thunderstorms/ heavy rains/ water logging in Mehsana and other Western Onshore Assets.
      * Decline in pressure & increase in water-cut in Kesanapalli West field in Rajahmundry and Lakwa field in Assam.

         1. Crude oil production by OIL during October, 2019 was 272.57 TMT which is 5.70% lower than monthly target and 3.69% lower when compared with October, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-October, 2019 was 1886.83 TMT which is 4.91% and 4.16% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Major reasons for lower production is less than planned contribution from workover wells and drilling wells.


         1. Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during October, 2019 was 752.94 TMT which is 7.73% lower than the monthly target and 10.02% lower than October, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-October, 2019 was 5258.52 TMT which is 8.45% and 10.64% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * RJ-ON-90/1-MANGLA (CEIL): Delay in making 45 FM-1/4 infill wells on line. Lag in liquidating the inventory of planned work overs and production optimization jobs. ESP failure in FM-3 well M-357, M-359 and M-387.

      * Operational issues in Bhagyam, Aishwarya and ABH fields. (CEIL)
      * CB-ONN-2005/9 (Mercator): Oil production from Jyoti-1 is stopped. Well closed for long term pressure build up study and could not be put back in production due to non-grant of EC for development campaign.

    Natural Gas

     1. Natural gas production during October, 2019 was 2641.04 MMSCM which is 8.46% lower than the monthly target and 5.60% lower when compared with October, 2018. Cumulative natural gas production during April-October, 2019 was 18646.15 MMSCM which is 6.38% and 2.13% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II . Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of October, 2019 and cumulatively for the period April-October, 2019 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

    Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production


         1. Natural gas production by ONGC during October, 2019 was 1954.35 MMSCM which is 8.84% lower than target and 7.39% lower when compared with October 2018. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC during April-October, 2019 was 14026.05 MMSCM which is 4.72% and 0.72% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively.


      * Less than planned gas production from Bassein & Satellite Asset.

      * Less Gas off-take from Eastern Offshore Asset by M/s GPPC during the month
      * Less production due to less gas off take by OTPC, Tripura.
      * Less production due to less gas off take by gas consumers in Cauvery and Rajahmundry Assets and no gas off-take in Jodhpur & Silchar Assets.

         1. Natural gas production by OIL during October, 2019 was 239.23 MMSCM which is 1.59% higher than the production of corresponding month of last year but lower by 16.98% monthly target. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-October, 2019 was 1623.61 MMSCM which is 1.40% higher than the production during the corresponding period of last year but 18.25% lower than the cumulative target. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * Environmental loss (Bandh and miscreant activities).

      * Less offtake by M/s. BVFCL due to major repeated unscheduled maintenance issue.

         1. Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during October, 2019 was 447.46 MMSCM which is 1.21% lower than monthly target and 0.96% lower than October, 2018. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-October, 2019 was 2996.49 MMSCM which is 6.66% and 9.82% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Mainly production is lower due to less offtake by consumers.


     1. Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)


    Refinery production during October, 2019 was 21925.52 TMT which is 1.34% higher than the target for the month and marginally higher 0.19% when compared with October, 2018. Cumulative production during April-October, 2019 was 147653.63 TMT which is 0.43% and 1.92% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III . Company-wise production for the month of October, 2019 and cumulatively for the period April-October, 2019 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

         1. CPSE Refineries’ production during October, 2019 was 12473.31 TMT which is 1.72% higher than the target for the month but 3.60% lower when compared with October, 2018. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-October, 2019 was 83657.55 TMT which is 0.87% and 4.65% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


      * IOCL, Guwahati: Lower due to HGU interruption.

      * IOCL, Barauni: Lower due to High DHDT feed stock.
      * IOCL, Gujarat: Crude Units idling due to HSD containment.
      * IOCL, Panipat: Lower due to AVU-2 stabilization delay and OHCU extended shutdown.
      * IOCL, Bongaigaon: Lower due to deferment of planned M&I shutdown.
      * IOCL, Paradip: Lower due BS VI test run.
      * CPCL, Manali: Lower due to CDU-1 M&I shutdown.
      * NRL, Numaligarh & MRPL, Mangalore: Lower due to HSD ullage constraint.

    3.2 Production in JV refineries during October, 2019 was 1770.41 TMT which is 11.49% higher when compared with the production of October, 2019 and 52.71% higher than the target for the month. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-October, 2019 was 11410.49 TMT which is 4.04% and 15.51 higher than the target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year.


    3.3 Production in private refineries during October, 2019 was 7681.81 TMT which is 1.32% lower than the target as well as corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-October, 2019 was 52585.59 TMT which is lower by 0.65% each against the target and corresponding period of last year.


    3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of October, 2019 and cumulatively for the period April-October, 2019 vis-à-vis April-October, 2018 are given at Annexures - IV and V respectively.
