    The order book volume of Defence PSUs depends on the customers which is primarily the Armed Forces and export opportunities in the International market. The steps taken to improve the order book position includes modernization of production capacity and infrastructure; emphasis on import substitution and indigenisation; promotion of exports; introduction of new technologies; product diversification; setting up of JVs with foreign companies and preference being given to ‘Buy (Indian – Indigenously Designed, Developed and Manufactured)’ equipment under Capital Acquisition in Defence Procurement Procedure 2016.
