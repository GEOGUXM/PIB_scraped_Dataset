    About IISF 2019


    India International Science Festival (IISF) 2019, an annual event organised jointly by science and technology related Ministries and Departments of the Government of India and Vijnana Bharati (Vibha), is being held in Kolkata this year. This is the fifth edition since its inception in 2015 and will take place during November 5th – 8th, 2019. IISF-2019 is a festival to celebrate the achievements of India’s scientific and technological advancements with students, innovators, craftsmen, farmers, scientists and technocrats from India and abroad. Thus, the theme for this year’s festival is RISEN India – Research, Innovation, and Science Empowering the Nation.


    IISF is perhaps the biggest platform in the country to bring together students, researchers, innovators, artists, and the general public to celebrate India’s achievements in science and technology. IISF is also an attempt to encourage young minds towards the field of science and to promote networking of stakeholders working towards the propagation of science. IISF-2019 expects to host a gathering of approximately 12,000 participants from India and abroad. Biswa Bangla Convention Centre and Science City in Kolkata will be the prime sites for the events at IISF 2019. Satyajit Ray Film & Television Institute, Bose Institute and Indian Institute of Chemical Biology will be sites for a few other events during the festival.


    IISF-2019 will host more than 28 different events during this period. Besides detailed information available on www.scienceindiafest.org, here is a snapshot of some significant events.


    For school students, a Students Science Village has been planned at IISF-2019 where more than 2,500 school students from all over the nation have been invited. Under the Pradhan Mantri Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana, every Member of Parliament has been asked to nominate five students each along with their teacher from their constituency for the village. In six different houses named after our scientists, these students will be engaged in several science-fun activities and interact with scientists and technocrats.


    Young Scientists’ Conference is another big event in terms of variety and number of participants where 1,500 young scientists and researchers will interact with various subject matter experts of international repute and also get a chance to present their posters and papers.


    A vast exhibition of India’s Scientific & Technological prowess will be on display through several expos – most prominent being the Science Expo at Science City. New age Technology show and an expo for the differently abled (Divyangjan) will be yet another one. A book fair has also been planned at BBCC.


    Vigyanika Science Literature Festival will be another highlight of this year’s IISF where several programmes related to the various genre have been organised.


    For media, there’s a two-day S&T media conclave that has been planned too. This shall be organised at the Bose Institute’s new campus in the Salt Lake area.


    The special role of Women Scientists and Entrepreneurs in shaping the scientific growth trajectory will be another highlight of this Festival.
