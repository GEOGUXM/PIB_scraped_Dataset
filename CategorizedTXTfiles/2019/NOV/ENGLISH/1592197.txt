      Posted On: 19 NOV 2019 4:17PM by PIB Delhi


    The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is implementing various schemes for the vulnerable sections of the society. The progress of implementation of the schemes is regularly monitored by the Ministry by seeking physical and financial progress reports along with utilization certificate for the previous grant released, from the concerned State/UTs as well as from the Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). Wherever necessary, review meeting with the concerned State/UTs is also undertaken. Third party evaluation studies are also conducted from time to time.


    The proposals of NGOs for release of grant-in-aid under the Scheme are considered on the basis of recommendations of the State/UTs, satisfactory inspection report of the State/UT and completeness of the proposal in all respects as per the norms and guidelines of the schemes. The Ministry has introduced online processing of proposals of implementing agencies from the financial year 2014-15.


    In addition, officers of the Ministry have been designated as Nodal Officers for various States/Union Territories for monitoring the implementation of various schemes of the Ministry. Performance of the implementing agencies is monitored from time to time through surprise by officers of this Ministry and representatives of Regional Resource Training Centres (RRTCs). On the basis of the inspection report, necessary corrective action is taken.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Rattan Lal Kataria in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
