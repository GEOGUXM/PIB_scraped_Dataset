    Indian Railways has plans to provide 500 MW rooftop solar plants by 2021-22. Most of this work is being done in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode (Developer mode) by private partners, in which Railways do not have to incur capital expenditure. Work of provision of Solar panels on trains is also being done by private partners.
