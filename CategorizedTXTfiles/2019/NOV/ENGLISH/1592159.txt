    Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan ArogyaYojana was launched on 23.09.2018 to provide health cover up to Rs. 5 lakh per family per annum for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation to around 10.74 crore poor and vulnerable families (approx. 50 crore individuals) based on the deprivation and occupational criteria as per the Socio-Economic Caste Census.


    The scheme provides for paperless and cashless access to services for the beneficiary at the point of service i.e. empanelled public and private hospitals across India. To facilitate this, an online transaction management system has been adopted by States/UTs. Further, claims of the hospitals are also settled through online portal in a time-bound manner.
