      Posted On: 14 NOV 2019 8:24PM by PIB Delhi


    “I wholeheartedly welcome the Supreme Court’s categorical dismissal of the review petitions in the Rafale case and with this pronouncement the Government stands vindicated. The SC verdict is also a judgement on our Government’s transparency in decision making.


    “The purchase of Rafale jets was done in a completely transparent manner, keeping in mind the urgency to update and upgrade India’s defence preparedness.


    “The issues pertaining to defence preparedness and national security should never be politicised.


    “The allegations made by certain political parties and their leaders in Rafale jet purchase were extremely unfortunate, unwarranted and laced with malicious intent. The verdict has rightly cautioned such politicians to be careful while making wild allegations.


    “The allegation of corruption in Rafale deal was nothing but an attempt to malign the clean & honest image of Prime MinisterShri Narendra Modi and his Government.


    “The people of India will not forgive the opponents for their slanderous campaign and calumny and they should apologise for misleading the people.”
