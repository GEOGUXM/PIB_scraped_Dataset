    Further, the Spices Board had assisted the State Government of Karnataka in the assessment of the damage caused to the cardamom plantations due to heavy rains in the Coorg district. As per the report, about 1800 hectares of cardamom plantations have been affected with a crop loss of more than 33%. The report has been submitted to the State Government.


    Under the extant provisions of State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), relief in the form of input subsidy for agriculture crops, horticulture crops, annual plantation crops, perennial crops and sericulture is provided when crops loss is 33% and above. For the perennial crops, norms of assistance are Rs. 18,000 per hectare.


    The Coffee Board, Spices Board and Directorate of Arecanut and Spices Development have not constituted any Task Force during the current year to assess the extent of damage due to natural calamity.


    Coffee and Spices need a minimum of 3-4 years for economic yield after planting.


    This information was given by the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
