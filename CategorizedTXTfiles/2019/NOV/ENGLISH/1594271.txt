    Note: Arising and filling up of vacancies is a continuous process. Sanctioned post in all categories are more than the actual operational requirements as they include an element of Leave Reserve and Rest Giver which varies from 30% to 12.5% in safety categories.


    Railway Recruitment Boards (RRBs) and Railway Recruitment Cells (RRCs) are regularly providing panels of successful candidates to Railways. During 2017-18, Two Centralized Employment Notifications (CENs) for 1,27,573 combined vacancies of various Group ‘C’ including Level-1 post (mainly in safety categories) were notified by RRBs. For new and future vacancies likely to arise in two years time, another five CENs covering 1,56, 138 vacancies of various Group ‘C’ including Level-1 post (mainly in safety categories) have been notified in 2018-19.


    This information was given by the Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
