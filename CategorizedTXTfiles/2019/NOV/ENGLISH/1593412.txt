    A meeting of Expenditure Finance Committee under the Ministry of Finance for appraisal and continuation of the “Labour Welfare Scheme” was held on 11.05.2018 under the Chairmanship of Secretary (Expenditure), where it was decided that the Ministry of Labour & employment will explore the possibilities to converge the Housing Scheme with the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojna (PMAY) of the Ministry of Urban Development(Urban) and Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojna (Grameen) of the Ministry of Rural Development. It was suggested by the committee to frame a timeline and to draw a transition plan when all new sanctions under RIHS will be stopped and housing subsidy will be drawn from PMAY. Accordingly all Welfare Commissioners were directed to send all the pending applications to the concerned Blocks/ULBs for sanction under PMAY (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna). No new applications are being accepted under RIHS, 2016 anymore.
