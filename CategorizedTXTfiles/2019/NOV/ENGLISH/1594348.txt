      Posted On: 30 NOV 2019 2:38PM by PIB Delhi


    Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has decided to postpone the date of compulsory implementation of FASTags on National Highway Toll Plazas to 15 th of December, 2019. The scheme was earlier to launched from the 1 st of December, 2019.


    In order to save fuel, time and pollution and to ensure seamless movement of traffic, Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has launched National Electronic Toll Collection program (NETC) which provide for collection of user fee through FASTag based on RFID technology. It was decided that all lanes (except one lane on each side) in Fee Plazas shall be declared as 'FASTag lane of Fee Plaza' by 1st of December 2019.


    Accordingly, NHAI has equipped all Fee Plazas with Electronic Toll Collection System. For ease in availability of FASTag , NHAI has launched MyFASTag APP whereby all information regarding FASTag can be obtained along with location of POSs and charging/ linking with NHAI/other wallets or bank accounts.


    However it has been found that many citizens have still not enabled their vehicles with FASTag due to various reasons. Accordingly to provide some more time to citizens to buy and put FASTag on their vehicles, it has now been decided that charging of double User Fee from vehicles which enter FASTag lane without FASTag will start from 15th of December 2019 instead of 1st of December 2019.


    NHAI FASTag shall continue to be provided free of cost till 15 Dec 2019.
