      Exports of Textile & Apparel Sector
      Posted On: 29 NOV 2019 3:32PM by PIB Delhi


    Indiaâ€™s exports of textile and apparel sector (including handicrafts) have increased from USD 39.3 billion in 2017-18 to USD 40.4 billion in 2018-19.


    India faces competition from countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka which enjoy duty free access to key markets. Apparel exports from competing countries enjoy zero/preferential access to European Union whereas India faces a duty disadvantage. Besides Bangladesh and Vietnam have a large and productive labour force.


    This information was given by the Union Minister of Textiles, Smriti Zubin Irani, in written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
