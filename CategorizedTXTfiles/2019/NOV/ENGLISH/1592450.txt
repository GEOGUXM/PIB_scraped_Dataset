    Modernisation/upgradation of Railway stations in Indian Railways is a continuous and on-going process. This has been undertaken from time to time under various modernization schemes such as Model Station Scheme, Modern Station Scheme and Adarsh Station Scheme. The development of stations under ‘Model Station Scheme’ (June, 1999 to November, 2008) and ‘Modern Station Scheme’ (2006-07 and 2007-08) had since been completed.


    Further, upgradation of stations under Adarsh Station Scheme was started from 2009-10. Selection of Railway stations under this Scheme is based on the identified need for upgradation of amenities. 1253 stations have been identified for development under Adarsh station Scheme out of which 1149 railway stations have been developed so far and the remaining stations are planned to be developed by 2019-20.


    Presently, development of stations under ‘Adarsh’ Station Scheme including upgradation and maintenance of railway stations is undertaken through departmental means and outsourcing. State-wise details of funds allocated/spent are not maintained. The allocation/expenditure on works of modernization including development of stations under ‘Adarsh’ Station Scheme is generally funded under Plan Head – ‘Passenger Amenities’.
