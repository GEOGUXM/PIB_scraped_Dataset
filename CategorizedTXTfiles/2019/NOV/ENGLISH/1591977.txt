      Posted On: 18 NOV 2019 4:22PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government of India on 15.6.1999 (further amended on 25.6.2002), has laid down the modalities for determining the claims for inclusion in, exclusion from and other modifications in the Orders specifying list of Scheduled Tribes. According to these modalities, only those proposals which have been recommended and justified by the concerned State Government/ Union Territory Administration and concurred with by the Registrar General of India (RGI) and the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes are to be considered for amendment of legislation. All actions are taken with respect to proposals of State/UT Governments for the communities demanding Scheduled Tribes status as per the modalities.


    These modalities are being followed for inclusion/exclusion of communities under ST list.


    This information was given by Union Minister of State for Tribal Affairs Smt. Renuka Singh Saruta in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
