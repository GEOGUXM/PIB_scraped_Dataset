      Posted On: 20 NOV 2019 3:17PM by PIB Delhi


    In the current Goods and Services Tax regime, exports are zero rated to ensure that the goods produced in India for exports are not disadvantaged due to the domestic tax burden and stay competitive internationally.


    Further, Under the Foreign Trade Policy, Duty Exemptions Schemes ensure that inputs imported/locally procured for use in the export products are either exempt from duties ab-initio, or the taxes are refunded to the exporters in the form of drawback after exports. Under the current Foreign Trade Policy, there are two duty exemption schemes, namely, Advance Authorization scheme and the Duty Free Import Authorization scheme.


    The details of exemptions for last three years under Advance Authorization Scheme and Duty Free Import Authorization Scheme are as under:
