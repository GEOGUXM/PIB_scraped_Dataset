    The Department of Consumer Affairs through an inter-ministerial committee today again reviewed inter alia, the prices and availability of Onions and Tomatoes. The meeting was attended by representatives of Ministry of Agriculture and Farmersâ€™ Welfare, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Food Processing, NAFED, Mother Dairy, Kendriya Bhandar, Representative of Delhi Government, representative from APMC Azadpur and senior officials of the Department of Consumer Affairs.


    During the meeting, it was informed that there have been some disruptions in the supplies because of Diwali Holidays and rains in some of the growing areas affecting harvesting. This has led to a rise in prices but the increase in arrivals which has begun would have a direct impact on arresting and then reducing the prices in the wholesale as well as the retail market.


    It was also informed by a senior official from the Ministry of Agriculture that harvesting of Kharif Onion is underway in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and has begun in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh (M.P.) and Rajasthan. Late Kharif sowing has been completed in Maharashtra, M.P. and Gujarat. As per reports received so far, area coverage under Kharif is expected to be more than last year.


    In case of Tomatoes it was informed that harvesting is underway in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Karnataka. While arrivals of Tomato has started improving, it has been somewhat affected due to heavy rains in Maharashtra and Karnataka. Arrivals are expected to improve during mid-November with harvesting taking place in Rajasthan, M.P., Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.
