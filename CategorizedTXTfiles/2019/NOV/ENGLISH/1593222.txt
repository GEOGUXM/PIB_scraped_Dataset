    Election Commission of India has appointed Sh Mrinal Kanti Das (IPS 1977 Retd) as Special Police Observer for the ensuing Elections to the State Legislative Assembly of Jharkhand 2019. The Election Commission took the decision in light of the specific challenges of Left Wing Extremism affecting the Law and Order situation in Jharkhand. Sh M K Das will reach Ranchi today to take up his new responsibility and oversee the deployment and other security related issues there.


    It may be recalled that Sh Das retired as Director General of Manipur Police and was also deputed earlier as Special Observer for Tripura and Mizoram during the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections.
