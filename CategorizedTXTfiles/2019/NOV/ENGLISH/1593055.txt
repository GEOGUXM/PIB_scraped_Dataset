    States and UTs are encouraged by the Government of India to develop kitchen gardens at the Anganwadi Centre premises to provide healthy food for children.


    The Anganwadi Services {under Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme} envisages the Anganwadi Workers & Helpers as honorary workers from local community who come forward to render their services, on part time basis, in the area of child care and development. Being honorarium workers, they are paid monthly honoraria as decided by Government from time to time.


    The Government of India has recently enhanced the honorarium of Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) at main-Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) from Rs. 3,000/- to Rs. 4,500/- per month; AWWs at mini-AWCs from Rs. 2,250/- to Rs. 3,500/- per month; Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) from Rs 1,500/- to Rs. 2,250/- per month; and introduced performance linked incentive of Rs. 250/- per month to AWHs, effective from 1 st October, 2018. AWWs are paid Rs. 500/- per month under POSHAN Abhiyaan for using ICDS-CAS. Besides this, many States/UTs are also giving additional honorarium to Anganwadi Workers and Anganwadi Helpers out of their own resources for any additional work assigned to them. Statement indicating additional honorarium paid by States/UTs to AWWs/AWHs is placed at Annexure-I.


    Under the Social Security benefits, Anganwadi Workers (AWWs)/ Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) in the age group of 18-50 years are covered under Pradhan MantriJeevanJyotiBimaYojana (PMJJBY) providing life cover of ₹ 2.00 Lakh, those in the age group of 18-59 years are covered under Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BimaYojana (PMSBY) for accidental cover of ₹ 2.00 Lakh / ₹ 1.00 Lakh and those in the age group of 51-59 years (closed group as on 01.06.2017) are covered with the modified AnganwadiKaryakartiBimaYojana (AKBY) for life cover of ₹ 30,000/-. The AWWs/AWHs are also provided Female Critical Illness benefits of ₹ 20,000/- on diagnosis of identified illness and scholarships to their children studying in 9th to 12th Standard (including ITI courses). These social security benefits to AWWs/AWHs are being provided in association with the LIC.


    AWWs and AWHs are also entitled for Supplementary Nutrition under the Anganwadi Services Scheme. The scale of nutrition is the same as that for Pregnant Women & Lactating Mothers.


    POSHAN Abhiyaan empowers the frontline functionaries i.e. Anganwadi Workers and Lady Supervisors by providing them with smart phones. ICDS-Common Application Software /(ICDS-CAS) have been developed under POSHAN Abhiyaan which enables data capture, ensures assigned service delivery and prompts for interventions wherever required. It enables collection of information on ICDS service delivery interventions and its impact on nutrition outcomes in beneficiaries.


    This data/information is then available on web-based ICDS-CAS dashboard on a near real time basis, for monitoring, to the supervisory staff at Block, District, State and National level for action and decision making at their end. The dashboard displays data and provides reports on various programme areas to the administrative officers to interpret and use the information for improving service delivery. As on 17.11.2019, 5,26,869 Anganwadi Workers are using the ICDS-CAS Application across 36 States/UTs as per details in Annexure-II.
