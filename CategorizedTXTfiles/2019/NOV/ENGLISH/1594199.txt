      Posted On: 29 NOV 2019 3:35PM by PIB Delhi


    Goods and Services Tax (GST) has been introduced by the Government of India to rationalize multiple taxes on goods and services and to bring transparency in the taxation system. Accordingly, it is applicable to the textile sectors also, including handlooms.


    Turnover of most of the weavers does not exceed Rs.40 Lakh and hence they do not require registration under GST. Moreover, GST is implemented through an Act of Parliament with States as equal partners in GST Council with Government of India. GST is applicable on each stage of the value chain i.e. cotton fibre, yarn and fabric at 5% with facilities of input credit.


    This information was given by the Union Minister of Textiles, Smriti Zubin Irani, in written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
