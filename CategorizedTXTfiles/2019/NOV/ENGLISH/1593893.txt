    Policing on Railways being a State subject, prevention of crime, registration of cases, their investigation and maintenance of law & order in Railway premises as well as on running trains are the statutory responsibility of the State Governments, which they discharge through Government Railway Police (GRP)/District Police. However, Railway Protection Force (RPF) supplements the efforts of GRP to provide better protection and security of passenger area and passengers. In addition to the train escort by GRP, lady RPF personnel are also deployed for escorting of trains as Rakshak Dal as per availability to ensure adequate security to female passengers. On an average, 344 women RPF police personnel are deployed as ‘Rakshak Dal’ in 150 running trains for escorting duty on daily basis.
