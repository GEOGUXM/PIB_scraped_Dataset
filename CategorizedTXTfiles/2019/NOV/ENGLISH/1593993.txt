    Section 41 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act) mandates that all institutions, which are meant, either wholly or partially, for housing children in need of care and protection or children in conflict with law, shall, be registered under this Act, within a period of six months from the date of commencement of this Act, regardless of whether they are receiving grants from the Central Government or the State Government.


    Section 42 of JJ Act states that any person or persons in-charge of an institution failing to comply with the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 41 shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to one year or a fine of not less than one lakh rupees or both, provided that every thirty day delay in applying for registration shall be considered as a separate offence. As directed by the Supreme Court of India vide its order dated 5 th May, 2017 in the matter of Writ (Crl.) No. 102 of 2007 Exploitation of Children in Orphanages in State of Tamil Nadu Vs. UOI & Ors., the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) issued advisories to States/UTs to register all Government and Non-Governmental Organization run CCIs under Sub-section (1) of Section (41) of JJ Act by 31 st December, 2017. The Ministry had directed all the States/UTs to initiate steps to close down those Institutions which have declined to register vide letter dated 20 th February, 2018. As on 19.06.2019, there are 7466 institutions registered under the JJ Act as reported by the States/UTs. The primary responsibility of execution of the Act lies with the States/UTs. The number of child care institutions that are registered under the JJ Act in the country as on 19.06.2019 is at Annexure-I .


    The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) has launched the TrackChild web portal in 2012 for tracking missing children. The portal provides a database of “missing” and “found/recovered” children covered under the CPS and the JJ Act, 2015 through a networking and interactive platform of the various stakeholders including Police, Child Welfare Committees (CWCs), Juvenile Justice Boards (JJBs) and Child Care Institutions (CCIs). The portal facilitates matching of the missing children being reported at the Police Stations with those found children residing in the Child Care Institutions (CCIs). The Ministry has been pursuing with the States/UTs Government including police for regularly uploading data of children on TrackChild portal. The details of the progress of mandatory data uploading on Track Child 2.0 portal by Child Care Institutions (CCIs) and State Governments is at Annexure-II .
