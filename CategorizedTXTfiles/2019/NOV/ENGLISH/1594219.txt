    Ministry of Women and Child Development has provided the specifications of Growth Monitoring Devices under POSHAN Abhiyaan which have been prepared with consultation of UNICEF.


    All the procurement under POSHAN Abhiyaan have been mandated through Government e-Market (GeM) by States/UTs. States/UTs directly procure the devices through GeM portal and address the quality issues, if any. However, during the visit of Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development to Dehradun, Uttarakhand in September 2019, supply of inferior quality growth monitoring machines by the vendor in one District was brought to his notice in the review meeting on 30.09.2019.Secretary instructed that poor quality devices should not be accepted and remedial actions should be taken by the State at the earliest to ensure that quality products reach the Anganwadi Workers.


    This information was given by the Minister of Women and Child Development, SmritiZubinIrani, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
