      MRP Provisions for Products Sold Loose
      Posted On: 29 NOV 2019 4:02PM by PIB Delhi


    Under the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 certain declarations are to be made on all pre-packaged commodities in the interest of consumers like name and address of the manufacturer/ packer/ importer, country of origin, name of the commodity, net quantity, month and year of manufacturing, retail sale price in the form of Maximum Retail Price (MRP) Rs….. (inclusive of all taxes) and consumer care details etc.


    Under rule 9 (1)(a) and under rule 9(1) proviso (b) of the said rules provision is already existing so that declarations made are legible.


    Advisory for making some declarations including MRP was issued for loose garments.


    In respect of loose articles the Hon’ble High Court of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in the W P No. 27029 of 2018 directed to the Association of Multiplex Cinema Operators in India formed under the aegis of FICCI to display prominently at the points of sale of the non- packaged commodities, on the menu board, the price per standard unit of weights or measures or numerals or multiples thereof.


    The direction of the Hon’ble High Court was circulated to the Controller of Legal Metrology of all States/ UTs for compliance.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri. Danve Raosaheb Dadarao in Rajya Sabha today.
