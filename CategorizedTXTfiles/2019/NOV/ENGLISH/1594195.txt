    Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing its flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) through National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), a Public Private Partnership organization. NSDC has facilitated creation of Sector Skill Councils (SSCs) which are industry led bodies to ensure addressing skill requirements of various sectors.


    There are a total of 39 functional SSCs including the Skill Council for Persons with Disability (SCPwD). There are total 53 Job Roles with 10 for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) under PMKVY Scheme and 17 Job Roles with 8 disabilities for PwD candidates under non-PMKVY Scheme to cater to the skilling needs of PwD candidates. To Create and ascertain employers demand, SCPwD conducted country wise employers orientation & sensitization workshops during last year. A number of employers have come forward and started employing PwD candidates in Hospitality, IT, E-commerce, Apparel & Textile sectors etc. Employers have also signed Memorandum of Understanding with SCPwD for opportunities on placements, apprenticeship, sharing of job availability etc. MSDE does not maintain any database of the number of jobs and employers available in the market who are willing to hire PwDs.


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri R.K. Singh in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
