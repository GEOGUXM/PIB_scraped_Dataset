      Production of CNG from Stubble
      Posted On: 27 NOV 2019 3:32PM by PIB Delhi


    Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG) can be produced from biomass and organic waste sources like paddy straw & farm stubble, agricultural residue, cattle dung, sugarcane press mud, distillery spent wash, municipal solid waste, sewage treatment plant waste, forest residue etc.


    Government of India has launched Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) initiative on 1.10.2018 to promote CBG as an alternative, green transport fuel for efficient management of biomass and organic waste. As part of the SATAT scheme, Indian Oil Corporation Limited, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited, Gail (India) Limited and Indraprastha Gas Limited had launched an Expression of Interest (EoI) for procurement of CBG from the entrepreneurs at an assured price. The CBG shall be sold to automobiles as clean fuel in a similar way to CNG and can also be sold to domestic, industrial and commercial consumers which are using LPG and other fuels. SATAT initiative has the potential of addressing environmental problems arising from stubble burning. The viability is based on techno commercial factors.


    This Information was given by the Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Shri Dharmendra Pradhan in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
