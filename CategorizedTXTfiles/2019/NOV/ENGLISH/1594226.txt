      Posted On: 29 NOV 2019 4:02PM by PIB Delhi


    The Anganwadi Services has an in-built monitoring system since its inception to track the physical progress of the scheme in respect of various input process, output and impact indicators through a standardized Management Information System (MIS) through regular reports on monthly, quarterly and half yearly basis.


    To strengthen the monitoring of Anganwadi Services Scheme revised MIS known as ICDS-Rapid Reporting System (RRS) has also been introduced for capturing the data of Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) online. Under the ICDS-RRS each AWC is assigned a 11digit unique code and login password is allotted at the supervisor level to submit the monthly progress report. As on date, out of 13,77,595 operational AWCs 13,70,927 AWCs have been assigned the 11digit unique code. State-wise details of AWCs assigned 11digit unique code is at Annexure-I .


    In addition, the digitization of physical registers has been taken up with roll-out of ICDS-Common Application Software (ICDS-CAS) under POSHAN Abhiyaan of Ministry of Women and Child Development. The ICDS-CAS mobile based software enables identification of underweight children based on auto-plotting of Growth Charts. The drill-down dashboard available at national, state, district, block level contributes towards identifying and addressing the problem of nutrition. As on 25 th November, 2019 more than 5,43,863 Anganwadi Workers are using ICDS-CAS Application across 27 States/UTs. The State-wise details is at Annexure -II.


    The mechanism to implement the project in States /UTs include regular review through video conference, meetings and visit by officers to the States/UTs.


    Under the Anganwadi Services Scheme,children (3-6 years) are provided non-formal Pre-School Education service.Funds at Rs. 5,000/- per AWC per annum is provided to States/UTs for imparting non-formal pre-school education to the children in all AWCs. Training is imparted to Anganwadi Workers so that they can improve the literacy and numeracy skills of children of their respective AWC.
