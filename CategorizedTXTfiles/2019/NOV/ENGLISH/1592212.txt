      Decline in Auto Sales
      Posted On: 19 NOV 2019 4:47PM by PIB Delhi


    There is cyclical slowdown across sectors including automotive sector since last few months. But the festival demand has shown YoY growth at 0.3% in the Passenger Vehicle Segment.


    There are various financial and regulatory causes together with perceptional reasons for the slump in automobile sales:

      * Reduction in finance availability to Auto Sector
      * Increase in Axel Load limit for commercial vehicles by up to 25% expanded freight capacity leading to shrinkage of new vehicle demand
      * Increase in vehicle cost due to Supreme Court order for upfront collection of long-term 3 rd party insurance premium for 3 years (new cars) and 5 years (new two-wheelers)
      * Increase in collateral for dealers from 25% to 60% resulted in reduction in inventory finance to dealers
      * Postponement of purchase in anticipation of discounts by Original equipment manufacturer (OEMs) for clearing of stock with BS IV norms (situation similar to the transition from BS III to BS IV)

    The Government, as a policy maker, always attempts to keep and improve momentum of the economy through a package of measures for comprehensive and continued development of the auto sector as and when required. Some of the steps taken by the Government to counter the slowdown in the automotive sector:

      * Reduction in Corporate Tax to22%
      * Continuation of registration of ICE and EV in future
      * Scrappage policy under consideration
      * Proposed increase in registration of new cars deferred till June 2020
      * Funds worth Rs. 70,000 crores released to PSU banks
      * Linking of repo rate to interest charged for vehicle purchased

    This information was given by the Minister of Heavy Industries & Public Enterprises, Prakash Javadekar , in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
