    To enable an area based development approach for Scheduled Caste persons, the Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana (PMAGY) is being implemented since 2009-10 with the aim of integrated development of villages having population of Scheduled Castes person is more than 50%. The vision of the Scheme is to develop the village into an ‘Adarsh Gram’ wherein people have access to various basic services so that the minimum needs of all the sections of the society are fully met and disparities are reduced to minimum.


    In October, 2018, the Scheme was extensively revised to bring focus on important and critical monitorable socio-economic indicators under 10 domains namely, Drinking Water & Sanitation, Education, Health & Nutrition, Social Security, Rural Road and housing, Electricity and clean fuel, Agricultural practices etc., Financial inclusion, Digitization, Livelihood and Skill Development.


    An amount of Rs.1282.22 cr. as Central Assistance has been provided by the Union Government so far to the State/UT Governments under the Scheme.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Rattan Lal Kataria in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
