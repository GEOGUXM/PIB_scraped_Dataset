    The National Policy on Older Persons had been announced in 1999 for the welfare of elderly people. Keeping in view the emerging trends in demographic, socio-economic, technological and other relevant fields in the country, the Ministry is drawing a National Policy for Senior Citizens, incorporating issues such as financial & food security, healthcare & nutrition, safety & security, housing, welfare etc.


    Whereas, Rashtriya Vayoshri Yojanaâ€™ (RVY) is a Scheme of this Ministry, launched in 2017, under which aids and assisted living devices are provided free of cost to senior citizens who are suffering from age related infirmities/disabilities and belong to BPL category, to restore near normalcy in their bodily functions.


    Consultation/comments on the draft Policy have been obtained from the concerned stakeholders such as Central Ministries/Departments/State Governments/UT Administrations/Members of the Civil Societies etc.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Rattan Lal Kataria in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
