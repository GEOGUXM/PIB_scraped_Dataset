      Act East Policy and Rail Connectivity
      Posted On: 22 NOV 2019 5:35PM by PIB Delhi


    At present, India is having transport connectivity with its neighbouring countries by rail/road/air/water routes as the case may be for a particular country. Improved rail connectivity is likely to further boost the trade & relationship.


    Railway Projects taken up between India and Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Myanmar are:


      * Nepal: There are two rail connectivity projects namely Jogbani (India) to Biratnagar (Nepal) and Jayanagar (India) to Bardibas (Nepal), besides the existing link of Raxaul (India) - Birganj (Nepal).

      * Bangladesh: There are two rail connectivity projects between Agartala (India) to Akhuara (Bangladesh), Haldibari (India) to Chilhati (Bangladesh) besides the existing four links, Gede (India)-Darshana(Bangladesh), Petrapole (India)-Benapole (Bangladesh) and Singhabad (India) -Rohanpur (Bangladesh) and Radhikapur (India) - Birol (Bangladesh).

    · Bhutan: No rail connectivity project is under construction.


    · Myanmar: No rail connectivity project is under construction.


    The execution of rail connectivity projects with neighbouring countries depends on various factors such as land acquisition and forest clearance etc. in India. It also entails a large number of works to be done in the associated neighbouring countries. Hence, no precise time-frame for completion of projects can be indicated.


    This information was given by the Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
