    Government of India had introduced Textile Workers Rehabilitation Fund Scheme (TWRFS) with effect from 15.09.1986 to provide relief to the workers, who are rendered jobless due to permanent closure of Non-SSI Textile Mills in private sector, which are eligible as per the guidelines under the Scheme.


    TWRFS has been merged with the Rajiv Gandhi Shramik Kalyan Yojana (RGSKY) of Ministry of Labour and Employment and discontinued w.e.f 01.04.2017. Workers rendered jobless can avail benefits under the above scheme, subject to eligibility.


    This information was given by the Union Minister of Textiles, Smriti Zubin Irani, in written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
