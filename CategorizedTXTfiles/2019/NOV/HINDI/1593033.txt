    Under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) skilling is being imparted through Short Term Training (STT) courses and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). STT is being imparted to either school/college dropouts or unemployed youth at accredited and affiliated Training Centres (TCs). Upon successful completion of their assessment, candidates are being offered / provided with placement assistance by Training Providers (TPs). Under RPL, individuals with prior learning experience or skills are being assessed and certified. It aims to align the competencies of the unregulated workforce of the country to the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF). Directorate of Indian Army Veterans (DIAV) is the implementing body who is providing placement in support with Army Welfare Placement Organisation (AWPO).
