    Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh today paid floral tributes to former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri at his statue at Shastri street in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Shastri Ji breathed his last in Tashkent on January 11, 1966 a day after the Tashkent Agreement was signed between India and Pakistan post 1965 War.


    In a series of tweets, Raksha Mantri said, Lal Bahadur Shastri led India in difficult times and infused new energy into the country through his strong will and determination. “Through his slogan ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’, Shastri Ji united the nation in the time of war and strengthened the feeling of self-esteem, honour and respect among the people of the country,” he added.


    Shri Rajnath Singh described Shastri Ji as an epitome of simplicity and honesty who professed probity in public life. Raksha Mantri also visited the school built in the memory of Shastri Ji and interacted with the children studying there. He expressed happiness on noticing their love for India and Hindi language.


    Raksha Mantri is on an official visit to Uzbekistan to attend a key meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and participate in bilateral engagements with the Uzbekistan government.


    Shri Rajnath Singh will represent India in the meeting of Council of Heads of Government (CHG) of SCO on November 2, 2019. He will also have bilateral engagements on November 2-3, 2019. Raksha Mantri will hold a meeting with Major General Kurbanov Bakhodir Nizamovich, Minister of Defence of Uzbekistan to discuss issues of bilateral defence cooperation.
