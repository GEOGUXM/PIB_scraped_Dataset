      Ayushman Bhart-PMJAY Cards
      Posted On: 29 NOV 2019 12:46PM by PIB Delhi


    The Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) is an entitlement-based scheme and there is no requirement of registration or enrolment of beneficiaries. Accordingly, no scheme specific card is required to avail the benefits under the scheme.


    However, in order to create awareness and facilitate availing of benefits, after verifying the identity of beneficiaries under the scheme, e-cards have been issued to the beneficiaries.


    A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed with Common Service Center (CSC) e-Governance Services India Limited, under Digital India Initiative of Government of India, for utilizing their network of CSCs to verify AB-PMJAY beneficiariesâ€™ identity under the scheme for issuance of e-card.


    Besides, beneficiary identification process is undertaken at all the empanelled hospitals including private service providers through Pradhan Mantri Arogya Mitras (PMAMs).


    Further, Open Beneficiary Identification System policy has been launched whereby States can deploy/engage services of different public or private entities to facilitate the beneficiary identification process.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
