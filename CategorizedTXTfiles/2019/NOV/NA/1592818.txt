    POSHAN Abhiyaan empowers the frontline functionaries like Anganwadi Workers and Lady Supervisors by providing them with smart phones. ICDS-Common Application Software have been developed under POSHAN Abhiyaan which enables data capture, ensures assigned service delivery and prompts for interventions wherever required.


    This data/information is then made available on web-based ICDS-CAS dashboard on a near real time basis, for monitoring, to the supervisory staff at Block, District, State and National level, for action and decision making at their end. The dashboard displays data and provides reports on variousprogramme areas to the administrative officers to interpret and use the information for improving service delivery. As on 31.10.2019, a total number of 5.10 lakh Anganwadi Workers have been trained and are using the ICDS-CAS Application across 26 States/UTs as per details is given below:
