    The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu in his message on the eve of Milad-un-Nabi has said: -


    "I convey my warm greetings and best wishes to the people of our country on the auspicious occasion of Milad-un-Nabi, celebrated to commemorate the birth of Prophet Mohammad.


    The day is celebrated with the offering of prayers by thousands in mosques. Homes and places of worship are decorated with lights and people partake in feasts which are shared with the poor and the needy.


    Prophet Mohammad preached love, peace, compassion, universal brotherhood and empathy. He showed humanity the path of righteousness and virtue.


    I hope that this celebration of the life of the Prophet will strengthen the spirit of generosity and charity and bring people closer to one another.


    May His eternal message continue to guide us in building a peaceful and harmonious society."
