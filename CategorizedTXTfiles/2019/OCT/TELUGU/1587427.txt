      GSI IS NOT INVOLVED IN EXPLORATION OF URANIUM
      Posted On: 07 OCT 2019 6:25PM by PIB Hyderabad


    This is to draw public awareness that Geological Survey of India (GSI) is engaged with 25 geological investigations during 2019-20 in different districts of the Telangana State including Nalgonda District. Multifarious geoscientific investigations including geological and geochemical mapping for characterizing geo-environmental/ geogenic aspects of soil/ water to map deleterious contamination of fluoride, arsenic, heavy metals, if any, causing health hazard etc. and also precursory study of the data for follow up mineral prospecting have been taken up. Geochemical maps of GSI will be of immense societal help in curbing elemental deficiency/excess in soil with application in land use, agriculture, forest and environmental science. GSI is also engaged in exploration of mineral commodities/ ores for economic growth of the State other than any atomic minerals.


    It may please be noted that GSI is never engaged in the search for Uranium or any other atomic minerals any where in India including Telangana. GSI officers will carry out fieldwork for mapping and collection of soil and rock samples during September 2019 to March 2020. Eleven field projects have been taken up in Nalgonda District including one medical geology investigation with special reference to Fluoride contamination in ground water. No project of GSI is linked with Uranium or any other atomic minerals.


    Earnest cooperation, support and assistance from public and local administration is sincerely solicited for the execution of the work by GSI officers to contribute meaningfully in the economic as well as societal development of the Telangana State.
