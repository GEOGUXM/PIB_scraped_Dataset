    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind in his message on the eve of Durga Puja has said:-


    "On the auspicious occasion of Durga Puja, I convey greetings and best wishes to all my fellow citizens in India and abroad.


    Durga Puja symbolises the victory of good over evil. The Puja also strengthens the belief that ultimately truth and justice prevail. This belief inspires us to follow the path of honesty, truth and justice. By doing so, we will succeed in taking the benefits of development to even the most deprived sections of society.


    This festival, celebrated at the onset of winter, is also an expression of our culture and social amity. Let us celebrate this festival with full fervour, enthusiasm and harmony”.
