      Posted On: 10 OCT 2019 8:05PM by PIB Delhi


    The Secretary, Department of Consumer Affairs today chaired an inter-ministerial meeting to take stock of the rise in prices of Tomatoes in some parts of the country including Delhi-NCR. The following key decisions have been taken to ensure that price rise is contained:

     1. The representatives of Ministry of Agriculture and Farmersâ€™ Welfare informed that supply has been hit due to incessant rains in Maharashtra and Karnataka and it will normalize in the next 10 days as monsoon rains are already receding.
     1. To mitigate the shortfall in availability of Tomatoes in Delhi, Safal has agreed to provide Tomato puree from all its outlets in Delhi at Rs. 25 per 200 gram pack which is equivalent to about 800 grams of Tomatoes. Another larger pack worth 825 grams worth Rs. 85 will also be made available which is equivalent to about 2.5 Kgs of Tomatoes. The stocks have already been moved to all the outlets and the sales will begin from tomorrow (11 th October, 2019) onwards at all booths.
        
     2. Tomato producing States will be requested to facilitate augmenting the supply from their respective States to regions which are in short supply including Delhi to improve availability and moderate prices. Tomato producing States have been regularly advised to interact with APMCs, Traders and Transporters to ensure regular supply. The same is being reiterated to 4 major Tomato producing States namely, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh so that prices normalize and supply is augmented immediately.
