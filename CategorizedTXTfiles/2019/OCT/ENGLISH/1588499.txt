    In the series of joint bilateral exercises between India & Mongolia, both nations have once again come together to enhance bilateral friendship to the next level. The fourteenth edition of joint military training exercise between Indian Army and Mongolian Army named EX NOMADIC ELEPHANT 2019 which commenced on 05 Oct 19 concluded at Foreign Training Node (FTN), Bakloh on 18 Oct 19.


    The primary focus of the exercise was to train and equip the contingents to undertake joint counter insurgency and counter terrorist operations in mountainous terrain under United Nations mandate. The entire curriculum was planned in a progressive manner wherein the participants initially familiarized with each other’s organizational structure, weapons and combat skills before graduating to joint tactical exercises. The contingents honed their tactical and technical skills in a wide spectrum of counter insurgency operations including joint training on weapons and equipment, cross training exercises and field training exercises. Both sides jointly planned and executed a series of well-developed tactical operations based on scenarios that are likely to be encountered in mountainous terrain.


    The exercise provided an ideal platform for both contingents to share their operational experience and expertise while also being instrumental in broadening the interoperability and cooperation between the armies of India and Mongolia.


    The joint exercise will surely foster the spirit of friendship and enhance the strategic military relationship between India and Mongolia to higher levels.
