    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind laid the foundation stone for Sri Sathya Sai Sanathana Samskruti Project at Sai no Sato, Kakegawa, Japan today (October 23, 2019). Sai no Sato will be developed as a temple on the lines of Akshardham and Swaminarayan Temple to promote Indian traditional culture.


    Speaking on the occasion, the President said that in today’s world, where we are searching for inner peace and happiness, looking to bring communities and cultures together, places like Sai no Sato provide us the right answers. We need not just one but many more such fonts of peaceful existence, where women and men can contemplate about self and society, individual and community and eliminate the distance between “us and them”.


    In the evening, the President also attended a banquet hosted in his honour by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan.


    Later in the night, the President will embark his return journey and expected to reach New Delhi in the early morning of October 24, 2019.
