      The Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan today reviewed oil and gas projects being undertaken in the Russian far-east, including India Russia joint collaborations. Far-east in Russia has vast mineral opportunities, with Russian government keen to partner with India. The proposed joint projects are expected to further add strength to our time-tested bilateral friendship.


      The Minister also visited the shipbuilding Complex, Zvezda. The Zvezda shipyard is poised to make a huge contribution in the development of Arctic shipping and developing shipping routes between Russia and India. Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi had visited the Zvezda ship building complex back in September’19 during his historic visit to Vladivostok, Russia. During Shri Pradhan’s visit to Zvezda, he was accompanied by CEO, Rosneft Mr Igor Sechin who demonstrated the cutting edge technologies there.
