    Former Prime Minister Shri H.D. Deve Gowda praised the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for the making of the world’s tallest statue of Sardar Vallabhai Patel in Gujarat. He also recalled that Ahmedabad airport was renamed as Sardar Vallabhai Patel International airport and Sardar Vallabhai Patel memorial was built in his home town in Nadiad, Gujarat in the past. These have been brought to a logical end by the construction of world’s tallest statue for the Iron Man of India. He also added that it had been made more attractive and indigenous and that is why people across the globe are visiting these places and enjoying the beauty of both the ‘Statue of Unity’ as well as ‘Sardar Sarovar Dam’. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has expressed happiness after former Prime Minister Shri H.D. Deve Gowda visited the Statue of Unity.
