    In a message, the President has said, "On the auspicious occasion of Vijayadashami, I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to all my fellow citizens and wish them success, prosperity and happiness.


    This festival is a celebration of the triumph of truth over untruth. It inspires us to live by the timeless values of honesty and truthfulness. The life of Lord Rama is in essence a reflection of these values which remain as relevant today as ever.
