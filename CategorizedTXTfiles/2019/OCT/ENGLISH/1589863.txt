      A clarification on the Naga settlement issue
      Posted On: 31 OCT 2019 7:51PM by PIB Delhi


    It has come to notice of the Government that lots of rumours and misinformation is being spread in media including social media that final Naga settlement has been arrived at and will be announced soon. This is creating anxiety and concern in some parts of the country.


    It is clarified that before any settlement is arrived at with Naga groups, all stakeholders including States of Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh will be duly consulted and their concerns will be taken into consideration.


    No credence needs to be given to such rumours and incorrect information.
