    The second edition of Naval Commanders' Conference of 2019 is scheduled at New Delhi from 22 to 24 Oct 19.

During the course of three days, the Chief of the Naval Staff, with the Commanders-in-Chief, will review major operational, materiel, logistics, HR, training and administrative activities undertaken during the previous six months and deliberate upon the course to be steered in the ensuing months.


    The Hon’ble Raksha Mantri will address the Naval Commanders on the opening day and interact with them. The conference also provides an opportunity for institutionalised interaction of Naval Commanders with senior Government officials to take ahead a number of inter-Ministerial initiatives towards development of a safe and secure maritime environment essential for holistic economic growth of the country.


    The deliberations during the Conference will focus on addressing the contemporary security paradigms whilst seeking ways to enhance the combat potential of the Navy and to make the operations more efficient. Accordingly, the theme of discussions will focus on the 'Functional Reorganisation of Indian Navy towards improving Operational Efficiency' and 'Optimal Manning' wherein contemporary issues pertaining to 'operations', maintenance', 'op-logistics', 'data management' and 'improvement of organisational practices' are listed for deliberations. The event also provides an opportunity for the Commanders to undertake detailed review of the performance of weapon/ sensors, readiness of IN platforms.


    All future operations would be planned and executed jointly by the three Services and therefore the ways to optimise joint planning structures, Tri-Service Synergy and operational readiness will be deliberated during the interaction with NSA, Chiefs of Indian Army and IAF. Commanders will also review the ongoing naval projects with a focus to enhance indigenisation through 'Make in India'.


    The half yearly conference also reviews the developments in the region with a view to assess the way ahead for implementation of initiatives towards the concept of SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) articulated by the Hon'ble PM.
