    As part of the annual training schedule of exercises, formations of the Army are conducting exercises in the Desert Sector of the Western Theatre and simultaneously exercises in the Eastern Theater.


    The aim of the Exercise was to synergise and validate the activities of all arms and services in high altitude environment.

    Such exercises are routinely carried out by the Army to evaluate the operational efficiency of formations & units and also to assess the leadership in exercising command and control for their reactions to emerging situations.


    Earlier, similar collective training was undertaken by another formation of Eastern Command in the Along Sector.
