    “I extend my warm greetings and good wishes to the people of our country on the auspicious occasion of Deepawali.


    Deepawali is heralded as one of the most significant festivals of India and is celebrated across the country and throughout the world.


    Deepawali or the ‘festival of lights’ is the celebration of the perpetual power of the good and its capability to conquer all evil. It tells us that truth and virtue alone triumph in the end. It inspires us to move from darkness towards light, from ignorance towards wisdom and from melancholy towards bliss.


    Diwali is the harbinger of hope and beckons to us to take the initiative to light a lamp rather than cursing the darkness. It is also a celebration of the light of humanity that burns within each and every one of us that is capable of showing us the path of righteousness even at the darkest of the times. Deepawali urges us to keep this light burning bright so that we may continue to endeavor to build a better, more humane, peaceful and compassionate world.


    May this festival bring harmony, prosperity and happiness in our lives.”
