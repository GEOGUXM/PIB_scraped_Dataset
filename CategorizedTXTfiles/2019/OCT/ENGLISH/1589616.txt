    A group of probationers of 69 th batch of Indian Revenue Service (Customs and Central Excise) called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, today (October 30, 2019) at Rashtrapati Bhavan.


    Addressing the probationers, the President said that boundaries of nations are opening up to greater economic cooperation. On the other hand, economic challenges are also making boundaries more crucial. IRS officers are going to be the guardians of our economic frontiers.


    The President said that with the objective of making the country more self-reliant, the government has launched the Make in India initiative. IRS officers’ role with respect to it is that tax administrators should strive to provide an environment within which trade and industry can thrive. Their motto with respect to international trade should be: ‘Border divides, Customs connect’. This will help transform India to a 5 trillion dollar economy.
