    India is exporting its handmade carpets to more than 70 countries in the world, mainly to the USA, Germany, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, France, Italy and Brazil. Recently, exports have also started to China.


    Germany and other European countries were the traditional markets for export of Indian products followed by USA. The European markets have been fully developed and have reached saturation point. The Council has envisaged USA, LAC Countries - Brazil, Chile, Argentina, China, Scandinavian Countries - Norway, Sweden & South Africa and Oceania Countries – Australia & New Zealand as thrust countries.


    There is a huge scope of investment in this sectorto setup units to produce carpets and other floor coverings in order to discourage imports and also fulfil domestic requirements.


    Indian Handmade Carpet Industry is highly labour intensive and provides employment to over 20 lakh workers and artisans especially women directly or indirectly in the rural areas. Most of the artisans and weavers employed in this sector are from the weaker section of the society and this trade provides extra and alternate occupation to them at their homes.
