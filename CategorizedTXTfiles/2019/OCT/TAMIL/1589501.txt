    Union Minister of State (I/C) for Youth Affairs & Sports and Minority Affairs Shri.Kiren Rijiju inaugurated the Sri. N.P.V. Ramaswamy Udayar Hockey Centre for Sports Science at the Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research in Chennai today (29.10.2019).


    In his inaugural address , Shri. Kiren Rijiju said there is no beautiful event is the world than Olympics and there is no any other pride for the nation than sports. This government is trying to support sport persons to increase the number of Olympic Champions from India and the PM has constituted Olympic task force for this purpose, he added. To bring up the sport culture, government is taking several steps like bringing transparency, giving equal opportunity for all in the sports sectors, stated Minister.


    “Monetary support is inevitable for the development. Earlier, when a sport person wins a game abroad, they will get price money from the government, but it will take time. So, we have decided and ensured that the price money won by the sports person will be ready before they land in India, and the cheque will be provided as soon as they reach” Shri Kiren Rijiju said.


    Our target now should be winning top 10 medals in 2028 Olympics. And the government has already started its preparatory work, he said.


    Centre provides all facilities, from food, travel to technical support to the players in our national team, the minister stated.


    “To bring the sports to the next level, sports is a part of curriculum in the new education policy. This is a major shift we are taking forward, which will make sports as the central part of the education system” he added.
