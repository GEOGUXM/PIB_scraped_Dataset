    Smuggling of firecrackers of Chinese origin and their illegal sale in the Indian Market is a matter of serious concern. The import of firecrackers is ‘Restricted’ and as such any person who, in relation to, acquires possession of or is in anyway concerned in carrying, depositing, harbouring, keeping, concealing, selling or purchasing or in any other manner dealing with Chinese fire crackers will be punished under Customs Act, 1962.


    The use of Chinese crackers are against Explosive Rules, 2008 and is harmful as they contain banned chemicals like red lead, copper oxide, lithium, etc. These chemicals are also highly dangerous and inimical to the environment.
