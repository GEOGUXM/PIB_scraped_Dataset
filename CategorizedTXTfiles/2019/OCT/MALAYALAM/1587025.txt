    3 PHASE MEMU


    Palakkad Division will soon replace single phase DC conventional MEMU to 3 Phase AC MEMU.


    The division is expected to receive 3 rakes of 3 Pahse MEMU shortly(One rake consisit of 2 motor cars and 6 trailer cars-total 8 cars).


    3 Phase MEMU (Main line Electrical Multiple Unit) rake which works with highly advanced technology and is passenger friendly features.


    3 phase MEMU rake is highly advantageous as it propels with 3 phase AC propulsion system consisting of ‘insulated-gate bipolar transistor’ (IGBT) and facilitates improved acceleration and braking performance and therefore run faster compared to conventional MEMU.


    It is indigenously manufactured by ICF and has energy efficient electric traction propulsion system supported by regenerative braking that can save up to 35% energy compared to conventional MEMU.


    The electricity generated in this process would be fed into the grid. It is not only energy-efficient but also requires less maintenance because of robust 3 phase AC squirrel cage induction motors drive in place of DC series motors and introduction of oil-free compressor.


    The 8 car rake formation consists of stainless steel body coaches with easy to slide, light weight sliding doors and fiber reinforced polymer interior panels. Also CCTV surveillance system, LED lights, LED indication when a chain is pulled and a GPS based passenger information system are provided in all the coaches.


    Among the features of this MEMU that are likely to appeal to passengers are ergonomically designed seats, air bellows for secondary suspension for comfort riding, an increase in carrying capacity of 2402 passengers (seating 614 + standing 1788) and bio-toilets. Moreover, the cabins of motormen and guard are air-conditioned to provide them with a comfortable working atmosphere.


    Advantages of 3 phase MEMU over conventional MEMU


    Technical features:


    1. IGBT based converter–inverter and maintenance free high power squirrel cage Induction Motors are provided.


    2. Microprocessor based control system with built in fault diagnosis for smoother control, facilitating trouble shooting and easy maintenance.


    3. Regenerative Braking is provided. During braking, the Traction Motors are working as generators and the Kinetic Energy on the wheels are converted into Electrical Energy and fed back to OHE thereby saving 35% of total energy.


    4. Online monitoring and downloading of TCMS data through ERMS (EMU Remote Monitoring System).


    5. 10.4” Touch Screen DDU (Driver Display Unit) is provided in each cab to provide information about TCMS to support Motorman in operating the rake during normal operation as well as in case of malfunction of any system.


    6. Air spring is provided in secondary stage suspension. In case of failure, DDU will indicate the status and the speed of the train will be restricted to 55 kmph.


    7. PIS, Intercom and PA system are provided.
