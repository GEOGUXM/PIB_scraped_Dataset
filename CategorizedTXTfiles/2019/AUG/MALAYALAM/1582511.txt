    On the basis of a request for assistance received PM 20 Aug from the Hon'ble Minister of State for External Affairs, Shri V. Muraleedharan as well as District Collector, Kozhikode to search for a fisherman who had been missing off Madappally in Onchiyam, Kozhikode district since 18 Aug 201, a Seaking helicopter of the Indian Naval Air Squadron (INAS) 336 was launched by Southern Naval Command(SNC) from INS Garuda, Kochi at first light on 21 Aug.


    The aircraft undertook an intensive search for the missing fisherman on reaching the area and after 30 minutes, the crew spotted a floating human corpse at around 08:15 am. Since the body was observed to be decomposed and bloated, it was decided not to winch it up directly, but instead to guide a fishing vessel 'Thaliyilappan', which was in the vicinity, to the location. The fishing vessel subsequently was able to recover the body.


    The aircraft was flown by Lieutenant Commander Vaibhav Gupta, Lieutenant Commander Himanshu Chaudhary and assisted by Flight Divers TP Singh and SK Sahani.
