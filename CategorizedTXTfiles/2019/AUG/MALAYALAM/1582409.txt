    Kochi: Those facing scarcity of quality of soil for farming do not need to worry anymore. The soil-less mix, developed by the Ernakulam Krishi Vigyan Kendra of the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), that can be used as an alternative to soil in farming, is now ready for sale on all working days from CMFRI.


    This mix is made of composted pressmud, a by-product from sugar mills along with coirpith, powdered cowdung, neem cake and biocontrol agents.


    The soil-less mix will be a stimulus to backyard farming in the city where availability of quality soil is a challenge, says Dr Shinoj Subramannian, Head of the KVK. As plants can be directly planted to the 10 kg bag of the mix, no separate growbags are required. A bag of 10 kg is priced at Rs. 125.


    “Scarcity of quality soil is one of the major challenges being faced by the organic farmers in the city. Normally, at least 150 kg of soil is required to grow plants in 30 growbags”, Dr Shinoj said.


    “We are also happy to transfer the technology to anybody interested in the product.”, he said. For those interested in producing the mix may contact at 8281757450.
