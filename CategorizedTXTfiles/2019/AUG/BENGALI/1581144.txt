    Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI) has decided to reach out to various districts of West Bengal with courses on ‘Digital Film Making’ and ‘Screen Acting’ under National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC). For this, SRFTI is launching the course at Barrackpore for North 24 Parganas tomorrow (August 3). The initiative was launched on July 28, last year, from Chandannagar to cover Hooghly district, then Durgapur to cover Paschim Bardhaman and then Kolkata.


    The courses are collaborated with Peerless Skill Academy, Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission and NSDC Certification. In every course, students between 18 years and 68 years of age from nearby districts as well as the adjoining States are participating.


    SRFTI will also cover neighbouring States with the courses to create interest for making good cinema among people with creative abilities.
