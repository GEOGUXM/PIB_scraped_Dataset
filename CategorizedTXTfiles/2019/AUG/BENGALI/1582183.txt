    Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa inaugurated a two-day Commanders Conclave of Eastern Air Command (EAC) at the HQ EAC, Upper Shillong on 16 August 2019. Air Marshal RD Mathur, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, EAC welcomed the CAS and introduced the commanders to him.


    The CAS, during his address to the commanders on the inaugural day of the conclave, exhorted them to be in operational readiness to take on any task to safeguard the skies of the nation. He discussed the prevailing security scenario and emphasised on the need for all air warriors to remain ever vigilant so that any attempt to degrade the operational efficiency of Indian Air Force could be easily thwarted. He cautioned that while constant vigil must be maintained to counter the physical threat, at the same time one should also guard against becoming target to propagation of false information through social media.


    The CAS reiterated that the IAF is in the process of transformation through modernisation as well as upgradation of existing fleets and weapon systems. However, this also brings with it some challenges. There is an urgent requirement that all IAF personnel adapt themselves to the rapidly changing inventory and associated high technology. He also conveyed his appreciation on successful completion of various exercises conducted by HQ EAC.


    Earlier on arrival, the Air Chief accompanied by Smt Kamalpreet Dhanoa, President Air Force Wives Welfare Association (AFWWA) were received by AOC-in-C, EAC and Smt Shipra Mathur, President AFWWA (Regional). A Ceremonial Guard of Honour was accorded to the CAS on his arrival.
