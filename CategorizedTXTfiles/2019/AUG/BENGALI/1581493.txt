    Kolkata, August 7, 2019.
    
    The Ministry of Human Resource Development under its National Mission
    on Education through Information and Communication Technology
    (NMEICT), has launched the National Digitat'bibrary of India (NOL
    India) project to develop a framework of virtual repository of
    learning resources with a single-window search facility. NOL has been
    integrated with UMANG app and the user can register through
    https://ndl.gov.in or through mobile app that is available at play
    store. As of now, there are more than 3 crore digital resources
    available through the NOL. The contents cover almost all major domains
    of education and all major levels of learners including life-long
    learners. More than 50 lakh students have registered themselves in the
    NDL, with about 20 lakhs active users.
    
    Since the NOL is a national asset, it is expected that all Ministries
    and departments should be aware of this national facility and should
    use and contribute to NDL. Popularizing the NOL will enhance the
    utilization of e-resources by the users.
