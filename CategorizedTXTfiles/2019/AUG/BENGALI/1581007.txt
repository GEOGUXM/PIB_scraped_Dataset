    Fifty-two containers loaded on Inland Vessel MV Bhavya bound for Patna sailed from Haldia on river Ganga (National Waterway-1) on Tuesday morning (July 30, 2019). The containers belonging to M/s Adani Logistic Ltd. carrying edible oil of Adani Wilmar will reach its destination in nine to 10 days covering a distance of 955 Kilometers.

    
    
    
    This movement is country's largest container movement through Inland Water Transport (IWT) and stands as a testimony to the readiness of National Waterway-1 (River Ganga) in providing a seamlessly enabled fairway.
    
    
    
    On Wednesday (July 31, 2019), IWAI Chairman Shri Pravir Pandey along with Shri Vinit Kumar, Chairman Kolkata Port Trust, Shri Anil Kishore Singh, CEO, Inland Waterways Division, Adani Ports and SEZ and other senior government officials flagged off the vessel at Kolkata's Garden Reach Jetty-II for its onward journey.
    
    
    
    The movement could be made possible as Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has put a robust ecosystem of fairway, berthing, pilotage, river information systems and night navigation facilities on river Ganga. Maintenance dredging is being carried out on the NW-1 to ensure the Least Assured Depth of three metres.
    
    
    
    While a state-of-the-art Rs 517 Cr multimodal terminal ( MMT) at Haldia is at the penultimate stage of readiness, IWAI is likely to deliver the Rs 281 Cr MMT at Sahibganj in Jharkhand in August, 2019. The country's first riverine MMT (at Varanasi in Sahibganj) built at a cost of Rs 170 Cr was dedicated to the nation by the Prime Minister in November last year.
