    Today, on 22nd August 2019, at the inaugural function, Shri Vinay Kumar Saxena, Chairman KVIC said :


    “The Khadi is a heritage, it has unique eco- friendly nature and comes with vivid fabric qualities, It is a gift by Mahatma Gandhi and it is making steady progress under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Even today after 72 years the fabric continues to inspire and amaze creative minds across all international borders. Known as the “Fabric of India”, Khadi has proven to be culture in itself, one that truly exhibits the pride of the country’s achievements. “


    He further added, “Under the leadership of Prime Mnister, Khadi’s average growth, which was 6.18% in 2014 has jumped to 28% in the year 2019. Total turnover of Khadi has also increased from 889 cr. to Rs. 3215 cr. In the last four years.


    Khadi as well as village industries are making steady progress. We have lots of designers, skilled workers among us. The new promotion and marketing policy introduced by central government is very effective. Khadi is a vibrant industry. In the year 2014, the daily production of Khadi was only 103.66 million sq. meter which increased by 70% to reach 170 million sq meter in 2019.


    When the world has moved towards automation, Khadi is unique in retaining its nature of manual craft. Public needs to buy Khadi product to help these craftsmen.


    Ms. Preeta Varma, Chief Executive Officer, KVIC addressing the media said, Khadi is a fabric that bonds two centuries, the 20th and 21st Century and is the epitome of sustainable fashion. The collection by the designers was a real delight, she added.


    KVIC show unveiled the collections of three designers who gave their distinct stylish touches to Khadi and ensured that the Fabric of India moved into the New Age with fashionable millennial creativity.
