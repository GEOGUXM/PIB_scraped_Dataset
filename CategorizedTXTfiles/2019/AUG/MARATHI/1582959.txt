    The postman is the face and the brand ambassador of the postal Department , diligently performing his duty during his duty hours, without thinking of himself for a moment. However , considering the nature of work of postmen, stress, tensions and adverse eating habits affect the health graph of the post staff. To inculcate healthy eating habits among postmen, Mumbai Region organized a "Fitness Mantra" session at Bicentennial Hall of Mumbai GPO on 25th August, 2019.


    The session was addressed by Rujuta Diwekar, winner of the "Nutrition Award" from Asian Institute of Gastroenterology and the country's foremost speaker on health and wellness. Her message was loud and clear, urging postmen to use common sense and un-complicate the act of eating. She emphasized on a blend of traditional food wisdom and modern nutrition science for a healthy body and mind, best reflected through the mantra, Eat local, think global.


    During the session, the entire postal fraternity of Mumbai Region were present. The main aim of today's function was to create awareness about health & fitness among the postmen. The session ended with a smile on the faces of the postmen along with the glow of positivity in their eyes.
