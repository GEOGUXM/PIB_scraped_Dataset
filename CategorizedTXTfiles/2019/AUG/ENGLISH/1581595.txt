As a step towards further management of litigation by the Government, the monetary limits for filing Departmental appeals before various appellate fora including ITAT, High Court & Supreme Court have been revised as under:

    This will further reduce time, effort and resources presently deployed in litigation to focus on issues involving litigation of substantial value.
