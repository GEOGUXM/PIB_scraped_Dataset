     In A Cult Of Their Own: Bollywood Beyond Box Office (English )  Author : Amborish Roychoudhury  Rupa Publications India Pvt. Ltd  IN a Cult of Their Own: Bollywood Beyond Box Office, by Amborish Roychoudhury is a unique look at various genres of Hindi cinema that fuses the serious with the tongue in cheek. The author fluidly writes on some of the cult films, including some which have acquired their legendary status because of reasons other than cinematic. This book is a fine example of how cinema criticism can transcend quality or the lack of it in cinema itself.
