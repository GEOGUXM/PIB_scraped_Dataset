    Khadi and Village Industry Commission (KVIC) distributed as many as 50 leather kits and 350 Bee-Boxes with live bee colonies in tribal-dominated village in Sirohi district of Rajasthan, one of the aspirational districts in India identified by the NITI Aayog, on World Tribal Day today.


    While addressing the villagers, KVIC Chairman Vinai Kumar Saxena said that programmes like Leather Mission, Kumhar Sashaktikaran Mission and Honey Mission are the reflection of KVIC`s commitment to uplift the lives of marginalised communities in society.


    He said that KVIC is launching a new programme ‘Leather Mission’ on World Tribal Day from the tribal-dominated village of Chandala. Under this new programme, KVIC will give Leather Kits to the leather artisans across the nation. It will not only increase their incomes manifold but will also inspire the traditional leather artisans who had migrated to other jobs from their traditional skill to adopt this vocation again,.”


    350 Bee-Boxes were distributed at the function. Honey Mission has proved as a game-changer in the lives of tribals, farmers, SC/STs and unemployed youths. So far, KVIC has distributed over 1.15 lakh Bee-Boxes across the nation among the marginalised community, which has provided jobs to over 11,500 people. It has not only increased the income of the bee-keeping farmers, but has also increased the yield of the crops by up to 30 percent due to cross-pollination of the honey-bees.
