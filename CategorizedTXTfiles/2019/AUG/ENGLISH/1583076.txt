Government under three (3) OALPRounds have already awarded Eighty-Seven (87) Blocks covering an area of 1,18,280 Sq. Kmwith leading E&P companies.


    In continuation to its determination for reduction in import dependency of oil and gas and accelerating E&P activities, the Government notified further policy reforms in upstream sector on 28 th February, 2019 to increase exploration activities, attract domestic and foreign investment in unexplored/unallocated areas of sedimentary basins and promote ease of doing business by streamlining and expediting the approval processes.


    The Government has now launched the Bid Round-IV for International Competitive Bidding from 27th August, 2019 which will be carried out under the revised policy framework . In this bid round,7 blocks, with an area of approximately 18,500 sq. km., are being offered for bidding to the investor community.

    The exploration acreage of India has been enhanced from 90,000 square kilometers in 2017 to 2,10,000 sq. km after successful completion of three OALP rounds under HELP and is expected to rise with upcoming bidding rounds. To further increase exploration acreage of India, Government has increased EoI cycles from two (2) to three (3) in a year with the revised dates of April 1 to July 31, August 1 to November 30 and December 1 to March 31.
