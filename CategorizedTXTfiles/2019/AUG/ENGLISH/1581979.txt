    Doordarshan has been carrying sign language interpretation of the address of President of India on the eve of Independence Day and Prime Minister’s address from the ramparts of Red Fort on Independence Day every year. This year too, President’s address and the entire function from Red Fort will be telecast live with sign language interpretation on DD Bharati channel.


    In a major step towards implementation of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting has decided to implement Accessibility Standards for Persons with Disabilities in television programmes for private TV channels also from this Independence Day.


    In a significant beginning from this year’s Independence Day, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting has asked Private Satellite News TV channels also to telecast a short programme on Independence Day Celebrations, along with corresponding sign language interpretation, in the afternoon/evening of 15th August. The channels have been told that they may either make their own programme with sign language interpretation, or, if they wish, they may carry a bulletin prepared by DD News free of cost. This information was given by Shri Amit Khare, Secretary, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting while speaking at a function organized by NCPEDP at IIC, New Delhi. Ministry of I&B was given Special Jury Award at this function for its path breaking work in making television accessible for people with hearing disabilities.
