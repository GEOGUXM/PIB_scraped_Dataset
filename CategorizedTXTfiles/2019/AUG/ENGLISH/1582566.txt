We are happy to extend capacity building, skill development and financing assistance to support Zambia’s growth and development.


    The President said that the bilateral trade and investment partnership between India and Zambia is impressive. But the two countries can do a lot more together. Indian investments in Zambia have contributed to Zambian growth and development. Indian companies are keen to further invest in Zambia. They are looking at new investment opportunities in the mining, health, infrastructure and energy sectors.
