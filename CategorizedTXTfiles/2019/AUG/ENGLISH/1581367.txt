National Handloom Day seeks to focus on the contribution of handloom to the socio economic development of the country and also increase the income of weavers.


    The Union Government had declared 7 th of August as the National Handloom Day in July 2015 with the objective of generating awareness about the importance of the handloom industry to the socio economic development of the country. August 7 was chosen as the National Handloom Day to commemorate the Swadeshi Movement which was launched on this day in 1905 in Calcutta Town Hall to protest against the partition of Bengal by the British Government. The movement had aimed at reviving domestic products and production processes.


    The first National Handloom Day was inaugurated on 7 th August 2015 by the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, at the centenary of Madras University in Chennai.
