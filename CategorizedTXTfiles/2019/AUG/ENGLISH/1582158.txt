    Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh today visited Pokhran in Rajasthan where India had conducted nuclear tests in 1998 under the leadership of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and paid homage to him on his first death anniversary . In a series of tweets, Shri Rajnath Singh described Atal ji as one of the stalwarts of Independent India and added that it is his good fortune that he has got this opportunity to pay deepest respects to the former Prime Minister at Pokhran.


    Raksha Mantri said, “ Pokhran is the area which witnessed Atal ji’s firm resolve to make India a nuclear power and yet remain firmly committed to the doctrine of ‘No First Use’. India has strictly adhered to this doctrine. What happens in future depends on the circumstances.”


    Shri Rajnath Singh said India attaining the status of a responsible nuclear nation is a matter of national pride for every citizen of the country and the nation will remain indebted to the greatness of Atal ji.
