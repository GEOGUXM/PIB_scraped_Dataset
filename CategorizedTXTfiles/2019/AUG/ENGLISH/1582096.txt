    The Vice President of India, Shri M Venkaiah Naidu has advised the Ministry of HRD to expedite the preparation of detailed project report on the proposed setting up of NCERT Regional Institute of Education at Nellore in Andhra Pradesh.


    He also told the Union Minister for HRD, Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal, who called on the Vice President at his residence today, to further strengthen the Center of Excellence for Studies in Classical Telugu located at Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL), Mysuru and shift the Center to a suitable location in either of the Telugu states (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana).


    Shri Naidu also wanted the HRD Ministry to expedite the setting up of various educational institutions sanctioned under AP Reorganization Act.


    The HRD Minister expressed his willingness to act on Vice Presidentâ€™s suggestions.


    The foundation-stone for the Regional Institute of Education- NCERT was laid jointly by the Vice President of India on December 27 2016 when he was the Union Minister for Urban Development and Shri Prakash Javadekar, who was the Minister for HRD at that time.


    The opening of the RIE fulfills the long-standing demand of the region. The new institution at Nellore shall offer teacher education programmes like B.Sc/BA B.Ed, M.Ed and Ph.D, apart from conducting research on education, it would help in capacity building of Teachers and Teacher Educators and strengthen implementation of Government of India Schemes like SSA, RMSA and ICT in schools. The State Government had allotted 50 acres of land free of cost on the National Highway at Kanupuru Bit-II, near NH-16 Venkatachalm Mandal, Nellore in Andhra Pradesh.


    The Secretary Education, Shri R Subrahmanyam and Shri Hrushikesh Senapaty, Director NCERT and other senior officials were present at the meeting.
