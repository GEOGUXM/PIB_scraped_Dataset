    Congratulating the winners of the awards and greeting everyone on the occasion of the International Youth Day, Sh Rijiju said that the Ministry is organizing various programmes to motivate youth, under the guidance of Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narender Modi ji. The National Youth Awards Function is one such programme. He stressed that India is a young country filled with immense potential. The development of the country is in the hands of youth who can shape its future. If the energy of youth is channelized in right direction, the progress of country in various fields can gain momentum, and youth can become prosperous. The Minister said that the youth are idealistic, aim high and when they achieve their goals through their efforts, it becomes necessary to grant recognition to their efforts, which has been attempted through this program.

He said that one should not age in thoughts and action, and should remain young at heart.
