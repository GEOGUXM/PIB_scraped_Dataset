      Posted On: 02 AUG 2019 6:05PM by PIB Delhi


    Considering the important role being played by Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) in the economic development, it was announced in the Budget Speech for 2019-20 that the Government would provide a one time six monthsâ€™ partial credit guarantee to PSBs for the first loss of up to 10 percent to enable them to purchase pooled assets of financially sound NBFCs amounting to Rs. 1 lakh crore. This would ease the liquidity stress in the NBFC sector and increase the access of these NBFCs to bank finance, and, in turn enable them to continue to play their role in meeting the financing requirements of the productive sectors of the economy.


    The Government has received a proposal from RBI on draft modalities of the guarantee to operationalize the above Budget announcement. The Government has accorded its approval to the modalities that would set in motion by RBI. The Department of Financial Services, Ministry of Finance would put in place an oversight mechanism for this scheme.
