    The correct norms of infant and young child feeding are:

      * Initiation of Breastfeeding within an hour of birth
      * Exclusive breastfeeding for first six months of life i.e. only breast Milk ‘NO’ other milk, food, drink or water
      * Appropriate and adequate complementary feeding from six months of age while continuing breastfeeding
      * Continued breastfeeding up to the age of two years or beyond

    The activities being organized during the World Breastfeeding Week are symposiums for lactating mothers and anganwadi workers to create awareness about the importance of breastfeeding, annaprashan ceremony of babies at anganwadi centres by collecting beneficiaries from adjoining anganwadi centres , c ompetition on nutritious recipes and quiz competitions.

According to WHO, increasing breastfeeding to near-international levels will help in saving more than 800 000 lives every year, the majority being children under 6 months.
