      Posted On: 24 AUG 2019 11:00PM by PIB Delhi


      The way you welcomed me made me feel like I am within India. I am overwhelmed with your love and affection and I bow down in front of you all.


      I express my heartfelt gratitude to His Highness King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, to His Highness Prime Minister, to the Government of Bahrain, and to the people of this place for giving so much love and respect.


      I realize that the Prime Ministers of India took too long to visit Bahrain. But I am fortunate to be the first Indian Prime Minister to come to Bahrain and receive your blessings. It seems that God has left a lot of work to be done by me.


      Friends,


      While coming here on the stage, I could see the spectacular presentation of the cultural heritage of India; be it Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, every language of India was adorned with magnificent colours of unity, and unity in diversity. This diversity of India and these colours of Indianness are our strength. This iridescent image of India amazes and attracts the whole world.


      Friends,


      Although I have come here as the head of the government or as the Prime Minister, but my aim is to meet the Indians settled here and to communicate with lakhs of Bahraini friends. And I am trying to give freshness and modernity of 21st century to the five thousand year old relationships.


      I want those relations that Sumer and Dilmun had with the Indus Valley should reach new heights in 21st century between India and Bahrain, and I am here before you as a partner for the same. I have come to invite lakhs of Bahraini friends towards new opportunities and new horizons in the New India of 130 crore dreams.


      Sisters and brothers,


      Our relations with Bahrain have been about trade and business, but more than anything else, it has been about humanity, sentiments, culture and values. This connection of thousands of years has left its mark on both the countries.


      I have had a very fruitful conversation with His Highness Prime Minister. Apart from further strengthening this strong cooperation between us, we have decided to improve our relationship in new areas such as space.


      I am very excited to meet His Majesty, the King. I am very grateful to him for sending me the invitation. The societies of both countries have long received a lot from each other, especially our family values. The societies of both countries have given a lot of priority to it. We have considered a strong and a robust family system as the basis for empowerment of the society.


      Friends,


      This day marks the auspicious festival of Janmashtami. My best wishes to you and to the Indian community spread across the world on Shri Krishna Janmotsav. I have been told that there is still the tradition of narrating Krishna Katha on Janmashtami in the Gulf region. Indians, especially Gujarat and Gujaratis have a special love and reverence for Lord Krishna.


      Even today, the tradition of Rasleela commemorating Sri Krishna is followed in the villages of Gujarat. Bahrain has an old connection with Gujarat. So it is quite natural that Lord Krishna’s flute will echo in your heart and there is affection towards the king of Dwarka, Lord Krishna.


      It is my privilege that tomorrow I will go to the temple of Srinath ji and pray for you and your host country's prosperity and peace. It is the oldest temple in this entire region. Recently, this temple f Srinathji has turned two hundred years old.


      I know how you and the devotees from India have celebrated this occasion with reverence and joy. It is also a matter of great pleasure that the redevelopment work of this temple will formally start from tomorrow. This temple is a living reflection of the faith in you and is also a symbol of Bahrain's outstanding tradition of harmonizing diversity.


      I have had conversations with many people there. And based on what I have seen and heard, I can say that Bahrain's society has kept the tradition of Indian faith very comfortable.


      Friends,


      This has been possible because our relationship has not only been with the governments but also with the culture and the society. You have a major role in Bahrain's growth story. The soil here has given you, your dreams and the dreams of your loved ones a new flight, new wings and new opportunities.


      Whenever I hear praises for the Indian friends, the business associates here, the people settled here and the friends who work here from the government here, my heart fills with joy.


      Even today when His Highness, the Prime Minister of Bahrain was praising you so much about your efforts, your culture and behaviour, my heart swelled with pride.


      There is a positive feedback regarding honesty, loyalty, workability of Indians and your contribution to the socio-economic life of this place. You have curved a niche for yourself here with your hard work. And the biggest thing is that you have created a place in the hearts of the people here. We have to strengthen this goodwill.


      Friends,


      Now your contribution to the development of India is also commendable. Your hard work is also proving to be useful for your loved ones living in India; it is being used to raise the standard of living of your family.


      Friends,


      Today, ease of living is our priority in India. In New India, no one should be deprived of his basic needs. Thus, many diverse steps are being taken for the same. Today when you talk to your family and relatives living in India, you can feel the change. I just want to ask you one thing. May I ask? Do you feel this change? Do you see the changing attitude of India? Sure?


      Has the self confidence of India and Indians not increased? Are you living with your heads high or not? Are you able to talk eyeball to eyeball or not? This is happening because in the last five years, the emphasis has been laid on making the lives of ordinary citizens easier.


      We have taken the initiative to provide electricity, gas connection and every such basic facility for crores of poor families of the country. Today almost every family in India is connected with banking. Mobile phone, internet is accessible to the common family of India. India provides the cheapest internet data in the world. Today, efforts are being made to make the delivery of most of the services in India digitally. Social security is also being provided to the families.


      Be it insurance or pension – these are being made available to the poorest of the poor at a very nominal premium. Moreover, arrangement has been made to provide free treatment up to five lakh rupees to about 50 crore Indians.


      Friends,


      This is the change due to which 130 crore Indians have given us an opportunity to serve you once again by electing this government with a greater mandate than before. Every Indian has believed that India's dreams, hopes and aspirations can be fulfilled and resolutions can be achieved. This servant of India, on the basis of the same belief, is busy accomplishing the new resolutions. Our goals are high, but when you have the support of 130 crore people, then you get more encouragement.


      India is moving forward today, not only with the efforts of the government but with the participation of crores of Indians. And friends, I am not hesitant to say this. And I want to bow my head and say that the government is just on the steering, while the enthusiasm and courage of the people of the country are the accelerators.


      Friends,


      India has now decided that in the coming five years, she will try to double the size of the economy and turn it into a five trillion dollar economy. Today we have placed a target in front of us. For us, five trillion dollar economy is not just a figure but a means of empowering the common Indian. If the economy doubles, the income of every Indian household will also increase. The purchasing power of the most ordinary citizen will also increase.


      Brothers and sisters,


      We have the potential and a plan to reach this target of five trillion dollars and we are fully prepared to sweat it out. We have not yet started the work to achieve this goal but have built a strong foundation in the last five years. Today India is making extensive improvements in every Global Ranking. India has also improved the ranking of the World Intellectual Property Organization's Global Innovation Index, the Global Competitiveness Index of the World Economy Forum, and India has also improved its ranking among the Ten FDI Destinations listed by UNCTAD.


      In Ease of doing business, we also aim to be in the top 50 countries. As a result of this, Foreign Direct Investment is flowing into India at a record level today. I am sure our friends from Bahrain will also be keener to take advantage of this unprecedented investment environment in India.


      Friends,


      Today, unprecedented work is being done in the field of physical and digital infrastructure in India. Roadways, Highways, Railways, Airways, Waterways, I-ways are being laid. A target of investing Rs 100 lakh crore has been set in the country's infrastructure sector in the coming five years.


      Talking about digital infrastructure, today India is one of the most digitally connected countries in the world with the provision of mobile phones and Aadhaar. Now work is being done to provide broadband connectivity in every gram panchayat of the country at a rapid pace. Work is also being done at different levels for 5G connectivity in the country. We have a huge and extensive treasure trove of data.


      The Indian model of digital transaction is now being discussed all over the world. All of you have also been one of the greatest beneficiaries of the digital revolution in India. You all must have experienced how difficult it was to talk to your family, your relatives and to send money there till five years ago. Now you can do all these things very easily.


      Facilities like Bhim App, UPI and Jan-Dhan accounts have made banking in India accessible to the common man. Our RuPAY card is now becoming a preferred mode of transaction all over the world. Banks and sellers across the world are now accepting our RuPAY card.


      I am glad that you will be able to transact in Bahrain soon with the RuPAY card. Today MoU has been signed for the use of RuPAY card here and this will give you the facility of cashless transaction, but we further intend to ensure that you can send money to your home in India through RuPay card so that the cost of sending money is reduced and the transaction is also secured. Now you can also ask your friends from Bahrain to make payments with RuPAY card.


      Friends,


      Till some time ago rupee was used here. Rupee was in circulation here. Now a few days later the RuPAY card will start circulating here.


      Brothers and sisters,


      RuPay Card is one of the systems in India that is providing seamless connectivity to the entire country. Today, India is moving towards one nation one card for seamless mobility. Today there is one nation one grid for power supply across India and One nation one tax in the form of GST for entire India.


      There are many arrangements that are being made to make life and business in India easier. The important thing is that all these solutions are being provided in India itself by the Indian youth. Today, India is working seriously on this concept of 'local solution for global application'.


      Friends,


      India has shown its power to the world. Today India's talent is becoming a global identity of India. It is doing such wonders for India as well as the world that everyone is surprised. In big projects of the world, in the research of future related technologies, and in major institutions of the world Indians are showcasing their talent.


      At the same time, new dimensions of success are being created one after another in India. You all know that India's Chandrayaan is going to land on the lunar surface on September 7th. The entire world is discussing India's space missions today. The capabilities of our ISRO scientists and our engineers are being praised all over the world.


      The world is surprised as to how we are able to achieve such results only on the basis of our skill, efficiency and discipline with such a limited budget. Actually this is our strength and this is our advantage. We rely on unmatched will, not just budget. This unmatched will helps us to achieve big goals.


      Brothers and sisters,


      The nation is made up of proudly held heads, not just borders. In the last five years, we have tried to ensure that the 130 crore Indians within the country and crores of Indians living abroad, will always keep their heads high. Lakhs of Indians like you are a strong link between India's relations with the world. Today, lakhs of friends like you are one of the greatest reasons that the world looks up to India with respect. I assure you that the way the Government of India has stood by you in your good and bad times; it is ready to serve you with full strength in the future too.


      Friends,


      Our independent India will become 75 years old by the year 2022. Every Indian has taken several resolutions for this important occasion. I will urge you also to take some new resolutions at your level. For example, you can decide that every person, every year will motivate some of his/her Bahrain friends for India tour. You will show them everything from the beautiful hill stations of India to its rich spiritual and cultural heritage. Also discuss with your Bahraini friends about India's quality medical and meditation tourism.


      This year is very important anyway. This year Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary will be celebrated. Although this festival will be celebrated all over the world including Bahrain, but what could be a better place than India to connect with Gandhiji in the true sense?


      Friends,


      We will be able to fulfill our responsibilities towards India properly only when we are connected whole heartedly with the resolutions of Bahrain. I was told that His Highness and the young citizens here have started a campaign to clean their seas. I appeal to all of you to participate actively in this campaign.


      In India too, we have launched a successful and comprehensive campaign on cleanliness. Now India has decided that by the year 2022, she will be liberated from single use plastic.


      Moreover, a massive mission has been started to save water and to bring water to every house. You can also participate actively in this campaign. You can take the initiative to revive and adopt the wells, step-wells, ponds and lakes of your ancestral village with which you and your parents' childhood memories are associated.


      Friends,


      If we work for the common interests and common values ​​of Bahrain and India, then our historical relations will definitely touch new heights in the 21st century. Both India and Bahrain are ancient civilizations but modern nations with full of potential. I am sure that lakhs of Indian ambassadors like you will give more strength to this strong thread of relationship.


      Friends,


      I am a duty bound person. On one hand, Bahrain is full of excitement and enthusiasm. The country is celebrating Janmashtami, the birth of Lord Krishna. But at the same time, I am amidst you in a deep mourning and pain. Since the time we were students, the friend with whom I have spent my public life and have moved step by step in the political journey together, with whom I was connected to every moment, fighting together, dreaming together and fulfilling those dreams, that friend with whom we have made such a long journey together, that friend, Arun Jaitley, the former Defence Minister, Finance Minister of India, has passed away today. I cannot believe that I am so far away and one of my friends is gone.


      I am in a lot of agony, pain and sorrow. A few days ago our former External Affairs Minister Sister Sushma has left us in the same month, and today my friend Arun is no more. This is a very tough time for me. On the one hand I am bound by duty, on the other hand, my heart cries for my loving friends; I am overwhelmed with emotions. I pay my respectful tribute to brother Arun from the land of Bahrain today and bow down to him. God bless his family in this moment of grief. I pray for him. Once again, I thank my dear brothers and sisters of Bahrain for giving me the opportunity to come here and interact with you. I express my heartfelt gratitude to you.


      Bharat Mata ki Jai!


      Bharat Mata ki Jai!


      Bharat Mata ki Jai!


      Thanks a lot!


      Namaskar to all!
