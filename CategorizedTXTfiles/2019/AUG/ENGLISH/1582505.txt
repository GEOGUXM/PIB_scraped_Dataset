    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:


         1. Crude oil production by ONGC during July, 2019 was 1731.27 TMT which is 3.30% lower than the target and 3.23% lower when compared with July, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-July, 2019 was 6867.74 TMT which is 1.27% lower than target for the period and lower by 4.37% than production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * Electrical submersible pumps (ESP) issues in wells of NBP field and Ratna R-series. Two wells put back on production through rig intervention. Rig deployed at NBP-A well platform and rig mobilization planned for remaining wells post monsoon.

      * Increase in water cut in certain wells of Heera, Neelam and B173A fields.
      * Sub-sea leakage in some well fluid lines of MH and NH Asset leading to flow restriction.

         1. Crude oil production by OIL during July, 2019 was 273.82 TMT which is 4.83% lower than monthly target and 4.65% lower when compared with July, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-July, 2019 was 1080.44 TMT which is 4.08% lower than target for the period and 3.97% lower than production during the corresponding period of last year. Major reason for lower production is less than planned contribution from workover wells and drilling wells.


         1. Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during July, 2019 was 763.86 TMT which is 10.07% lower than the monthly target and 6.84% lower than July, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-July, 2019 was 3027.42 TMT which is 7.95% lower than target for the period and 10.88% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


    v RJ-ON-90/1 (CEIL): Deficit is from Mangla due to delay in 45 FM-1&4 (Fatehgarh-Mangla) infills ESP failure, drilling & work over activities and water leakage.


    v Operational issues in Bhagyam and Aishwarya fields.


    v CB-ONN-2005/9 (Mercator): Oil production from Jyoti-1 is stopped. Well closed for long term pressure build up study and could not be put back in production due to non-grant of EC for development campaign.


    v Jyoti-2 under workover operations.

     1. Non-grant of EC (Environment Clearance) for development campaign till date leading to delay in drilling new development well.

    Natural Gas

     1. Natural gas production during July, 2019 was 2717.92 MMSCM which is 0.16% higher when compared with July, 2018 but 5.62% lower than the monthly target. Cumulative natural gas production during April-July, 2019 was 10748.77 MMSCM which is 5.06% lower than target for the period and 0.31% lower than production during corresponding period of last year Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II. Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of July, 2019 and cumulatively for the period April-July, 2019 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

    Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production


         1. Natural gas production by ONGC during July, 2019 was 2023.37 MMSCM which is 4.52% lower than target and 1.06% lower when compared with July 2018. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC during April-July, 2019 was 8151.05 MMSCM which is 2.51% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year but 2.80% lower than the cumulative target. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


    Ø Less gas production from Bassein and Satellite Asset due to de optimization of certain wells. The wells are being attended for optimization.


    Ø Less off-take by consumers /Shut downs/ marketing issues in Cauvery, Rajahmundry, Tripura, Jodhpur and Silchar.


    Ø Pressure decline in Pasarlapudi, Kesavadasupalem & Mandapeta fields in Rajahmundry and in Kuthalam & Kali fields in Cauvery Asset.


         1. Natural gas production by OIL during July, 2019 was 235.84 MMSCM which is 2.06% higher than July, 2018 but 18.16% lower than the monthly target. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-July, 2019 was 915.73 MMSCM which is 1.70% higher than the production during the corresponding period of last year but 19.02% lower than the cumulative target. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


     1. Loss of potential in Deohal area due to presence of CO2 in production stream.

     2. Environmental loss (Bandh and miscreant activities).
     3. Namrup Plant-II shut down since 19 th May, 2019 due to disruption in process line of synthesis gas boiler outlet.

         1. Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during July, 2019 was 458.71 MMSCM which is 4.86% higher than July, 2018 but 2.94% lower than the monthly target. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-July, 2019 was 1681.99 MMSCM which is 6.78% lower than the cumulative target and 12.88% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


     1. KG-DWN-98/3 (RIL): MA field ceased production and closure of 2 wells in D1D3 field.

     2. KG-OSN-2001/3 (ONGC): Delay in anticipated production from well DDW D-5.
     3. RJ-ON/6(FEL): Production from wells DT-2, 11-W-2A, 11-W-1A & Sonara-1 reduced sharply due to high water cut and under performance of other wells OMM-1 & SGL-7.

         1. CPSE Refineries’ production during July, 2019 was 13424.02 TMT which is 0.90% higher than the target for the month and 3.98% higher when compared with July, 2018. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-July, 2019 was 47947.38 TMT which is 2.33% lower than the target for the period and 4.17% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


     1. IOCL, Guwahati: Lower due to low crude receipt.

     2. IOCL, Barauni: Lower due to Atmospheric & Vacuum Unit (AVU-3) throughput due to Heavy Vacuum Gas Oil (HVGO) pump strainer chockage.
     3. IOCL, Bongaigaon: Lower due to low crude receipt.
     4. IOCL, Paradip: Hydrogen generation unit (HGU) and Delayed Coker Unit (DCU) interruptions.

    3.2 Production in JV refineries during July, 2019 was 1609.70 TMT which is 1.37% higher than the target for the month but 3.88% lower when compared with July, 2018. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-July, 2019 was 6850.47 TMT which is 9.55% higher than the target for the period and 5.10% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year.


    3.3 Production in private refineries during July, 2019 was 6743.31 TMT which is lower by 13.82% than the target both for the month and corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-July, 2019 was 29562.75 TMT which is lower by 0.85% than the target and corresponding period of last year. Major reason for lower production is due to One CDU of RIL’s DTA refinery was under planned shutdown for 23 days in July 2019.


    3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of July, 2019 and cumulatively for the period April-July, 2019 vis-à-vis April-July, 2018 are given at Annexures - IV and V respectively.
