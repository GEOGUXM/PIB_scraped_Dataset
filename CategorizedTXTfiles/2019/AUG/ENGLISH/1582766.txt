    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind in his message on the eve of Janmashtami has said :-


    “On the joyous occasion of Janmashtami, I convey my warm greetings and best wishes to all my fellow citizens in India and abroad.


    Yogeshwar Krishna embodied righteousness against evil and devotion to truthfulness. He taught us to focus on ‘ Nishkam Karma’ i.e. responsibility rather than reward. Janmashtami is a day to commit ourselves to the life and teachings of Shree Krishna.


    Let us resolve to imbibe these timeless and universal values and follow them for the betterment of our lives and the world”.
