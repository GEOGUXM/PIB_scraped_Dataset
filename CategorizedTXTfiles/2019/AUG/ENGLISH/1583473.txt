      Posted On: 29 AUG 2019 4:44PM by PIB Delhi


    It is observed that sections of the Media have taken a quote of Union Minister Shri Prakash Javadekar out of context. The quote in question was given by the Minister during the presentation of National Awards for Community Radio on 28.8.19, wherein he was highlighting the power of Communication and importance of Community Radio.


    At the same event, the Minister also launched “Jan Connect”, a booklet highlighting the key decisions taken by the Government in the first 75 days of its second term. Speaking about the same, he talked about several key decisions, including the landmark decision of abrogation of Article 370.


    In this context, Shri Javadekar said that “Sections of Media have unnecessarily attempted to link the situation in Jammu & Kashmir region with my comments about the significance of Community Radio and Communication in general, which amounts to irresponsible and unethical journalism.”
