    Raksha Rajya Mantri Shri Shripad Naik today encouraged children to take inspiration from Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in taking India to newer heights. Raksha Rajya Mantri was addressing 3,500 children from 41 government schools, who will display 'Naya Bharat', as well as 700 NCC cadets who will participate in the Independence Day celebrations at the majestic Red Fort here on August 15, 2019. Shri Shripad Naik called upon the students to imbibe the virtues which will be shared by the Prime Minister during his Independence Day address.


    Raksha Rajya Mantri also lauded the children for their determination by sitting for long hours for the last few days in challenging weather in the run up to the celebrations. Therefore, it gives me immense pleasure to give you mementos for your hard work, he added.


    Later, Raksha Rajya Mantri gave away souvenirs to one teacher & one student from each participating school and Unit-in-Charge of the NCC group and a cadet on behalf of all participating children/cadets.
