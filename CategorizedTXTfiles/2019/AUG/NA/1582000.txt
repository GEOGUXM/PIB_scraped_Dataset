    Shri Rajnath Singh said there has been unease in Pakistan following the recent government decision to nullify Article 370 and create Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. However, the neighbouring country has no courage to take on us because it is very well aware of the strength and capabilities of the Indian Armed Forces, he added.
