    Indian Overseas Bank has set up “ Bank on Wheels ” facility (mobile ATM & digital banking) at Devarajaswamy Perumal Temple, Kancheepuram.


    The Bank on Wheels vehicles are stationed at East Gopuram Entrance and another near West Gopuram Entrance enabling the devotees to use the facility and withdraw, transfer or make any money related transactions during the festival. The public has welcomed the Bank on Wheels facility as it helps them to withdraw money at ease.


    Bank on Wheels service by Indian Overseas bank aims to benefit large number of devotees thronging to Devaraja Perumal Swamy temple for the Athi Varadar Festival at Kancheepuram . An added advantage on using Bank on Wheels is that a dedicated Banking correspondent will accompany the vehicle with a micro ATM inside the Van to take care of all banking services not restricting the facility to be a money vending machine alone. The banking correspondent will also assist with various services like instant Account opening, enrollment of customers in Social Security Scheme, Passbook Printing and other Financial inclusion activities.


    Bank on Wheels service commenced on 03 rd August 2019 and has received overwhelming response from the public. This facility will be available for the public and devotees at Devarajaswamy Perumal Temple, Kancheepuram until 17th August 2019, according to the press release issued by the Indian Overseas Bank, Chennai.
