    The termination of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) by the US in the first week of June does not seem to have an "overly negative impact" on Indian engineering exports to the world's largest economy, though the trend would be clearer only in the next few months, an EEPC India analysis has shown.


    Unlike most of the global markets, engineering exports to the US remained in the positive territory both for June and the first quarter of the current fiscal.


    " Though our engineering exports to the US went up to USD 990.5 million in June, 2019 from USD 913 million in the same month of 2018 , registering a growth of 8.5 per cent, we have got to be watchful whether and how the withdrawal of the GSP by the US is panning out, " said the EEPC India Chairman Mr Ravi Sehgal.


    For the cumulative three-month period of the current fiscal ending June, the shipments of engineering goods to the US went up to USD 2.92 billion , showing a growth of 5.2 per cent year on year from USD 2.78 billion in the April-June period of 2018-19.


    However, contrary to this trend, India's overall engineering exports during June , 2019 fell by 2.31 per cent to USD 6.36 billion from USD 6.51 billion while for the April-June period the decline was by 1.85 per cent to USD 20 billion from USD 20.04 billion .
