    A research team from IIT Kharagpur has adapted a process called Hydro Thermal Carbonization (HTC) for the Indian conditions which can effectively manage mixed Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) with high moisture content. Through the process most of the mixed MSW can be converted into biofuel, soil amendmentand absorbents.


    This particular technology converts organic fraction of MSW intohydrochar by using a batch reactor. The moisture in the waste is used to the advantage of the process which uses water for the reaction. The process has increased the resource recovery yield to 50-65% of urban organic waste. The key to the success of the technology lies in designing proper industrial scale HTC reactor with improved heat integration system.


    Another novelty of this technology is the zero waste scale is reached through this process. The biofuel generated as the recovered output is comparable to lignite coal thus significantly addressing the fossil fuel depletion issue and helping curb air pollution issues. The product can further be used as an absorbent to manage soil contamination.


    The technology can be deployed by municipalities at various locations within a city thus ensuring easy management of logistics of waste. Thermal based Waste-to-Energy plants in India have a capacity to process 5,300 tons of garbage and produce 53.5 MW/day. There is a big market on waste treatment and this technology can serve well for the organic fraction of municipal solid waste.
