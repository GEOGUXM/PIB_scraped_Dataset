    The Indian Coast Guard successfully handed over 516 fishermen alongwith 32 Indian fishing boats to the West Bengal State Fisheries authorities at Kakdwip fishing harbour post repatriation from Bangladesh on 17 Jul 2019.


    The fishing boats had strayed in Bangladesh waters due to rough seas & strong currents on 06/07 Jul 19. They had been provided with shelter at Payra Port by the Bangladesh Coast Guard. They were also provided food, fresh water & fuel to reach back to India. The boats were sailed on 16 Jul 19 under escort of Bangladesh Coast Guard ships upto IMBL (International Maritime Boundary Line) for repatriation, where they were taken over by the Indian Coast Guard ships Vijaya and Anmol.


    Ensuring safe arrival of the fishermen back home and uniting them with their families despite rough sea & strong winds is yet another shot in the arm of the Indian Coast Guard and their resolve to stick to their motto “Vayam Rakshamah”.


    Search for remaining 24 missing Indian fishermen is in progress by Bangladesh Coast Guard /Naval ships/aircraft in Bangladesh Waters. Besides search across IMBL in Bangladesh waters, Indian Coast Guard ships, hovercraft and aircraft are also carrying out search off West Bengal Coast and along the IMBL.
