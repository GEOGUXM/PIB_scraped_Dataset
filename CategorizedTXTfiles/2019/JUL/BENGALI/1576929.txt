    EEPC India, sponsored by Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry, has opened its Jamshedpur Chapter in Jharkhand today. In order to reach out to the engineering exporters in Tier Two and Tier Three cities, EEPC India will start 14 more such nodal chapters in different parts of the country in the coming days. EEPC India, currently operating with 10 Offices in 8 cities and over 13,000 members is in an expansion mode through regional ‘Chapters’, to service the engineering sector which is spread across various parts of the country. Many of the industry segments are located in smaller towns (tier II/III cities) where local EEPC India offices are not present. In these places, the engineering exporters find it difficult to avail EEPC India’s services.


    The Steel City – Jamshedpur which is also home to the first private iron and steel company of India is the Headquarters of the East Singhbhum district of Jharkhand and rich in minerals, including iron ore, coal, manganese bauxite and lime. Jamshedpur is the Industrial Capital of Jharkhand endowed with modern, industries in iron and steel, truck manufacturing, tinplate production, cement and other small and medium scale industries revolving around these products – Mr B D Agarwal, Regional Chairman (ER), EEPC India said at the inaugural event today. Mr Inder Kumar Agarwal would be the Convener of the Jamshedpur (Jharkhand) Chapter, EEPC India.
