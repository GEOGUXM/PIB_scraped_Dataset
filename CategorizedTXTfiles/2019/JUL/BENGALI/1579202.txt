    The 129 th Edition of the Durand Cup is being held in Kolkata from 02 to 24 August 2019. In the three week long tournament, matches will be played at various venues in and around Kolkata. Sixteen participating teams from across the country, including four teams from the Services, are set to play the matches to win the coveted trophies. The winning team will be presented with three trophies i.e. The President’s Cup (first presented by Dr Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India), the Durand Cup (the original challenge prize, which is a rolling trophy) and the Shimla Trophy (first presented by citizens of Shimla in 1904 and since 1965, a rolling trophy). This year the tournament has been shifted from its homeland Delhi to Kolkatafor this edition.


    The 129th edition of the cup is being organized under the patronage of the Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee and the three service Chiefs from Army, Navy and Air Force. Lt Gen MM Naravane, GOC-in-C, Eastern Command, Department of Youth Services and Sports, Government of West Bengal, AIFF (All India Football Federation) and IFA (West Bengal) are extending support to make this tournament a success.


    Notably, the tournament that began as an Army Cup, was a conscious way to maintain health and fitness initially among the British troops but later opened to civilians and currently is one of the leading sporting event. Royal Scouts Fusiliers won the inaugural edition of the Durand Cup way back in 1888. Mohammedan Sporting Club was the first Indian club to win the cup, in 1940, when the tournament shifted to Delhi. Mohun Bagan and East Bengal are the most successful teams in the history of the Durand Cup, winning it on 16 occasions each. The “Army Greens” are the current defending champions, winning the last tournament played in 2016.
