    An outreach programme was organised by the TDS wing of Income Tax Department at Wilson College, Chowpatty, Mumbai on the occasion of 159th Income Tax Day celebrations i.e. Aaykar Diwas on 24th July, 2019. It was on 24th July, 1860 that Income Tax was introduced for the first time in India by Sir James Wilson to compensate for the losses incurred by the British regime during the first war of independence against British rule. This is why 24th July is observed as the Income Tax Day.


    The programme was attended by the students and the members of the faculty and principal of the Wilson College, Mumbai. The programme was inaugurated by Shri Pratap Singh IRS, Commissioner of Income Tax (TDS), Mumbai. He explained to the students about the importance of income tax for nation building, why people should pay income tax and what happens if a person does not pay income tax. He exhorted the students to promote payment of taxes as a value and for sensitizing potential tax payers that payment of taxes was an ethical duty of all citizens.


    A presentation was also made on role and importance of Income Tax department in nation building. The programme was also attended by Shri Abdul Hakeem IRS and Shri Suman Kumar IRS, Joint Commissioners of Income Tax (TDS) and other officers and staff of the department. The students participated in the programme enthusiastically by raising many questions which were answered by Shri Pratap Singh, Commissioner of Income tax (TDS), Mumbai. The programme ended with the national anthem.
