      Posted On: 02 JUL 2019 11:51AM by PIB Chennai


    Shri. V. Raju , Chief General Manager, BSNL, Tamilnadu Circle said in a statement, that, Some false reports on BSNL have appeared in some sections of media, These reports are initiated by some vested interests with ulterior motives. Therefore it has become necessary to give clarification and remove any doubts in the minds of the general public.


    There is no proposal to close down BSNL as wrongly reported in a section of the press. Due to stiff competition and the lowering of tariff, BSNL is facing a funds crisis for the last few months. However, Government of India is actively preparing a revival plan for BSNL for the approval by the Cabinet.


    BSNL is a Public Sector company wholly owned by the Government of India. BSNL is rendering telecom services in extremist-affected areas, remote areas and also for the defence forces. Hon’ble Telecom Minister Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad has conveyed in Lok Sabha that BSNL is needed by the country as a strategic telecom service provider. He has also pointed out that BSNL is the only telecom operator providing services to the public even at times of natural calamities such as cyclone, floods, etc.


    In view of these facts, all the general public are hereby informed that BSNL will continue to serve the public for years to come and will continue to provide the best telecom services at the cheapest tariff in a transparent manner. We request the general public not to believe any rumours in this regard.
