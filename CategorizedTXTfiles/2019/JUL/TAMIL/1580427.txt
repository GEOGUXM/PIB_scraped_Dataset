      Posted On: 26 JUL 2019 4:31PM by PIB Chennai


    Department of Posts has been organizing various activities to mark the 150 th Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. The celebrations started with release of a set of seven Circular Postage Stamps on 2 nd October 2018. Around 25 countries across the globe have also released Stamps to commemorate the 150 th Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.


    Gandhiji had visited Tamil Nadu many times between 1896 and 1946. His first footprint was set in Tamil Nadu when he visited Chennai during April ’1896. Further, he had visited Tarangambadi (1915), Tiruchirappali (1919), Madurai (1921), Kanniyakumari (1925), Rajapalayam (1927), Tirupur (1934), Coimbatore (1934), Udagamandalam (1934), Salem (1934) and Chennai (1946) as a part of some historic events of his life.


    Tamilnadu Postal Circle is pleased to highlight the importance of the historic visits of Gandhiji by releasing the Interlinked Carried Special Covers and Special Cancellations at 11 different places between 26.07.2019 and 02.08.2019, as a part of his 150 th anniversary celebrations.


    The significance of these Special covers is that they are made of handmade papers and are getting carried to the subsequent places of release by Shri K. Mohan, Chairman, Gandhi Study Centre, Chennai.


    The themes, dates and places of release of the Special Covers and Special Cancellations are as below:
