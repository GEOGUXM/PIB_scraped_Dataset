      Posted On: 08 JUL 2019 5:59PM by PIB Chennai


      The Jammu and Kashmir circle of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) has made special arrangement to provide smooth connectivity for communication requirements of yatris undertaking the pilgrimage to holy Amarnath cave shrine in south Kashmir Himalayas, from 01.07.2019 to 15.08.2019.


      Since prepaid connections of other states are not allowed to work in J&K, special pre-loaded Yatra SIMs are being provided by BSNL with the approval of Ministry of Home Affairs /DOT . The cost of the Yatra SIMs is Rs.230/-(including the cost of STV and Plan Voucher) with 20,000 sec free talk time and 1.5 GB free data usage and validity of ten days. Since large number of pilgrims is expected, voice and SMS have given priority over data.


      For obtaining the BSNL pre-loaded Yatra SIM card, valid documents such as Proof of Address, Proof of Identity and applicant's photograph are required to be submitted by the Yatries along with a photo copy of counter foil of Registration Slip issued by SASB which shall be considered as local reference.
