      Private Insurance Companies in Ayushman Bharat
      Posted On: 16 JUL 2019 4:34PM by PIB Delhi


    Under Ayushman Bharat â€“ Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY), states have the flexibility to choose the mode of implementation. They can either implement it in insurance mode, or through a trust or in a mixed mode i.e. both the insurance and trust mode. The States implementing scheme through Insurance mode select Insurance Company through open tendering process. The private insurance companies are allowed to bid in the open tendering process to allow level playing field. However, the decision lies with the State Government concerned and the Government has no role in the selection of Insurance company.


    Under AB-PMJAY, 1393 procedures have been laid down for treatment of beneficiaries. A statement indicating State-wise number of beneficiaries admitted for treatment and amount on account of hospitalization is given below:
