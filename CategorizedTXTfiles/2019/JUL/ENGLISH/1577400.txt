    A number of measures to further deepen bond markets have been proposed by the Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, while presenting the Union Budget 2019-20 in Parliament today.


    The Finance Minister said, “ Corporate Debt markets are crucial for the infrastructure sector. Though the number and value of bond issuances had gone up, there has been a dip in the last two years. The market is skewed in favour of private placement”.


    The Finance Minister added that given the need to further deepen bond markets, a number of measures are proposed to be taken up, which are as follows;

      * To deepen the Corporate tri-party repo market in Corporate Debt securities, Government will work with regulators RBI/SEBI to enable stock exchanges to allow AA rated bonds as collaterals.
      * User-friendliness of trading platforms for corporate bonds will be reviewed, including issues arising-out of capping of ISINs.
