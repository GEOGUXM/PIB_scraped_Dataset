      Weavers MUDRA Scheme
      Posted On: 12 JUL 2019 4:04PM by PIB Delhi


    Under the Concessional Credit/Weaver MUDRA Scheme, Margin Money assistance at 20% of loan amount subject to a maximum of Rs.10,000/- per weaver, loan at 6% interest rate and Credit Guarantee for a period of 3 years is provided to handloom weavers/weaver entrepreneurs across the country. However, the Government of India interest subvention is capped at 7%.


    For timely transfer of financial assistance, Handloom Weaver MUDRA Portal has been developed in association with Punjab National Bank to cut down delay in disbursement of funds for margin money and interest subvention. The margin money assistance is transferred directly to loan account of weaver and interest subvention is transferred to banks through the portal.


    The handloom weavers submit their loan applications as per their requirement to participating banks and the Weaversâ€™ Service Centres/State Governments sponsor their loan applications to the participating banks for sanction of loans. Thereafter, the banks sanction loan to the weavers keeping in view the viability of their loan proposals.


    This information was given by the Union Minister of Textiles, Smriti Zubin Irani, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
