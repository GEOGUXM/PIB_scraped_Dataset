      Misuse of ISI Mark
      Posted On: 16 JUL 2019 4:05PM by PIB Delhi


      From time to time BIS receives complaints on misuse of ISI mark. On receipt of such complaints, investigations followed by raids are carried out. Thereafter, prosecution is launched against the offender(s) in the Court of law having jurisdiction over the matter. For launching prosecution regarding the misuse of ISI mark, testing of the sample of the product is not required.


      State wise number of search and seizure operations carried out during last four years is at Annexure.


      Scheme-I is the Conformity Assessment scheme for Grant of licence to use or apply Standard Mark (ISI) on goods and articles as per Indian Standard. This scheme is governed by the provisions of BIS (Conformity Assessment) Regulations, 2018. For licences so granted, performance is assessed through factory surveillance at periodic intervals. During the surveillance, Product samples may also be drawn and sent to third party laboratory for checking conformance to relevant standard. In addition, samples of the product bearing BIS standard mark are also purchased from the market and got tested at third party laboratory for checking conformance to relevant standard.


      Based on the non-conformance if any, observed from the test report, actions are initiated against manufacturer, depending on frequency of failure and considering performance of licence previously.


      During the last four years, number of licences cancelled because of failure of sample in testing were as under:
