      Posted On: 18 JUL 2019 3:09PM by PIB Delhi


    Suggestions have been received for optimal utilization of the Central Deputation Reserve of All India Services officers in various States so as to meet the requirement of officers at the Centre. The two-way movement of officers benefits both the States and the Centre. While meeting the need for fresh inputs from diverse States at senior levels at the Centre in policy planning/formulation and implementation of programmes in States, such action also enhances the domain expertise of individual officer and widens their experience.


    It may be added that the officers are required to have worked on central deputation for a minimum period of three years at the level of Deputy Secretary and above for consideration of empanelment as Secretary and Additional Secretary.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
