      Disposal of Garbage
      Posted On: 09 JUL 2019 6:10PM by PIB Delhi


    As per the information shared by Department of Drinking Water & Sanitation, Ministry of Jal Shakti, Solid Waste Management is one of the integral components of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) [(SBM(G)]. The activities like collection, segregation and safe disposal of household garbage and safe disposal solutions for menstrual west (used sanitary cloths and pads) and collection mechanisms, etc. can be taken up under this component. States have the flexibility to decide the technologies suitable to their local conditions and needs. SBM(G) guidelines provide for adoption of technologies related to maximum reuse of organic solid waste as manure such as vermi-composting/any other composting method, individual and community biogas plants, etc., and Gram Panchayats may create forward linkages with Blocks/Districts/private agencies where treatment of waste within the village is not possible.


    As per the information shared by Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, management of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is a State subject. Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban(SBM-U) encourages Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to manage their garbage in scientific manner as prescribed under Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.


    As reported by the ULBs/State Governments, the details of waste processing plants in the country are as under:
