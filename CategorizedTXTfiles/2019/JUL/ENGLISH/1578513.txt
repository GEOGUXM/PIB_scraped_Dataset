      Re-Registration of Medical Professionals
      Posted On: 12 JUL 2019 3:31PM by PIB Delhi


    As on date, the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 does not provide for re-registration of doctors. Medical Council of India (MCI), with the previous approval of the Central Government, has notified Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002, which, inter-alia, prescribe that a Physician should participate in professional meetings as a part of Continuing Medical Education (CME). In order to enhance professional skills and to update their medical knowledge, such CMEs must be attended by medical practitioners for at least 30 hours every 5 years, organized by reputed professional academic bodies or any other authorized organizations. Further, no such data is maintained centrally with regard to the medical practitioners who have not submitted information about their participation in professional meetings as a part of CME.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
