      Grievance Redressal Under PDS
      Posted On: 23 JUL 2019 3:31PM by PIB Delhi


    Department of Food & Public Distribution has launched a new scheme namely “Integrated Management of Public Distribution System (IM-PDS)” for implementation during 2018-19 and 2019-20. The main objective of the scheme is to introduce nation-wide portability of ration card holders under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA), to lift their entitlement foodgrains from any FPS in the country without the need to obtain a new ration card, by integrating the existing PDS systems/portals of States/UTs with the Central systems/portals, etc. Keeping in view the physical progress under ongoing schemes and readiness for implementation of National Portability in few States, it has been decided to implement the National Portability on a pilot basis in two clusters i.e. Andhra Pradesh & Telangana (Cluster-I) and Gujarat & Maharashtra (Cluster-II) w.e.f. August 1, 2019.


    Department of Food and Public Distribution in collaboration with States/UTs is implementing a scheme on ‘End-to-End Computerization of TPDS Operations’ to improve the efficiency and transparency in Public Distribution System (PDS) operations. The scheme comprises digitization of ration cards/beneficiary and other databases, online allocation, computerization of supply-chain management, setting up of transparency portal and grievance redressal mechanisms. Under the scheme online grievance redressal facility/Toll-free (1967/1800-series) number has been implemented in all States/UTs.


    A statement showing the total number of ration cards issued, Fair Price Shops operational and other corrective measures taken (State/UT wise) is at annexure.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri Danve Raosaheb Dadarao in the Lok Sabha today.
