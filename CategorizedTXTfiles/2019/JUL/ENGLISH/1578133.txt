      Approval for Eateries and Kirana Shops
      Posted On: 10 JUL 2019 4:42PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government of India is considering to significantly cut down the number of approvals required for eateries and kirana shops. It has undertaken several reform measures to cut down number of approvals required to set up a business.


    A representation has been received from National Restaurant Association of India regarding introduction of a single window clearance system for opening/running a restaurant. Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), through the State Reforms Action Plan, encourages States and Union Territories (UTs) to implement an online application system to fast track granting of approval and renewal under the Shops and Establishment Act of respective States which includes restaurant industry as well. The system should have the following features:


    i. Online submission of application without the need to submit physical copy of application.


    ii. Eliminate physical touchpoint for document submission.


    iii. Allow option of online payment of application fee.


    iv. Allow applicant to track status of application online.


    v. Ensure that applicant can download the final certificate online.


    Various approvals/clearances/licenses, at the level of Centre as well as at the State level, are required for setting up of eateries and kirana shops depending on the nature of shop.


    This information was given by the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
