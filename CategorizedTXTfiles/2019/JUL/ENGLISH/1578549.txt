    Government of India through National Jute board (NJB) has given two projects to IIT Kharagpur and IJIRA towards the use of jute as raw material for the production of sanitary napkin as substitution of imported wood pulp. Sanitary napkins are classified as medical product and the companies manufacturing it are required to adhere to the standard IS 5405 (1980). The details of imports of wood pulp from China and USA is at Annexure-A. Increased use of jute pulp in sanitary napkins will increase income of jute farmers and woman engaged in jute sector by increasing their employability which will ultimately boost the Indian economy.
