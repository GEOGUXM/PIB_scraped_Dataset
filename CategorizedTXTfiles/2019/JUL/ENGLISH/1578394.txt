    Government of India does not notify Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) areas as such. However, Scheduled Areas are declared under Fifth Schedule of the Constitution of India as per Article 244(1) of the Constitution. Apart from it, Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP) / Integrated Tribal Development Agencies (ITDA), Modified Area Development Agency (MADA) and Clusters are also declared by the Government on the basis of proposals received from State Government/Union Territory Administration.


    This information was given by Union Minister of Tribal Affairs Shri Arjun Munda in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
