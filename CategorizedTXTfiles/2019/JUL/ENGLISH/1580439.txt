      Growth of Fisheries Sector
      Posted On: 26 JUL 2019 5:05PM by PIB Delhi


    The potential of marine fishery resources available in our jurisdictional waters is estimated as 5.31 million metric tonnes. Against this potential, the production from marine fisheries in 2018-19 has been estimated as 3.714 million metric tonnes (provisional). This indicates that marine fisheries resources are not overexploited and there is a marginal scope for tapping of more resources from the sea in a sustainable manner.


    This Department of Fisheries, Government of India is implementing a component namely, ‘Development of Marine Fisheries, Infrastructure and Post Harvest Operations’ under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme ‘Blue Revolution: Integrated Development and Management of Fisheries’, under which central financial assistance is provided to the States/Union Territories for growth and development of fisheries sector in the country for sub-components like motorizations of traditional crafts, procurement of Fiber-glass Reinforced Plastic (FRP) boats, construction of resource specific fishing vessels, mariculture activities, creating of shore based infrastructure facilities like fish landing centres, ice plants, cold storages, fish markets etc. Besides, the Department is issuing advisories to all maritime States and Union Territories for observing sustainable fisheries with appropriate conservation and fishery management measures.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Shri Pratap Chandra Sarangi in Rajya Sabha today.
