      Posted On: 19 JUL 2019 5:45PM by PIB Delhi


    PMKVY 2016-20 does not mandate the establishment of skill development centres; however, it enables large number of prospective youth for taking up Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) through accredited and affiliated training centers (TCs) throughout the country. Under the scheme, for imparting the skill training, the accreditation and affiliation of TCs are being done under single window IT application known as SMART (Skill Management and Accreditation of Training Centres). As on 12.06.2019, there are 12,127 empanelled TCs under STT component of PMKVY 2016-20 across the country. The State/UT – wise details are given at Annexure .


    Under PMKVY 2016-20, all the trainers are certified by Sector Skill Councils (SSCs). At the time of accreditation and affiliation, ‘SSC certified trainer (s) at TC’ for respective job role is a mandatory eligibility criterion. The training process starts only after the successful accreditation and affiliation of TC.


    There is no fixed number of the trainers in a TC under the scheme, though it depends upon the job roles for which TC is accredited and affiliated. The number of trainers for a specific job role in a TC is decided by the respective SSC.


    Further, in order to maintain records of certified trainers, a dedicated portal called ‘Takshashila’, has been developed. The portal also provides access to the Training of Trainers (ToT) guidelines, notifications on upcoming ToT programs and Eligibility criteria for Trainers (and assessors). As on 15.07.2019, 18,443 certificates have been issued by concerned SSCs to respective trainers.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri. R. K. Singh in the Rajya Sabha today.
