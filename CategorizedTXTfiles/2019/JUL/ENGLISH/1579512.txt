      Posted On: 19 JUL 2019 5:10PM by PIB Delhi


    The Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao (BBBP) Scheme is being implemented in all 640 districts (as per census 2011) of the country since 8th March, 2018. Out of these, 405 districts are covered through Multi-Sectoral Intervention, Media & Advocacy, while remaining 235 districts are covered under Advocacy & Media Campaign only.


    The funds are being released to these 405 districts by Ministry of Women and Child Development to implement the multi-sectoral and district level activities viz. inter-sectoral consultation, meetings of district task force, block level committees, innovation and outreach, information education and communication materials, awareness kit to anganwadi centers, monitoring, evaluation and documentation of the scheme and health and education related activities.


    The Multi-Sectoral Intervention and Media & Advocacy campaign of BBBP have been structured for greater coverage and reach in the country to increase the productivity of the scheme. BBBP Scheme is beginning to generate people's consciousness in the country towards valuing girl child. To sensitize the masses and for changing mindset, nation-wide media campaign is being implemented which among others include radio spots/jingles in Hindi and regional languages, video spots, SMS campaigns, community engagement through song & drama, e-mailers, handouts, brochures and other information, education and communication material has been adopted which includes social media platforms.


    The BBBP scheme has no provision for individual cash incentive/cash transfer component and thus is not a Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme.


    This information was given by the Minister of Women and Child Development, Smriti Zubin Irani, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
