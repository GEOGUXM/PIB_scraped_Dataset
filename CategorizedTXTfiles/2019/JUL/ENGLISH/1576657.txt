Incidents  Deaths  Incidents  Deaths                 Incidents  Deaths  Incidents  Deaths
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
323        85      251        56                     205        43      82         21    
                                                                                         
                                                                                         

    To combat the LWE menace in a holistic manner, Government of India formulated a National Policy and Action Plan in January 2015, which envisages a multi pronged approach comprising security measures, development measures, ensuring Rights and Entitlements of local communities etc.


    MHA is supporting the State Governments extensively by way of deployment of CAPF Battalions, provision of helicopter and UAVs and sanction of India Reserve Bns (IRBs)/Special India Reserve Bns (SIRBs) etc. Funds are provided under Modernisation of Police Force (MPF), Security Related Expenditure (SRE) Scheme and Special Infrastructure Scheme (SIS) for capacity building of State Police, intelligence agencies and Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs).


    Development interventions are made through provision of resources and focused implementation of schemes through line Ministries of the Govt. of India. Significant efforts have been made for improving infrastructure in LWE affected areas. These include construction of around 11000 km of roads in LWE areas. Of this, 5500 km of roads have already been constructed. For improving telecom connectivity 2335 mobile towers have been installed and 4072 mobile towers will be installed in the next phase of the project.


    To provide further impetus to development and fill critical infrastructure gaps, in the most affected LWE districts, funds are provided to the State Governments under “Special Central Assistance Scheme” @ Rs.33.33 crore per annum.


    The steadfast implementation of the policy has resulted in consistent decline in LWE violence and geographical spread. Violent incidents have declined from a high of 2258 in 2009 to 833 in 2018 in the Country. The resultant deaths have also declined steadily from 1005 in 2010 to 240 in 2018. The reduction in geographical spread of Left Wing Extremism is evident in decline in number of districts reporting LWE violence to 60 in 2018.


    The Government has taken steps to enhance sharing of intelligence and improving coordination between the agencies concerned.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G. Kishan Reddy in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.
