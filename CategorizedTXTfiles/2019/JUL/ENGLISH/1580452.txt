      Deaths due to Malnutrition
      Posted On: 26 JUL 2019 5:26PM by PIB Delhi


    The data on nutritional indicators of women and children across the country is captured under the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The State-wise prevalence of malnutrition in women and children as per NFHS - 4 (2015-16) is Annexed . Further, as far as NFHS-4 52.1% children under 5 years age are underweight and 49.3% are stunted and 31.3% are wasted. Further, 37.5% women (age 15-49 years) have chronic energy deficiency (BMI less than 18.5) among the tribal population of Rajasthan.


    Malnutrition is not a direct cause of death among children under five years of age; however, it can increase morbidity and mortality by reducing resistance to infections. Malnourished children are more vulnerable to any infection than normal children, therefore, data regarding child mortality due to malnutrition is not maintained by this Ministry. The overall child mortality rate as per NFHS- 4 is 9.4 which is declined from 18.4 as per previous NFHS- 3.


    As per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) â€“ 4 (2015-16), conducted by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 35.7% children under 5 years of age are underweight and 38.4% are stunted and 21% are wasted. The State-wise detail including Maharashtra is Annexed . Further, as per NFHS-4, 34.6% children under 5 years of age are underweight and 25.4 % are stunted and 24.1% are wasted in SolapurDistrict of Maharashtra.


    As mentioned above, malnutrition is not a direct cause of death among children under five years of age; however, it can increase morbidity and mortality by reducing resistance to infections. Malnourished children are more vulnerable to any infection than normal children. However, for monitoring the level of malnutrition among the children (0-6 years of age), recently POSHAN Abhiyaan has been launched under which near real time monitoring is done through ICDS-CAS Mobile based Software Application. The ICDS-CAS Application enables the identification of malnutrition children based on auto-plotting of Growth Charts. The drill-down dashboard available at National, State, District, Block level contributes towards identifying and addressing the problem of nutrition.
