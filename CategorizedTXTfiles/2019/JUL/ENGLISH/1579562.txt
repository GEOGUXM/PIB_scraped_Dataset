    Even though ‘Police’ is a State subject under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India and as such prevention and combating of the crime including crime against children is the responsibility of State Governments, the Government of India has been supplementing the efforts of the State Governments through various measures to combat trafficking in children for labour, sexual and other form of exploitation .


    The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has provided financial assistance to all States for setting up Anti Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs) and so far 332 such units have been set up in various districts of the country. MHA also provides financial assistance to the States and Judicial Academies in States to hold ‘Judicial Colloquiums’ and ‘State level conferences’ to sensitize police officials, judicial officers and prosecutors about various provisions of law relevant to trafficking and their role in curbing trafficking. Meetings of Nodal Officers of Anti Human Trafficking Units of States & UTs are also convened on periodic basis to sensitize them on human trafficking issues. MHA has also issued various advisories to the States and UTs from time to time on preventing and combating human trafficking. These advisories are available at MHA’s website: www.mha.gov.in.


    For prevention of trafficking and rescue, rehabilitation, re-integration and repatriation of victims of trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation, the Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing the ‘Ujjawala Scheme’. Under the scheme, at present, there are 254 projects including 134 Protective and Rehabilitative Homes in the country. In these homes, the victims of human trafficking are also provided vocational training.


    Further, in order to comprehensively address the various aspects of trafficking of persons including trafficking of children, a legislation in the form of ‘The Trafficking of Persons (Prevention, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2018’ was drafted by Ministry of Women & Child Development.


    The budget allocation and expenditure of Ujjawala Scheme for the last three years and current year are as under:
