      Posted On: 19 JUL 2019 5:55PM by PIB Delhi


    At present, a total of 75 jute mills are functioning in the country. The details of their production along with State of operation is at Annexure-I.


    The details of textile products exported during each of the last three years and current year along with details of foreign exchange earned through it, industry/country wise is at Annexure-II.


    The National Jute Board (NJB) under Ministry of Textiles has been implementing schemes for modernization of jute industry. The scheme has been instrumental in bringing new investment to the industry. The Incentive Scheme for Acquisition of Plant & Machinery (ISAPM) scheme has been launched in 2013 with an incentive @20% of the cost of machineries to Jute mills and 30% to the MSME –JDP units. During 2014-15 to 2018-19, capital subsidy amounting to Rs. 4971.19 lakhs to jute mills and JDP units has been released.


    Whenever the market price of raw jute falls below a certain level, the Jute Corporation of India (JCI) procures raw jute at Minimum Support Price (MSP), fixed on the basis of recommendation of the Commission for Agricultural Cost and Prices (CACP) from jute growers to safeguard their interest. CACP takes the view of all the stakeholders and factor in all the contributors catering to inflation, before giving the recommendation of MSP for every year. Besides, the other schemes implemented by Government for upliftment of jute sector are at Annexure-III.
