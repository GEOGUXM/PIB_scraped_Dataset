    The Government of India is supporting States/UTs for the implementation of Menstrual Hygiene Scheme for Adolescent Girls (aged 10 â€“ 19) as per proposal received from the States/UTs in their Program Implementation Plans.


    The scheme encompasses the following:

      * Increasing awareness among adolescent girls on menstrual hygiene

      * Improving access to and use of high quality sanitary napkins by adolescent girls residing primarily in rural areas.


      * Ensuring safe disposal of sanitary napkins in an environmentally friendly manner


      * Provision of funds to ASHAs to hold monthly meetings with adolescents to discuss issues related to menstrual hygiene.


    A range of IEC material has been developed around maintenance of good menstrual health, using 360 degree approach to create awareness among adolescent girls about safe and hygienic menstrual health practices which includes audio, video and reading materials for adolescent girls and job-aids for ASHAs and other field level functionaries for communicating with adolescent girls.


    There is no provision for free distribution of sanitary napkins under the Scheme. Adolescent girls are provided sanitary napkins at a subsidized rate through the ASHAs


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha, here today.
