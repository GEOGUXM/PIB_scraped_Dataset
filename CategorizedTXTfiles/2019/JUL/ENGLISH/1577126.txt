    NOTE : The funding pattern proposed is 60:40 between Centre: State Govt for all States excepting 8 states of NE Region, the hilly states of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu & Kashmir where it would be 90:10 fund sharing and 100% in case of UTs/ BTSGs (existing). If funds are released by NBM (Headquarter) directly to any Central Institution for any specific project / intervention the funding will be 100% central share.
