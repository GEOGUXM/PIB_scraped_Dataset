    The Government has been continuously taking steps to boost manufacturing and spur economic growth. It aims at creating a conducive environment by streamlining the existing regulations and processes and eliminating unnecessary requirements and procedures. ‘Make in India’ programme aims at making India a global hub for manufacturing, research and innovation and an integral part of the global supply chain. Several steps to boost domestic manufacturing are being taken as part of schemes such as ‘Startup India’, ‘Ease of Doing Business’, Modified Industrial Infrastructure Upgradation Scheme, Business Reform Action Plan and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy.
