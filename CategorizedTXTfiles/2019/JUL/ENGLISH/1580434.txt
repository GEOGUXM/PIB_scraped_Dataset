    As received from Ministry of External Affairs, the details of Indian fishermen under the custody of neighboring countries (as on 5th July, 2019) are as under:-


    1. Sri Lanka - 5 Indian fishermen


    2. Pakistan - 209 Indian and believed to be Indian fishermen


    3. Iran - 2 Indian fishermen


    Government attaches highest priority to the safety, security and welfare of Indian fishermen. The matter of apprehension of Indian fishermen and their fishing boats is raised at the highest levels and strong protests are lodged in the countries concerned. It is reiterated to the countries concerned that the fishermen issue may be considered as a purely humanitarian and livelihood concern and there should not be any use of force under any circumstances. As a result of sustained diplomatic efforts by the Government, 2004 Indian fishermen and 380 boats have been released by Sri Lanka Government since May 2014. Similarly, persistent diplomatic efforts of the Government of India have led to release and repatriation of 2080 Indian fishermen and 57 Indian fishing boats from Pakistanâ€™s custody since 2014.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Shri Pratap Chandra Sarangi in Rajya Sabha today.
