      Violation of FDI Norms
      Posted On: 10 JUL 2019 4:36PM by PIB Delhi


    Enforcement Directorate is conducting investigation in 581 cases under Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA) for alleged violation of FDI norms. Disclosure of other details of these cases may not be in large public interest as the same may adversely impact the ongoing investigations.


    It has been the endeavour of the Government to put in place an enabling and investor friendly FDI policy. The intent is to make the FDI policy more investor friendly and remove the policy bottlenecks that have been hindering investment inflows into the country. The onus of compliance with the FDI norms lies on the entity that is the recipient of FDI.


    The Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows have been going up each year, as against any of the previous years:
