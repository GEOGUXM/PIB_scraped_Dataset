    Dr Jitendra Singh recalled that during the last over five years of the Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, a number of held-up projects were cleared and executed.

He also mentioned the Sikkim being declared as the first "Organic State" of India during Prime Ministerâ€™s visit in 2016.


    Dr Jitendra Singh said Sikkim is a State blessed with rich natural potentials and in recent years, the number of tourists has multiplied manifold. It is therefore, he said, in the fitness of things to address the healthcare requirements of the State, to as much extent as possible.


    During the meeting, the Sikkim Health Minister also brought up before the DoNER Minister the demand for having a 100 bed hospital at Mangan, North Sikkim, another 100 bed hospital at Simgtem in East Sikkim and the upgradation of Pakyong Primary Health Centre. The DoNER Minister suggested to the State Health Minister to deliberate these proposals at the State Government level and then put them forward through the appropriate procedure for further feasibility, etc.
