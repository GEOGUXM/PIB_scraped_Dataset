    With an aim to promote a culture of entrepreneurship among Indiaâ€™s youth and inspire them to set-up their own enterprise and create employment opportunities for others, Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, instituted National Entrepreneurship Awards Scheme (NEAS) in 2016. Under NEAS, awards are conferred to the aspiring first generation entrepreneurs to recognize and honour their efforts and achievements and those individuals/organizations who are working as eco-system builder in the field of entrepreneurship development. The awards also seek to highlight model of excellence for others to emulate and improve upon.


    Through the Scheme, it has been attempted to make the Awards process inclusive and highlight the achievements of outstanding young entrepreneurs from different socio-economic backgrounds across sectors/ industries in varied geographies. The 3rd edition of National Entrepreneurship Awards was held in New Delhi on 4th January, 2019 which had the provision for conferring three awards (out of total 43 awards) to entrepreneurs from difficult areas.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri. R. K.Singh in the Lok Sabha today.
