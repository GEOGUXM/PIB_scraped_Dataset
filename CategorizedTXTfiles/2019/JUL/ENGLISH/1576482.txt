      Posted On: 01 JUL 2019 4:43PM by PIB Delhi


    Under the Skill India Mission, there are about 20 Central Ministries/Departments including Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) involved in the implementation of more than 40 schemes for various skill development programmes.


    Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) 2016-20 is a flagship scheme of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship being implemented with an objective to provide skilling to one crore prospective youth including persons with disability (PwD) under Short Term Training (STT) courses and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) across the country for four years i.e. 2016-2020 with an outlay of Rs. 12,000 crore. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna (PMKVY) is for all sections of the society including PwD.


    Under PMKVY 2016-20, there are incentives to encourage participation of PwDs in the skill training namely; post placement support, monthly conveyance allowance, boarding and lodging etc. Further, there is an exclusive Sector Skill Council for PwD namely Skill Council for PwD (SCPwD) for catering to the needs of the PwD candidates and run training in PwD-friendly training centres. Such centres are structurally designed to enable PwD candidates to experience beneficial training. In addition, other Training Centres can also enroll differently abled candidates. As on 12.06.2019, under STT component of PMKVY 2016-20, 26,751 PwD candidates have been trained in 984 PwD friendly training centres. The State/UT â€“ wise details are given at Annexure.


    Under PMKVY 2016-20, there is no provision of earmarking of funds exclusively for PwD candidates, hitherto funds amounting to Rs. 41.2 crore have been spent for the training of PwD candidates.


    Under PMKVY 2016-20, training is being imparted through accredited and affiliated Training Centres which can be a private entity, NGO, etc. For ensuring quality of training under the scheme, all accreditation and affiliation of training centres are done through an online portal SMART (Skill Management and Accreditation of Training Centres) with inspections done by an independent third party assessment agency.


    The guidelines for PMKVY 2016-20 have provisions relating to continuous performance monitoring of training centres. Adding to the improved accreditation process, MSDE has initiated a process of continuous monitoring through various channels and mandatory re-accreditation every year. Under this, self-audit reporting, call validations, surprise visits and monitoring through the Skill Development Management System (SDMS) have been adopted. Targets are being assigned to the TCs with a provision for periodic review. Further, various IT interventions such as Direct Benefit Transfer, Aadhaar linkage of trainers and trainees, Aadhaar enabled biometric attendance of candidates and trainers, maintaining of all MIS through SDMS portal to check duplication of candidates, digilocker for issuance and verification of documents and certificate, Power-Bi tool to maintain transparency and continuous public awareness, Kaushal mart for online access to sample content, etc., have been ensured.


    Additionally, PMKVY Monitoring Committee review and formulate framework on the critical cases related to monitoring issues of the stakeholders. Also, the Committee has formulated penalty grid (approved by Steering Committee for PMKVY) for taking action against erring / non compliant training centres / stakeholders. Based on the penalty grid, National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), an implementing agency of PMKVY under MSDE, has suspended training centers for noncompliance of PMKVY 2016-20 guidelines on multiple parameters and periodically publishes the list on PMKVY official website.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri. R. K. Singh in the Lok Sabha today.
