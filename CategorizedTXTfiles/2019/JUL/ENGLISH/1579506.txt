    In order to modernize the Quality Control laboratory at Institute of Food Security (Gurugram), FCI has entered into an agreement with Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), Mysuru and modernization is being undertaken for in house testing of foodgrain samples for chemical parameters. In the FCI laboratories old Moisture Meters have been replaced with Digital Moisture Meters. Moreover Whiteness Meters and Computerised Rice Analyser has also been installed in some of the laboratories of FCI.


    During the period the laboratories of Indian Grain Storage Management and Research Institute (IGMRI) have also been upgraded with modern equipments for analysis of Pesticide Residues and My cotoxin contamination in Foodgrains stored in depots.
