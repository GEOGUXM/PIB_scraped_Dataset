    One incident of a terrorist attack on the Air Force took place on the intervening night of 01/02 January, 2016 at Air Force Station Pathankot. No Indian naval ship or establishment has been attacked during the last three years.


    While all such incidents are enquired into, the Ministry of Defence constituted a committee under Lt Gen (Retd) Philip Campose to enquire into the incident at Air Force Station Pathankot and to recommend remedial measures to strengthen security of various military establishments across the country. Based on the Committee's recommendations, various measures including strengthening of physical security through layered defence and perimeter security, deployment of Quick Reaction Teams, use of airborne platforms etc. for security of defence installations have been instituted. Periodical review of the security arrangements based on threat assessment to devise suitable measures are adopted to counter such threats.
