      Posted On: 03 JUL 2019 3:17PM by PIB Delhi


    Presently the refining capacity of the country is 249.366 Million Metric Tonne Per Annum (MMTPA). Details of Refineries along with their refining capacity are at Annexure-I. The domestic consumption of petroleum products was 211.6 MMT during 2018-19. The present refining capacity is adequate to meet the demand of petroleum products in the country.


    Oil Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) are executing/evaluating brown field and green-field refinery projects including Rajasthan Refinery project at Barmer, Rajasthan. The details of capacity expansion of refineries are at Annexure-II.


    Refinery Sector has been delicensed in 1998. Post de-licensing, any public sector or private sector entity can set up the refinery depending upon techno commercial viability of the project.


    This Information was given by the Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Shri Dharmendra Pradhan in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
