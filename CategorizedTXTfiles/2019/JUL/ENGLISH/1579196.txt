      Posted On: 17 JUL 2019 5:42PM by PIB Delhi


    Ministry of Home Affairs makes every endeavour to accord security clearance to cases of foreign direct investment (FDI) expeditiously. The average time taken for clearance of such proposals has reduced significantly from about four months in 2014 to about two months in 2019. Only seven cases of FDI are presently under the consideration of Ministry of Home Affairs and no case is pending beyond prescribed time limit.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G. Kishan Reddy in a written reply to question in the Rajya Sabha today.
