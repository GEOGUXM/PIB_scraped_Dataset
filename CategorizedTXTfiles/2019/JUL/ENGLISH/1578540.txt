      Crisis in Jute Industry
      Posted On: 12 JUL 2019 4:12PM by PIB Delhi


    There is no report of crisis in jute industry including closure of jute mills, loss of jobs, intense competition and cheap imports from Bangladesh. In-fact, during the last two years 10 jute twine mills have re-opened in Andhra Pradesh benefitting 20,000 workmen directly and indirectly. With a view to protect domestic jute industry, anti- dumping duty on import of jute goods from Bangladesh and Nepal has been imposed w.e.f. 5 th January, 2017. The details of jute/jute products produced and imported/exported during the last three years is at Annexure-A.


    Government of India is implementing various schemes for welfare of jute workers, improving productivity and quality of jute and overall development of jute industry in jute growing states. The details of various schemes implemented for upliftment of jute sector are at Annexure-B.


    National Jute Board (NJB) is implementing the Incentive scheme for Acquisition of Plants and Machinery (ISAPM) for modernization in Jute mills & JDP units. During 2014-15 to 2018-19, NJB has released capital subsidy amounting to Rs. 4971.19 lakhs to jute mills and JDP units.
