    Under Public Distribution System (PDS) reforms, more than 4.12 Lakh FPSs (77%) out of total 5.34 Lakh FPSs have been automated across the country by installing electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) devices. Presently, nearly 10 Cr. ePoS transaction out of 23 Cr. ration cards, are being done through after biometric/authentication of beneficiaries on ePoS devices in online mode.


    Under PDS, the responsibility of distributing the foodgrains to beneficiaries lies with the State/UT Governments. Further, Department of Food & Public Distribution has issued clear instructions to States/UTs that no genuine beneficiary/household should be denied of entitled quantity of foodgrains due to unavailability of internet connectivity or any other technical failure and other reasons.


    No information regarding number of ePoS machines having stable, 24x7 internet connectivity is maintained in the Department.


    Against total stocks of 742.52 LMT (as on 01.07.2019), the total storage capacity available with Food Corporation of India (FCI) , Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and the State Agencies (both owned and hired capacity), was 878.55 LMT (as on 30.06.2019) comprising 745.00 LMT in covered godowns and 133.55 LMT in Cover and Plinth (CAP) storage. As such, there is sufficient capacity for storage of Central Pool foodgrains at the national level.


    However, depending on requirement in specific areas and for modernization of the storage facilities, the Government implements the following schemes for construction of godowns and silos for storage of Central Pool Stocks in the country:

     1. Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) Scheme: Under this Scheme, a capacity of 24.13 LMT has been created during the last 5 years i.e. 2014-15 to 2018-19.
     2. Central Sector Scheme (erstwhile Plan Scheme): Under this Scheme, a capacity of 1.94 LMT has been created during the last 5 years i.e. 2014-15 to 2018-19.
     3. Construction of Steel Silos: Under this Scheme, a capacity of 6.75 LMT has been created during the last 5 years i.e. 2014-15 to 2018-19.

    The foodgrains available with FCI is stored and preserved properly. Food grains are perishable commodity and FCI is storing/handling large quantities of foodgrains over long periods. Out of these Stocks, some quantities become Non-issuable/rotten due to various reasons like:

     1. Transit damages viz enroute damage in wagon/truck due to contamination, wagon roof leakage etc.
     2. Due to Natural Calamities like Cyclone/flood damages.
     3. In some cases due to negligence of officials/ officers, for which suitable disciplinary action against defaulters, where ever found guilty, are invariably taken.

    Statement showing quantum of foodgrains got damaged in FCI during the last 3 year and current year is at Annexure.
