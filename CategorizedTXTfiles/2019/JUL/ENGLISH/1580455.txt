      Posted On: 26 JUL 2019 5:28PM by PIB Delhi


    The ICDS Scheme has an in-built monitoring system since its inception to track the physical progress of the scheme in respect of various input process, output and impact indicators through a standardized Management Information System (MIS) through regular reports on monthly, quarterly and half yearly basis. To strengthen the monitoring of Anganwadi Services Scheme revised MIS known as ICDS-Rapid Reporting System (RRS) has also been introduced for capturing the data of AWCs online. Under the ICDS-RRS each Anganwadi Centre is assigned a 11digit unique code and login password is allotted at the supervisor level to submit the monthly progress report. As on 31 st March 2019, out of 13,72,872 operational AWCs 13,61,714 AWCs have been assigned the 11digit unique code. The State-wise detail is given at Annexure-I. Assigning the 11 digit unique code to the remaining AWCs is already on.


    In addition, the digitization of physical registers has been taken up with roll-out of ICDS-CAS Software Application under POSHAN Abhiyaan Mission of Ministry of Women and Child Development. The ICDS-CAS mobile based software enables the identification of underweight children based on auto-plotting of Growth Charts. The drill-down dashboard available at National, State, District, Block level contributes towards identifying and addressing the problem of nutrition. Thus, improve overall service delivery. As on 30 th June, 2019 more than 3,55,000 Anganwadi Workers are using ICDS-CAS Application across 21 States/UTs. The State-wise details are at Annexure -II.


    Under POSHAN Abhiyaan Smart Phones are provided to Supervisors and Anganwadi workers to provide online data. The mechanism to implement the project in State/UTs include regular review through Video Conferencing, meetings and visits by officers to the States/UTs. The timeline to implement the activities under POSHAN Abhiyaan is March 2020 for all State/UTs.


    The child beneficiaries under the Anganwadi Services Scheme are provided Supplementary Nutrition as per the guidelines. Monthly Village Health and Sanitation Day and Community Based Events are organised by States/UTs to improve status of nutrition of children. Pre-school Education is another service provided under the Anganwadi Services scheme.This covers non-formal education to the children in the age group of 3-6 years. State/UTs are provided with the funds for Pre-School Education Kits for each Anganwadi Centre at Rs. 5,000/- per annum. Training is imparted to Anganwadi Workers so that they can improve the literacy and numeracy skills of children of their respective AWC.
