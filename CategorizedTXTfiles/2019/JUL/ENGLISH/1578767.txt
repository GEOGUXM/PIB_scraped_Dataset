    In comparison to 2017-18 (9.62 million tonnes), Indiaâ€™s total steel export has declined by 34% in 2018-19 and stood at 6.36 million tonnes.


    In order to protect the domestic industry from unfair external competition, appropriate trade measures such as anti dumping duties and countervailing duties have been imposed. Government has also notified 53 Steel and Steel Product (Quality Control) Orders which is applicable for both domestic production as well as imports. The Steel Quality Control Order are implemented in the public interest for protection of human, animal and plant, safety of environment, prevention of unfair trade practices and national security.


    Trade related issues are a part of ongoing economic relationship discussion between India and US.


    This information was given by the Union Minister for steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
