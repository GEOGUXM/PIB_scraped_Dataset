    Union Home Secretary shri Rajiv Gauba reviews the LWE scenario at a meeting held here today with Chief Secretary, DGP of affected states, DIB and DGs of the CAPFs.


    It was noted that there has been a consistent decline in violence and considerable shrinkage in geographical spread of LWE in the last 5 years. The review of LWE affected districts in 2018, resulted in reduction of SRE districts from 126 districts to 82. However 8 new districts have been added to the list as a pre-emptive measure.


    A detailed exchange of views took place. Useful suggestions and security concerns by the States were taken note of. Making mobile communication more effective and improvement in the working conditions of the security forces deployed in the LWE theatre were also discussed.


    It was decided to carry forward the resolute implementation of National Policy and Action Plan to address Left Wing Extremism â€“ 2015


    Union Home Secretary appreciated the efforts of States and the Central forces. He further mentioned the need for continued operations and stressed upon filling up of areas of security vacuum. He assured that resources required in the endeavour, shall be provided to States and CAPF.
