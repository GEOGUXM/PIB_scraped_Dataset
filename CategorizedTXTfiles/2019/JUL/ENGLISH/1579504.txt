      Implementation of One Nation-One Ration Card Scheme
      Posted On: 19 JUL 2019 4:45PM by PIB Delhi


    To sustain the reforms brought in by scheme on ‘End to End Computerization of Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) Operations’ the Department of Food & Public Distribution has launched a new scheme namely “Integrated Management of Public Distribution System (IM-PDS)” for implementation during 2018-19 and 2019-20. The main objective of the scheme is to introduce nation-wide portability of ration card holders under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA), to lift their entitlement foodgrains from any FPS in the country without the need to obtain a new ration card, by integrating the existing PDS systems/portals of States/UTs with the Central systems/portals, etc. The national portability under ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ system shall be applicable only to the ration card holders under NFSA.


    Under IM-PDS scheme, there is no requirement to change the functioning of existing PDS systems/operations of the States/UTs.


    So far, 20 States/UTs have completed the installation of electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) devices in all FPSs. This scheme is planned to commence in phased manner in States/UTs preferably in States/UTs having ePoS devices functioning properly in FPSs.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution , Shri Danve Raosaheb Dadarao in the Rajya Sabha today.
