    The efforts to prevent import of fake /counterfeit/sub-standard goods is an ongoing process. Under the Foreign Trade Policy, legal provisions exist to protect the Indian consumers and producers, as imported goods are subject to the same domestic laws, rules, orders, regulations, technical specifications, environmental, and safety norms. The BIS standards applicable to domestic goods are also applicable to imported goods.


    Central Board of Indirect taxes and Customs (CBIC) has taken a number of measures to prevent the import of counterfeit products in India, which are enumerated below:


    Notification No.51/2010-Customs (N.T.) dated 30.6.2010 as amended vide notification No. 57/2018-Customs(N.T.) dated 22 nd June, 2018 was issued to prohibit import of goods for sale or use in India, which are covered under specified legal provisions of the following statutes that regulate products with false trade mark, fraudulent or obvious imitation of design and false Geographical indication or product which infringe registered copyright.


    Trade Marks Act, 1999;


    Copyright Act, 1957;


    Designs Act, 2000;


    Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999; and


    The Intellectual Property Rights (Imported Goods) Enforcement Rules 2007 notified vide notification No. 47/2007-Customs (N.T.) dated 8 th May, 2007, as amended vide notification No. 56/2018-Customs (N.T.) dated 22 nd June, 2018 lays down a detailed procedure to be followed by the right holders or their authorized representatives as also by the Customs for seeking suspension of release of suspect imported goods.


    Indian Customs has put in place a web-based Intellectual Property Rights module viz. Automatic Recordation and Targeting for IPR Protection (ARTS), for effective administration of the legal measures. ARTS has been integrated with the Indian Customs Risk Management System for targeting import of counterfeit and pirated goods (http//ipr.icegate.gov.in).


    The holders of Intellectual property rights registered and valid in India can record their Intellectual Property Rights with Customs, following above legal provisions for protection of their IPRs against imports of infringing goods.


    This information was given by the Minister of State in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Hardeep Singh Puriin a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
