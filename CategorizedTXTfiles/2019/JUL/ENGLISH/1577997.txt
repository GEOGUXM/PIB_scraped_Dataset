      Employment under Mgnregs
      Posted On: 09 JUL 2019 6:09PM by PIB Delhi


    The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (MGNREGA) provides at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. State/UT-wise details of households having completed 100 days of employment under MGNREGS including Telangana during the last three years i.e. 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 are given at Annexure. MGNREGS provides livelihood security i.e., fall back option for livelihood for the rural households when no better employment opportunity is available. It is demand driven programme. The demand for work is influenced by various factors such as rain-fall, availability of alternative and remunerative employment opportunities outside MGNREGS.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister for Rural Development, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar in the Lok Sabha today.
