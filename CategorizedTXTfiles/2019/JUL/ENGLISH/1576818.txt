      Posted On: 03 JUL 2019 3:32PM by PIB Delhi


    The number of misguided local youth joining militancy has shown a declining trend during the current year. During the past two year’s i.e. 2017 and 2018, the number of foreign terrorists neutralized is more than the local terrorists.


    Government is implementing a number of measures to increase employment opportunities for the youth and to improve the livelihood of people in Jammu & Kashmir. These include:

      * More than 25,000 youth are being recruited in 5 New India Reserve Battalions, 2 New Border Battalions, 2 New Women Battalions. 10,000 additional posts of Special Police Officers (SPOs) have been sanctioned besides recruitments in the Indian Army and special recruitment in CAPFs.
      * Skill development training to make the youth employable under various schemes such as Himayat, Udaan and PM Kaushal Vikas Yojana.
      * Starting new educational institutions in Jammu and Kashmir besides providing scholarships under PM’s Special Scholarship Scheme for higher education in colleges and universities outside the state.
      * Under “Watan Ko Jano” program, the youth of J&K are being taken to various parts of the country. Special youth and student exchange programs in sports activities at district and block level are being undertaken.

    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G. Kishan Reddy in a written reply to question in the Rajya Sabha today.
