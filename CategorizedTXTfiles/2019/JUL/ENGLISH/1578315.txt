Almost all major stations over Indian Railway were covered during this operation.


    During the drive, 1371 persons were arrested for selling of packaged drinking water of unauthorised brands under different sections i.e. 144 & 153 of Rly. Act. Total 69294 bottles of PDW have been seized. Total fine amount of Rs. 6,80,855/- have been realized from these offenders. 4 Pantry car managers involved in selling of the same were also arrested.
