      One Nation - One Ration Card Scheme
      Posted On: 26 JUL 2019 3:19PM by PIB Delhi


    To sustain the reforms brought in by scheme on ‘End to End Computerization of Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) Operations’ the Department of Food & Public Distribution has launched a new scheme namely “Integrated Management of Public Distribution System (IM-PDS)” for implementation during 2018-19 and 2019-20. The main objective of the scheme is to introduce nation-wide portability of ration card holders under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA), to lift their entitlement foodgrains from any FPS in the country without the need to obtain a new ration card, by integrating the existing PDS systems/portals of States/UTs with the Central systems/portals, etc.


    Keeping in view the physical progress under ongoing scheme and readiness for implementation of National Portability in few States, it has been decided to implement inter-State/National Portability on a pilot basis in few States shortly. Further, as and when any State/UT achieve the readiness it will be added on the National Portability platform, i.e. Public Distribution System Network (PDSN) to provide the benefit of national/inter-State portability to all ration card holders under NFSA. Presently NFSA provides the coverage for about 81.34 Crore persons across the country. State-wise statement showing coverage under NFSA is annexed.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri Danve Raosaheb Dadarao in the Rajya Sabha today.
