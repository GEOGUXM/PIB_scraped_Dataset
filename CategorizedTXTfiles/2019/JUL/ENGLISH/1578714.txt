      Posted On: 15 JUL 2019 1:19PM by PIB Delhi


    Biomass and organic waste sources like paddy straw, farm stubble, agricultural residue, cattle dung, sugarcane press mud, distillery spent wash, municipal solid waste, sewage treatment plantswaste, etc. offer huge potential for biogas production.


    Government is promoting the use of Compressed Bio Gas (CBG) as an alternative green transport fuel for efficient management of biomass and organic waste. In this direction, Oil PSUs have launched ‘Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation’ (SATAT) initiative on 1 st October 2018. SATAT initiative has the potential of addressing environmental problems arising from landfill emissions, farm stubble burning, etc. and also bring down dependency on oil/gas import. Till June, 2019, Oil Marketing Companies and Gas Marketing Companies have awarded Letter of Intent (LoI) for 344 plants for production and supply of CBG.


    This information was given by the Union Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan in a written reply to the Lok Sabha today.
