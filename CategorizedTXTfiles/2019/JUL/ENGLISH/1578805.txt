    As per the Budget speech 2019-20, Honâ€™ble Finance Minister has, inter-alia, proposed that business establishments with annual turnover of more than Rs.50 crore shall offer low cost digital modes of payment to their customers and no charges or Merchant Discount Rate shall be imposed on customers as well as merchants. RBI and Banks will absorb these costs from the savings that will accrue to them on account of handling less cash as people move to these digital modes of payment.
