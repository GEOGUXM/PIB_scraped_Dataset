      Posted On: 19 JUL 2019 5:28PM by PIB Delhi


    Any organic food manufactured, packed, sold, offered for sale, marketed or otherwise distributed in the country is regulated as per the provisions of Food Safety and Standards (Organic Food) Regulations, 2017, which were notified on 29.12.2017 and enforced from 01.07.2018. These regulations require Organic Food to comply with the provisions of National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) or Participatory Guarantee System (PGS). However, to support small original organic producer or producer organisation, those with annual turnover not exceeding 12 lakhs per annum have been exempted from certification through NPOP or PGS. The Organic food covered through these regulations should bear FSSAI organic logo i.e. Jaivik Bharat logo along with PGS- Organic (or) India Organic logo. Jaivik Kheti portal (https://www.jaivikkheti.in/) has also been created for promotion and sale of organic produce to connect farmers involved in organic farming with consumers directly for better prices. Already 80,000 farmers are registered on the portal.


    
    Value addition, packaging, marketing of organic products has been promoted under organic schemes of Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER). Different brands have been developed at State level under these schemes for organic food marketing


    This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shri Narendra Singh Tomar in Rajya Sabha today.
