    Government of India has approved the Centrally Sponsored Pilot Scheme on “Fortification of Rice and its Distribution under Public Distribution System” on 14.02.2019 - rice to be fortified with Iron, Folic Acid and Vitamin B-12. The Pilot Scheme has been approved for a period of three year beginning 2019-20. The Pilot Scheme will focus on 15 districts preferably 1 district per State during the initial phase of implementation.


    The operational responsibilities for implementation of the Pilot Scheme lie with the States/UTs. States/UTs have been requested to operationalize the blending of fortified rice and its distribution through PDS as early as possible. So far only nine State Governments i.e. Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Assam & Tamil Nadu have consented and identified their respective districts for implementation of the Pilot Scheme.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri Danve Raosaheb Dadarao in the Rajya Sabha today.
