      Urban Haats in Rajasthan
      Posted On: 18 JUL 2019 4:40PM by PIB Delhi


    The proposals for setting up Urban Haats for Sikar and Alwar were received from the state of Rajasthan. A Project Approval Monitoring Committee (PAMC) meeting was held under the chairmanship of Development Commissioner (Handicrafts), wherein the proposal for construction of Sikar Urban Haat could not be considered as the State Government of Rajasthan had already been constructing Urban Haat at Sikar.


    Further, the land proposed by Implementing Agency for setting up Urban Haat at Alwar was not found suitable by the committee. Accordingly, the implementing agency was requested to propose a new venue for setting up Urban Haat at Alwar. At present, three Urban Haats are functional in Rajasthan at Ajmer, Jodhpur and Jaipur.


    This information was given by the Union Minister of Textiles, Smriti Zubin Irani, in written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
