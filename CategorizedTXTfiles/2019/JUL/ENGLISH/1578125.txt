    Besides other facilities, high capacity Blast Furnaces (>4000 m 3 volume), modern Steel Melting Shops and new state-of-the-art Rolling Mills have been installed which have the capability to produce various value added products.


    For improving market viability of products from the new mills, the initiatives taken by SAIL in the area of Marketing, inter-alia, include the following:-


      * Dedicated cross functional teams.


      * Parallel Flange Structural from Universal Structural Mill (USM) at ISP & Medium Structural Mill (MSM) at DSP branded as SAIL“NEX’.


      * A new brand of TMT bars named SAIL “SeQR” for safer construction launched.


      * Various Seminars on the theme “New Challenges in Steel Design & Construction” have been organized to showcase the wide ranging applicability of structural sections as well as advantages of Design and Construction using SAIL structurals and Parallel Flange Beams.
