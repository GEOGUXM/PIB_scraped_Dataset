    Thrust areas of the CSR activities inter-alia include promotion of education & health, women empowerment, sustainable income generation through Self Help Groups, assistance to divyangs, access to water and sanitation facilities, village development, environment sustenance, Sports Coaching, Promotion of Traditional Art & culture etc. CSR Projects are located in the States of Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha etc. The CSR works benefit society at large, therefore, exact number of beneficiaries due to individual work by CPSEs, location-wise and undertaking-wise, is not measurable and is not maintained.


    CSR funds are not allocated State-wise, CSR projects by CPSEs under Ministry of Steel are mainly carried out in periphery of steel plants, steel townships and mines which are predominantly inhabited by Scheduled Tribe, Scheduled Castes and Backward population.


    This information was given by Minister of Steel, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan in a written reply to the Lok Sabha today.
