      Implementation of National Health Protection Scheme
      Posted On: 09 JUL 2019 4:00PM by PIB Delhi


    Ayushman Bharat – PradhanMantri Jan ArogyaYojana (AB-PMJAY) is a centrally sponsored scheme. The ratio of contribution towards premium between Centre and State is 60:40 in all States except North Eastern States and the three Himalayan States, where the ratio is 90:10. In the case of Union Territories, the Central contribution of premium is 100% for UTs without legislature, while the ratio of contribution is 60:40 for those with legislature. Therefore, Government is already providing financial support to the States which need additional resources to implement the scheme.


    At the time of launch of AB-PMJAY, many states were implementing the centrally sponsored health insurance scheme Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana while some of the states had their own health insurance/assurance schemes from their own resources. AB-PMJAY aims to build synergies with the existing health insurance/assurance schemes of the states. In other words, both the schemes can run concurrently and leveraging each others’ strengths. AB-PMJAY has been designed in such a manner that it is aspirational, entitlement-based, and portable while ensuring the spirit of cooperative federalism. States will significantly benefit through the following features of AB-PMJAY:

     1. National portability
     2. Additional Resources
     3. State-of-the-art IT Platform
     4. Data and Fraud/Abuse Analytics

    States will also learn from the experience of other States in implementation of similar schemes.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha, here today.
