      Posted On: 22 JUL 2019 3:56PM by PIB Delhi


    Various new steps taken by the Government to ensure self-reliance in procuring the defence equipment include introduction of ‘Buy [Indian-Indigenous Design Development Manufacture (IDDM)]’ as the most preferred acquisition category in the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP), “Strategic Partnership” model to enhance indigenous defence manufacturing capabilities through the private sector, simplification of Make-II procedure & introduction of ‘Suo-Moto’ proposals. These measures are enabling self-reliance, wider participation of Indian industry in defence procurements and are providing impetus to production including by the MSME sector.


    The prospective technologies/equipment to be inducted by the Armed Forces are shared with Industry through the Technology Perspective and Capability Roadmap (TPCR) which is in the public domain. This provides a roadmap for indigenous development of defence equipment.The details of defence procurement and production undertaken during the last three years is as given below:
