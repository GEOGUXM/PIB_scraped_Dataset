      Posted On: 03 JUL 2019 2:36PM by PIB Delhi


    Recognizing the additional responsibility on the shoulder of employees who are single mothers, and based on the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC), the Government has relaxed the conditionality of availing of CCL in three spells in a calendar year to six spells in a calendar year for single female Government servant vide notification dated 11.12.2018.


    Further, the 7th CPC has observed that the CCL as a welfare measure is seen as a benefit that has to be availed simply because it exists, and there is a palpable need to bring in some inhibiting factor so as to ensure that only genuinely affected employees avail of this scheme. Government has accepted and implemented the recommendation of 7th CPC in this regard that 100% of the salary shall be paid for the first 365 days of CCL, and that 80% of the salary shall be paid for the next 365 days vide the above notification .


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
