    The Union Health Minister further said that ‘multisectoral action’ is one of the key strategies which makes a strong case for transforming India’s TB elimination efforts from a siloed health sector response to a holistic approach. Citing the example of polio to highlight multi-sectoral approach, Dr Harsh Vardhan stated that TB is not only a medical problem, it has social dimensions and needs to be addressed through multi-sectoral approach. “All of us can be leaders to end TB in our own capacities.I believe that together we will be able to develop new approaches to combat such threats to our health and society,” he added.


    Dr Harsh Vardhan further said that through the Inter-ministerial Coordination the aim is to reach key populations served by various Ministries such as workers, miners, migrants, tribal population, women and children etc, and develop a social movement for collective efforts and create a ‘Jan Andolan’ by every section of the Society for Ending TB in India.

    Although entirely preventable and curable, Tuberculosis is a major obstacle to India’s human and economic development. India,in near future, is predicted to have world’s largest working population and a disease like TB which mostly affects adults in their most productive years, poses a great risk to the country’s economic growth potential. Apart from being a public health problem, TB is also associated with poor socio-economic development, marginalization and exploitation. The actions required to tackle the socio-economic and structural determinants of TB lie beyond the purview of the health sector alone, calling for a harmonized multisectoral response.
