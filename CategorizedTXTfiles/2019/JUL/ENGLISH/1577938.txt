    Two Pilot projects have been taken up to replace the existing “old design/composite fencing” with a new “anti-cut and anti-rust” modular fencing (New Design Fence). While the pilot project for construction of New Design Fence in 3 Km border length in Assam has been completed, another pilot project in 7.18 Km border length in Punjab has been approved and work has been awarded.


    It has been decided to deploy technological solutions in the form of Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS), in difficult terrain on Indo-Pakistan Border (IPB) and Indo-Bangladesh Border (IBB). CIBMS involves integration of manpower, sensors, networks, intelligence and command & control solutions and includes inter alia Electro-Optic Sensors (high resolution day & night cameras), Radars and other devices. To begin with two pilot projects covering about 71 Kms. on Indo-Pakistan Border (10 Kms.) and Indo-Bangladesh Border (61 Kms.) have been completed.
