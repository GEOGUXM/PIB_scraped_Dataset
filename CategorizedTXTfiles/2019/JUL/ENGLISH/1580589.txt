    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will release the results of the fourth cycle of the All India Tiger Estimation - 2018, at Lok Kalyan Marg on Monday, July 29, 2019.


    The Tiger Estimation exercise is believed to be the worldâ€™s largest wildlife survey effort in terms of coverage, intensity of sampling and quantum of camera trapping.


    India conducts the All India Tiger Estimation every four years. Three cycles of the estimation have already been completed in 2006, 2010 and 2014.


    The Government and National Tiger Conservation Authority have also carried out an economic valuation of tigers in mitigating the adverse impact of climate change. Such interventions and processes have been operationalised through a legally mandated Tiger Conservation Plan to ensure that it is institutionalized.
