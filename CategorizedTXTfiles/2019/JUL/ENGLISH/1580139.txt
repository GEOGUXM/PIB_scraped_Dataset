    All the schemes of Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment have guidelines for proper implementation and the implementing agencies are required to comply with guidelines. Regular monitoring of these schemes is being done through progress reports, meetings, conferences, video conferencing and regular field visits. Proposals are scrutinized by Multidisciplinary State Level Grant-in-aid Committee and submission of Utilization Certificate duly verified by Chartered Accountant.


    No data regarding number of Scheduled Caste persons living below the poverty line is available in the Ministry. However, all such schemes being implemented for the welfare of Scheduled Castes have the objective of developing a balanced and egalitarian society in India.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Rattan Lal Kataria in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
