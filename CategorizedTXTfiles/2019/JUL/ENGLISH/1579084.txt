      Posted On: 17 JUL 2019 3:08PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government is aware of the low conviction rate under the Bonded Labour (Abolition) Act, 1976.


    Possible reasons for low conviction, as discussed in different forums are as under:


    (i) General social bias.


    (ii) Nature of bonded labour being migrants, absentism of Witnesses due to their migratory


    Nature.


    (iii) DM/SDM Courts not as proficient in trial as judicial Courts.


    The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act 1976 is being implemented by the concerned State Govts./UTs. The Act provides for an institutional mechanism at the district level in the form of Vigilance Committees. For the purpose of implementing the provisions of this Act, the State Governments/UTs may confer, on an Executive Magistrate, the powers of a Judicial Magistrate of the first class or second class for trial of offences under this Act. Government of India has introduced a revamped Central Sector Scheme for Rehabilitation of Bonded Labourers- 2016, under which financial assistance to the tune of Rs.1.00 (one) lakh, Rs.2.00 (two) lakhs & Rs. 3.00 (three) lakhs are provided to released bonded labourers based on their category and level of exploitation along with other non-cash assistance for their livelihood.


    This information was given by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Minister of State (I/C) for Labour and Employment in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
