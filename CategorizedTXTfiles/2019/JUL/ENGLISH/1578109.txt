    To combat the LWE menace in a holistic manner, the Government of India has formulated a National Policy and Action Plan in 2015, which envisages a multi-pronged approach comprising security, development and ensuring rights & entitlements of local communities etc.


    MHA is supporting the State Governments extensively by way of deployment of CAPF Battalions, provision of helicopters and UAVs and sanction of India Reserve Battalions (IRBs)/ Special India Reserve Battalions (SIRBs) etc. Funds are provided under Modernisation of Police Force (MPF), Security Related Expenditure (SRE) Scheme and Special Infrastructure Scheme (SIS) for capacity building of State Police, intelligence agencies and CAPFs.


    Development interventions are made through provision of resources and focused implementation of schemes through line ministries of Government of India. Significant efforts have been made for improving infrastructure in LWE affected areas. 5500 km of roads out of 11000 planned have been constructed. For improving telecom connectivity, 2335 mobile towers have been installed and 4072 mobile towers will be installed in next phase of the project.


    To provide further impetus to development and fill critical gaps in infrastructure, funds are provided to the State Governments under ‘Special Central Assistance’ (SCA) scheme @Rs 33.33 Crore per annum per most affected district.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G. Kishan Reddy in a written reply to question in the Rajya Sabha today.
