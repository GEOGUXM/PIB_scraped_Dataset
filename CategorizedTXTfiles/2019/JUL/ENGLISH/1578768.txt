RINL             NIL     374   
                               
                               

    As per the Companies Act, 2013, Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) under Ministry of Steel earmark at least 2% of the average net profits made during the three immediately preceding financial years for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities. Unspent balance for the previous year, if any, is carried forward to the next year for utilisation for the purpose for which it was allocated. Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd.(RINL) have even allocated CSR funds during loss years to sustain the momentum of the ongoing committed CSR activities. Funds under Corporate Social Responsibility are not allocated by CPSEs, State/UT-wise.


    The Government has notified National Steel Policy 2017; the policy for providing preference to Domestically Manufactured Iron & Steel Products (DMI&SP) in Government Procurement and has modified Rule 136(1) (iii) of General Financial Rules to incorporate the principle of life cycle cost analysis. These interventions will help in creation of enhanced demand of steel, which in turn, will lead to enhanced steel production by steel companies which includes Steel PSUs as well, to meet the requirements of the country.


    This information was given by the Union Minister for steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
