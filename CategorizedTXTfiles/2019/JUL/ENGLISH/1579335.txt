    Salient features of the Khelo India Scheme and major sports disciplines identified for conduct of competitions, support to sporting talents, etc., is given in Annexure - 1.


    The sporting talents selected under the Talent Search and Development vertical of the Khelo India Scheme are eligible to join any of the accredited Academies under the Scheme where infrastructure is available for high end training.


    There is no proposal at this juncture to de-link students from the regular stream of education and establish an independent University/Board to protect these students of proper schooling and certification/graduation while purely engaged in sports training under the Khelo India Scheme, as financial provision has been made under the Scheme to support schooling of children who have been selected for training there under.


    A total of 2437 sportspersons have been identified under the Talent Search and Development Vertical of the Khelo India Scheme, including from rural areas. This vertical provides for selection of players through a three-tier structure consisting of Talent Scouting Committee, Talent Identification and Development Committee for training, with final selection done with the approval of a High Power Committee (HPC).


    Participation in the Khelo India Games is State-wise and not district-wise. State-wise details of participants and medal winners of the Khelo India School Games, 2018 and Khelo India Youth Games, 2019, is given in Annexure 2. Year-wise and State-wise details of sporting talents identified under the Khelo India Scheme are given in Annexure 3.


    Linking more and more people with the Khelo India Scheme is a continuous process. Awareness of the Scheme has been created through different platforms including dedicated website and digital media platform for Khelo India.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (I/C) Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.

    BRIEF ON VERTICALS OF KHELO INDIA SCHEME


     1. Play Field Development: - A National inventory of playfields and sports infrastructure will be prepared on a Geographic Information System (GIS) platform for their optimum utilisation. In order to put in place a strong institutionalized mechanism for preserving, protecting, developing and promoting playfields, State and district playfield Associations will be created in all States/UTs on the lines of National Playfield Association of India (NPFAI). District and State level Associations will register existing play areas, map them on the GIS platform and affiliate with the National Playing Fields Association (NPFAI) through district and State associations, thereby creating a National database. Development of playgrounds in all gram panchayats can be taken up in convergence with the scheme of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and any other scheme(s) of the State Government/Central Government. It would also include development of model playfields on pilot basis.


     1. Community Coaching Development: - A cascading model of Community Coach Development will be adopted for development of community coaches across the country. This will involve skill development and certification system. A short term community coaching development programme will be evolved and identified Physical Education Teachers (PETs) nominated by States/UTs will be trained as master trainers or coach developers. Such Master Trainers will, in turn, train other PETs/Volunteers in their respective States/UTs as community coaches and develop teams at community level. Online courses for community coach development will also be developed at primary and advanced levels.


     1. State Level Khelo India Centres:- A large number of sports infrastructure set up throughout the country are not being utilised optimally due to lack of coaches/part-time coaches, supports staff such as physiotherapists and masseurs, equipment, proper field of play, consumables, day boarding facilities, etc., as well as lack of adequate financial support for meeting recurring expenditure. Accordingly, it is proposed to support better utilization of sports infrastructure belonging to States/UTs through suitable Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and provide support for engagement of coaches, providing day-boarding facilities as per the Sports Authority of India (SAI) Scheme.


     1. Annual Sports Competitions: - Khelo India will be the basic platform to showcase sporting skills and accordingly become a platform for talent spotting at the national level and providing development pathways for gifted and talented children to achieve excellence. The Central Government will organize school and college level National level competitions in respect of priority sports disciplines at various places across the country by associating concerned National Sports Federations (NSFs) and School Game Federation of India (SGFI) and University Sports promotion bodies including Association of Indian Universities (AIU).


     1. Talent Identification and Development: - The National competitions involving schools, colleges, Universities and NSFs under Khelo India Scheme, National Championships, and National Sports Talent Search Portal of SAI, will provide a platform for identification of talented sports persons in priority Sports disciplines in which the country has potential/advantage. In addition to selection of prize winners, the duly constituted talent identification committee may also adopt globally accepted scientific methods to spot and identify talent in various sports disciplines. Identification of sporting talent will involve conduct of pan-India trials of children by Talent Scouts (to be engaged for the purpose), in association with States/UTs.


     1. Utilization and Creation of Sports Infrastructure


    Majority of the schools, colleges and even Universities lack proper play grounds as well as sporting infrastructure in the country. Efforts will be made to utilize the existing available sports infrastructure through a system of active management committee consisting of players and members of neighborhood community as well all over the country especially those under the control of Central Government/State Governments. A suitable mechanism will be evolved to identify gaps in availability of sporting infrastructure across the country and fill these gaps with support under Khelo India. Scheme of Khelo India will also be converged with Members of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) Scheme. The States may also provide for convergence of Member of Legislative Assembly Local Area Development (MLALAD) Scheme with Khelo India Scheme. This Component will have the following two sub components :-


     1. University Centre of Excellence Programme: For setting up centers of sporting excellence in selected Universities.

     2. Creation of Appropriate Sports Infrastructure: Under this component, grants-in-aid will be provided to States/ UTs, SAI etc. to develop critical sports infrastructure and other infrastructure where there are gaps.

     1. Support to National/ Regional/State Sports Academies: - The sports talents identified under the Scheme will be given the option to join SAI National Sports Academies, State Sports Academies and Sports Schools or Sports Academies established by private sector. Grants-in-aid will be provided for establishment, operation and maintenance of sports academies in respect of identified disciplines to Sports Authority of India, State Governments or to private sector or sports person under Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode for facilitating and supplementing Long Term Athlete Development (LTAD) programme (for 8 years). At least one academy for Para Athletes will be supported.


     1. Physical Fitness: - An effort will be made to implement a component of physical fitness across all schools in India under Khelo India. National Physical Fitness parameters will be evolved region- wise and a tool kit will be provided to each school to evaluate physical fitness of all school going children throughout the country, in all States/UTs. A mechanism will be evolved to perform an advisory role for integration of Sports and physical education. Sports will be integrated with School education by making it a compulsory subject for which marks will be awarded. This will be done in conjunction with the Department of School Education & Literacy.


     1. Sports for Women: - While all the components of the Khelo India Scheme are gender neutral and afford opportunities to women too for participating in sporting activities and development of sports, it is proposed to hold annual national competitions for women. Emphasis will be laid on such sports disciplines where there is less participation of women so that more number of women will participate in such sports disciplines.


     1. Sports for Peace & Development: - The Government of India, under the Special Package for J&K is providing funds to the tune of Rs.200 crore for enhancement of sports facilities in the State. To ensure optimal utilization of these infrastructure, soft support in terms of coaches, equipment, consumables, technical support, competition etc. will be provided. Efforts will be made to organize block level competitions in respect of sports disciplines popular in the State of J&K for positive engagement of youth. Similar efforts will also be made in case of other extremism and terrorism affected and other disturbed areas.


     1. Promotion of sports among persons with disabilities: - Financial assistance will be provided to States/UTs and SAI for creation of specialist sports infrastructure for persons with disabilities. Funds required for making stadia disabled friendly / barrier free will be accessed from Scheme for Implementation of Persons with Disabilities Act (SIPDA) of Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities. The funds provided under this head will be used for classification of players, equipment, training and preparation of teams for Paralympic Games and disciplines and competitions.


    l) Promotion of rural and indigenous/tribal games: - In order to showcase our rural and indigenous/tribal games, annual competitions will be held annually under the Khelo India Scheme in rural and indigenous/tribal games alternately. A dynamic and interactive website providing information on such games will also be put up. This will not only help disseminate information and pique the curiosity of the present generation about these games but also encourage children and youth to take up these games in a major way, paving way for their future mainstreaming.


    Major sports disciplines identified under the Khelo India Scheme for conduct of competitions


    Major Sports which have been disciplines have been identified under the Khelo India Scheme for conduct of competitions are Archery, Athletics, Badminton, Basketball, Boxing, Chess, Cycling, Football, Gymnastics, Handball, Hockey, Judo, Kabaddi, Karate, Kho-Kho, Shooting, Swimming, Table Tennis, Taekwondo, Tennis, Volleyball, Weightlifting, Wrestling and Wushu. In addition, need based support is also being provided to other sports disciplines including indigenous games like, Kalarippayttu, Mallakhamb, Sqay.
