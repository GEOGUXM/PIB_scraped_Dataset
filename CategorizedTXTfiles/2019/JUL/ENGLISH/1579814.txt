      Posted On: 22 JUL 2019 7:04PM by PIB Delhi


    ‘A friend in need is a friend indeed’, standing true to its ethos, Indian Army integrated with its Medical and Veterinary components along with State Health and Veterinary Services is currently organising three Medical Camps and two Veterinary Camps in the Flood affected Areas of Lower Assam on 21 July and 22 July 2019. The Medical Camps are being organised in Barpeta, Moigaon and Sonitpur districts while the Veterinary Camps are being conducted in Dhubri and Nalbari districts.


    Due to incessant rains over the past few days, almost all districts of Lower Assam have been affected by flood. The Camps are established with intent to address issues pertaining to waterborne infectious diseases and epidemic threat - both to live stock and human. The said Camps are also providing Mobile Detachments of an effective outreach to neighbouring villages which are still inundated.


    Since 11 July 2019, six Flood Relief Columns of Indian Army have been requisitioned in various districts to augment the efforts of State Government during Flood Relief for evacuation of locals stuck in flood affected areas as also in reaching out and distribution of Relief Materials to the flood victims.
