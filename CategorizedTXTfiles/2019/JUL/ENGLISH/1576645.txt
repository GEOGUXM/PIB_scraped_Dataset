      Upliftment of Transgenders
      Posted On: 02 JUL 2019 2:49PM by PIB Delhi


    The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment proposes to introduce a Bill titled "The Transgender Persons (protection of Rights) Bill, 2019" in the Lok Sabha, with the aim of mitigating the stigma, discrimination and abuse against marginalized Transgender population and bring them into the mainstream of society.


    As informed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, the Employee State Insurance Act is a legislation which provides certain benefits to employees in case of sickness, maternity and employment injury and to make provision for certain other matters in relation thereto. The ESI Act does not differentiate amongst the employees covered under the Act on basis of their sex. If transgender are employed in a factory/establishment which come under the purview of ESI Act, the benefits available under the ESI Act will automatically be available to them. Hence, amendment in ESI Act is not required.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Rattan Lal Kataria in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
