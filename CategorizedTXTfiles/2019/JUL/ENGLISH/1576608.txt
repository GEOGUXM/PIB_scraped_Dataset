    In order to promote manufacturing of electric and hybrid vehicle (xEV) technology and to ensure sustainable growth of the same, the Government notified FAME-India Scheme (Phase-I) w.e.f. 1 st April 2015 for a period of 2 years with a total outlay of Rs. 795 Crore. The Phase-I of the Scheme was extended from time to time and the last extension was allowed till 31 st March 2019 with an increase in the total outlay to Rs. 895 crore.


    Phase-I of the Scheme were implemented through four focus areas namely Demand Creation, Technology Platform, Pilot Project and Charging Infrastructure. Under Demand Creation focus area of the scheme, about 2.78 lakh electric/ hybrid vehicles (xEVs) were supported with a total demand incentives of Rs. 343 Crore [Approx] for purchase of xEVs under this scheme. Also, 465 buses were sanctioned to various cities and States under this Scheme. In addition to the above, several projects were approved/sanctioned under Technology Platform, Pilot Project and Charging Infrastructure focus areas of the scheme.


    Based on outcome and experience gained during the Phase-I of FAME India Scheme and after having consultations with all stakeholders including Industry and Industry Associations, Department of Heavy Industry finalized, with the approval of Cabinet,and , notified the Phase-II of FAME India Scheme on 8 th March 2019, which is for a period of three years commencing from 1 st April 2019 with a total budgetary support of Rs. 10,000 crore. This phase will mainly focus on supporting electrification of public & shared transportation, and aims to support through subsidies 7000 e-Buses, 5 lakh e-3 Wheelers, 55000 e-4 Wheeler Passenger Cars and 10 lakh e-2 Wheelers. In addition, creation of charging infrastructure will be supported in selected cities and along major highways to address range anxiety among users of electric vehicles. This Phase of FAME Scheme envisages support for setting up of adequate public charging infrastructure to instill confidence among EV users, through active participation and involvement of various stakeholders including Government agencies, industries and Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs). A budget provision of Rs. 1000 Crore for a period of 3 years [2019-20 to 2021-22] has been earmarked for establishment of charging infrastructure under this Phase of FAME Scheme.


    Further, Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) under the Ministry of Power has informed that they have installed 209 AC Chargers (Slow) and 132 DC Chargers (Fast) all over India, (ANNEXURE).


    In addition, the following projects/proposals for establishment of charging infrastructure have also been funded under FAME India Scheme â€“

    Various other initiatives have been taken by the Government to promote electric mobility in the country. Some of them are:

      * Under new GST regime, the rates of GST on Electric Vehicles has been kept in the lower bracket of 12% (with no Cess) as against the 28% GST rate with Cess up to 22% for conventional vehicles.

    (ii) Ministry of Power has allowed sale of electricity as â€˜serviceâ€™ for charging of electric vehicles. This would provide a huge incentive to attract investments into charging infrastructure.


    (iii) Ministry of Road Transport Highways issued notification regarding exemption of permit in case of battery operated vehicles.


    Since GST on Electric Vehicle (EV) is quite less compared to conventional vehicles, Government expects growth of EV industry in near future.
