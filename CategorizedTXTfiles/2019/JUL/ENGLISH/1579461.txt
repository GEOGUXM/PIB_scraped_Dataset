      Deworming Programme
      Posted On: 19 JUL 2019 2:12PM by PIB Delhi


    Under National Health Mission, National Deworming Day (NDD) was launched in February 2015 in 277 districts of 11 States/UT, including Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Haryana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Tripura. 8.98 crore children of 1 to 19 years were provided deworming treatment during the campaign. Since 2016, the NDD programme has been scaled up to cover all the districts across the country.


    WHO has been providing logistic support to Government of India through provision of deworming drug (Albendazole tablet), which fulfils partial requirement of drugs for implementing the NDD programme.


    Based on STH prevalence data made available by National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), NDD programme is being implemented bi-annually in all the States/UTs, except Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, where it is conducted annually.


    During NDD, single dose of albendazole is administered to children from 1-19 years of age group through the platform of schools and anganwadi centres. NDD is being implemented through the combined efforts of Department of School Education and Literacy under Ministry of Human Resource and Development, Ministry of Women and Child Development and Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation to ensure maximum coverage.


    The NDD round wise coverage since 2016 are as follows:
