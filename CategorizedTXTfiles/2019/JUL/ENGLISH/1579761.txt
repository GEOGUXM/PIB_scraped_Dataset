    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:

         1. Crude oil production by ONGC during June, 2019 was 1686.22 TMT which is 1.38% lower than the target and4.95%lower when compared with June,2018. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-June, 2019 was 5136.47 TMT which is 0.57%lower than target for the period andlowerby 4.75% thanproduction during corresponding period of last year. Major reason for lower production is less offtake by consumers in Tripura, Cauvery & Rajahmundry.

         1. Crude oil production by OIL during June, 2019 was267.46 TMT which is 3.58%lower than monthly target and 3.98% lower when compared with June, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-June, 2019 was 806.62 TMT which is 3.82% lower than target for the period and3.73%lower than production during the corresponding period of last year. Major reason for lower production is less than planned contribution from workover wells and drilling wells.


         1. Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during June,2019 was 734.38 TMT which is 11.59%lower than the monthly target and 11.71%lowerthanJune, 2018.Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-June, 2019 was 2263.48 TMT which is 7.22%lowerthan target for the period and 12.16% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


     1. RJ-ON-90/1 (CEIL): Deficit is from Mangla due to delay in 45 FM (Fatehgarh-Mangla) infills ESP failure, drilling & work over activities and water leakage.

     2. Operational issues in Bhagyam, Aishwarya and ABH fields.
     3. CB-ONN-2005/9 (Mercator): Oil production from Jyoti-1 is stopped. Well closed for long term pressure build up study and could not be put back in production due to non-grant of EC for development campaign.
     4. Jyoti-2 under WO from 31.03.19.
     5. Non-grant of EC for development campaign till date leading to delay in drilling new development well.

Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-June, 2019 was 1223.28MMSCM which is 8.14% lower than the cumulative target and18.08% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


     1. KG-DWN-98/3 (RIL): MA field ceased production and closure of 2 wells in D1D3 field.

     2. KG-OSN-2001/3 (ONGC): Delay inanticipated production from well DDW D-5.
     3. RJ-ON/6(FEL): Production from wells DT-2, 11-W-2A, 11-W-1A & Sonara-1 reduced sharply due to high water cut and under performance of other wells OMM-1 & SGL-7.
     1. Raniganj East CBM Block (ESSAR): Few wells closed for planned maintenance and refrac jobs. Major customer 'Matix' operational shutdown.
     1. Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)

    Refinery production during June, 2019 was 20302.66TMT which is 3.56% lower than the target for the month and7.15% lowerwhen compared with June, 2018. Cumulative production during April-June, 2019 was 62583.57 TMT which is 0.13% lower than the target for the period and2.15% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III .

    Figure 3: Monthly Refinery Production


         1. CPSE Refineries’ production during June, 2019 was 11363.80TMT which is 5.27% lower than the target for the month and 10.50%lowerwhen compared with June, 2018.Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-June, 2019 was 34523.36 TMT which is 4.12% lower than the target for the period and7.01% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


     1. IOCL, Barauni: Lower due to Naphtha & SKO containment.

     2. IOCL, Digboi: Lower due to DCU shutdown.
     3. IOCL, Panipat: Lower due to high VGO stock.
     4. HPCL, Visakh: Lower due to unplanned shutdown of primary units.
     5. CPCL, Manali: Lower due to CDU-1 shutdown by power interruption and delayed start-up due to water shortage.
     6. NRL, Numaligarh: Lower due to shutdown of secondary unit.
     7. MRPL, Mangalore: Lower due to restrictionsin supply of water to refinery.

    3.2 Production in JV refineries during June, 2019 was 1731.74TMT which is 12.52% higher than the target for the month and4.89% higherwhen compared with June, 2018.Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-June, 2019 was 5240.77 TMT which is 12.34% higher than the target for the period and8.21%higherthan the production during corresponding period of last year.


    3.3 Production in private refineries during June, 2019 was 7207.12TMT which is lowerby 4.11% than the target both for the month andcorresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-June, 2019 was 22819.44 TMT which is higher by 3.77% than the target and corresponding period of last year.


    3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of June, 2019 and cumulatively for the period April-June, 2019vis-à-vis April-June,2018 are given at Annexures -IV and V respectively.
