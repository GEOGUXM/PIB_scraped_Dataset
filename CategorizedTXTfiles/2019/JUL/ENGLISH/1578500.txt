    Shri Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister for Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises and Road Transport & Highways, has written to all industry associations and registered MSMEs, urging them to plant as many trees as they can before the end of the monsoon season. Calling upon their collective commitment to the country, Shri Gadkari has suggested in his letter that each small enterprise can plant and maintain a minimum of 5 tress, each medium enterprise at least 50 trees and micro enterprises can plant and maintain as many trees as possible for them. The trees should be of local variety, indigenous to the area like fruit trees, neem, peepal etc. They can be planted along national or state highways and district roads. Each individual enterprise should ensure that the plants survive and grow.
