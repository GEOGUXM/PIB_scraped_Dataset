    The Ministry of Shipping is keen to start inland waterways navigation and passenger transportation in the rivers in the North Eastern states of the country. Shri Mansukh Mandaviya, MoS (I/C) of Shipping and MoS, C&F hassaid that the public sector company WAPCOS is preparing a model DPR for implementing projects for running low cost ferry services in the inland waterways in these states. This model DPR can be adopted for quick implementation by the Inland Waterways Authority of India in consultation with the different state governments in the region.


    Shri Mandaviya also said that inland waterways transport can be a game changer for the North Eastern states as land routes here are often long, circuitous and time consuming due to the difficult terrain.
