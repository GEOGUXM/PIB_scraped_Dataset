    The issue of non-filling of the vacant posts of the above functionaries is taken up in various review meetings held with the States/UTs from time to time. Considering the difficulties faced by the States/UTs and with a view to avoid vacancies in the above positions, the States/ UTs have been requested to take time bound action in this regard. States/UTs have been advised to recruit the aforesaid personnel on contract basis till such time the vacancies are filled on regular basis. Separately, States /UTs have been advised to authorize the District Magistrates to recruit AWWs and Supervisors at their level.


    No such incident has come to the notice of this Ministry in the recent past. However, if any such representation is received, it is forwarded to the concerned State Government/ UT Administration for taking necessary action, as the scheme is implemented by States/UTs.


    To improve the condition of Anganwadi Centres in the country, u nder the Anganwadi Services, construction of 1 lakh Anganwadi Centre buildings per year in convergence with Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has been approved. Central share for construction of new Anganwadi buildings @ Rs. 1.00 lakh per AWC building is reimbursed to States/UTs after completion of construction of AWC buildings.


    In addition, MWCD has formulated Swachchata Action Plan (SAP) and subsequently released funds during 2017-18 to the States/UTs to the tune of Rs. 54.12 Crore for construction of 69974 toilets and Rs. 13.28 Crore for providing drinking water facilities in 19993 Government owned Anganwadi Centres (AWCs). During 2018-19, funds to the tune of Rs. 72.67 crore for construction of 70000 toilets and for providing drinking water facilities in 20000 Government owned AWCs have been released to States/UTs.
