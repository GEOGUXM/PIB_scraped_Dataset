    The Phase-II of FAME Scheme envisages support for setting up of adequate public charging infrastructure to instill confidence among Electrical Vehicles (EV) users, through active participation and involvement of various stakeholders including Government agencies, industries and Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs).


    A budget provision of Rs. 1000 Crore for a period of 3 years [2019-20 to 2021-22] has been earmarked for setting up of charging infrastructure under Phase-II of FAME India Scheme. However, no fund for establishment of charging infrastructure has been sanctioned under this phase of the scheme so far.


    This information was given by the Minister of Heavy Industries & Public Enterprises, Arvind Ganpat Sawant, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha yesterday.
