      Procurement of Farm Produces at MSP by Private Players
      Posted On: 19 JUL 2019 4:47PM by PIB Delhi


    To give special focus to increase the spread of MSP operation in eastern states, private players for procurement of paddy/rice were engaged in Jharkhand, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh during KMS 2015-16 to KMS 2017-18.


    Further, in order to ensure remunerative prices to farmers for their produce, Private Procurement and Stockist Scheme (PPSS) under Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanraks Han Abhiyanâ€™ (PM-AASHA) has been launched in October, 2018. The objective of PPSS is to assess the workability of private agencies in the procurement operation at MSP. The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare is implementing the PPSS scheme for procurement of oilseeds.


    Government does not earmark any amount for procurement of paddy/rice through Private agencies. Depending on the quantity procured by the private agencies, the amount is paid by FCI at the rate fixed through tender.


    Under the PPSS scheme, an amount of Rs.200.00 crore has been earmarked for 2019-20.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri Danve Raosaheb Dadarao in the Rajya Sabha today.
