    The protocol was signed on 21.01.2019 and the same will be in force for a period of four years from the date of signing of the protocol.


    The tobacco leaves exported to China, which must be produced in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in India and have been cured and re-dried, must comply with the relevant phytosanitary and sanitary laws and regulations of China, and meet the requirements as stipulated in the Protocol.


    The importers of tobacco must obtain the import quarantine permit from GACC before trade contracts are signed. The tobacco leaves must be securely packaged in airproof way to prevent the contamination of quarantine pests.
