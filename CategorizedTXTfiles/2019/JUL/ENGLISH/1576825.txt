    At present, ISROâ€™s planetary missions are exploring the composition of the surface and atmosphere of planetary bodies with remote sensing tools in addition to high-resolution visible imaging to understand the terrain and topography. Our future missions to solar system may explore evidences for organics and future landing missions may include experiments to search for evidence of life.


    Department of Space has established one Regional Academic Centre for Space (RAC-S) at MNIT Jaipur. Department of Space has also signed anMoU with Central University of Jammu for establishment of a Centre for Space Science.


    A seed funding of Rs 2 crores is offered to RAC-S to start with, which can be enhanced as the project progresses. All the above initiatives are in the initial phase of getting established; therefore no patents are filed as of now.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
