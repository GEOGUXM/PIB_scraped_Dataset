      Posted On: 24 JUL 2019 6:02PM by PIB Delhi


    The concept of creamy layer in Other Backward Classes (OBC) reservation was implemented by the Government as per the directions of the Honâ€™ble Supreme Court in its judgment in the Indra Sawhney case. Recently an Expert Committee has been constituted by the Government of India under the Chairmanship of Shri B.P. Sharma (former Secretary, DOPT) on 08.03.2019 to examine particularly the issues related to Creamy layer equivalence among the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBCs) where equivalence had not been established so far.


    The Committee is expected to submit its report anytime soon.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
