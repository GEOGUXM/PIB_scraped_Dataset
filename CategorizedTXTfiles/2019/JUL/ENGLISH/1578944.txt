    The flagship store of the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC), Khadi Bhawan at Connaught Place in New Delhi has bagged order worth over Rs 7.03 crore from the Oil India Limited (OIL), in the form of Khadi gift coupons for its 14,064 employees. The OIL agreed to gift Khadi coupons of Rs 5,000 to each of its 14,064 employees in its units across the nation. The employees, however, would be able to purchase Khadi and Village Industries products worth Rs 6,500 from the coupon of Rs 5,000. The coupons, which have already been delivered, can be redeemed throughout the year at all departmental sales outlets.


    In another order, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) have also ordered 800 gift coupons in denomination of Rs 1,000 for its 800 staff. These coupons have already been delivered and the 800 BEE staff can also purchase Khadi and Village Industries products worth Rs 1,300 from the coupon of Rs 1,000.


    KVIC Chairman Vinai Kumar Saxena said that such huge orders from government and PSUs will not only increase the income of the artisans but will certainly create more jobs by adding thousands of new artisans in KVIC's group. These orders would also pave way for KVIC for more convergence with different ministries and Public Sector Units.


    It may be noted that many government organisations like the Indian Railways, in the recent past, have shown its keen interest in promoting eco-friendly Khadi products. In January this year, in a quick response to the instructions issued by the Ministry of Railways to procure linen items from the KVIC â€“ the North Western Railways (Jaipur), North Central Railways (Allahabad) and Northern Railways (Delhi) had given order of approximately Rs 12.40 crore to the KVIC, for supply of Khadi duster and green/red flags.


    Later, on 25 th March 2019, the KVIC further bagged order to supply DT and duster worth Rs 1.25 crore from Rail Coach Factory at Kapurthala. On the same day, the KVIC received order to supply duster worth Rs 1.65 crore from North-West Railways Jaipur.


    In what may be a trendsetter for educational institutions, on 5 th March 2019, KVIC had bagged order of different varieties of Khadi Silk robes with Angawastram from Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) worth over Rs 21 lakh.
