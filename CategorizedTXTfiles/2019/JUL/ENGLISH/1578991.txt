      Scheme to Provide Loans Under Short Term Agriculture Loan
      Posted On: 16 JUL 2019 6:17PM by PIB Delhi


    In order to provide short term crop loans upto `3.00 lakh to farmers at a concessional interest rate of 7 per cent per annum, the Government of India in the Department of Agriculture Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) implements an interest subvention scheme which provides interest subvention of 2% per annum to lending institutions viz. Public Sector Banks (PSBs), Private Sector Commercial Banks (in respect of loans given by their rural and semi urban branches only), Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) and Cooperative Banks on use of their own resources. Besides, additional 3% incentive is given to the farmers for prompt repayment of the loan, thereby reducing the effective rate of interest to 4%.


    As reported by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) the number of farmers who have availed crop loans from Cooperative Banks and RRBs and benefited with 3% prompt repayment incentive under the scheme in Maharashtra during the last 3 years are given in following table:
