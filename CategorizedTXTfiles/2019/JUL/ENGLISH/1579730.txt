    To ensure effective enforcement of the provisions of the Child Labour Act and smooth implementation of the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme a separate online portal Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour (PENCIL) has been launched w.e.f. 26.9.2017. The Portal connects Central Government to State Government(s), District(s), all Project Societies and the General public. Further, online complaints regarding child labour can also be filed by anybody on the Pencil Portal. The complaint gets assigned to the concerned Nodal Officer automatically by the system for further necessary action.


    Of the 1010 complaints of child labour received on PENCIL, the District Nodal Officers have updated the status in respect of 361 complaints as resolved.


    This information was given by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar Union Minister of State (I/C) for Labour and Employment in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
