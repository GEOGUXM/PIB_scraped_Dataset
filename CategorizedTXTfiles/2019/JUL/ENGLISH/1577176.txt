    Government has, from time to time, appointed some prominent persons for specific assignments in government, keeping in view their specialized knowledge and expertise in the domain area. NITI Aayog, in its three year Action Agenda, and the Sectoral Group of Secretaries (SGoS) on Governance, in its report submitted in February, 2017, have recommended for induction of personnel in the middle and senior management level in the Government. Based on this, it has been decided, in principle, to appoint outside experts to 10 positions of Joint Secretary in identified Ministries/Departments and 40 positions at Deputy Secretary/Director level.


    Advertisement inviting applications from individuals for the post of Joint Secretary in ten identified Ministries/Departments was issued by DoPT. The entire selection process of the candidates was entrusted to Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). The UPSC, after conducting the selection process, has recommended nine individuals for appointment as Joint Secretary in nine identified Ministries/Departments.


    The appointment of outside experts was made through open advertisement and the selection and evaluation process was entrusted to the UPSC.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
