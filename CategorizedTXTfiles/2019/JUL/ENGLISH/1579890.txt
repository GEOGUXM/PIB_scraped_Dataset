    The Government is aware that some languages are identified as endangered languages. The Government of India has initiated a scheme known as “Protection and Preservation of Endangered Languages of India”. Under this scheme, the Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL), Mysore works on protection, preservation and documentation of all the mother tongues/ languages of India spoken by less than 10000 people. University Grants Commission (UGC) is also providing financial assistance for creation of centres for endangered languages at Central and State Universities to undertake research projects and thereby works towards preservation of endangered languages.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (I/c) of Culture and Tourism, Shri Prahlad Singh Patel in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
