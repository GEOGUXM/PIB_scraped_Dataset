For the year 2019-20, the incentive grant has been enhanced and an amount of Rs.158.26 crore has been earmarked for this purpose.


    The Central Government has set up various Commissions/Committees on police reforms and reviewed their recommendations from time to time to make police more efficient, effective, responsive to the needs of the people and accountable to the rule of law. The Supreme Court has also been monitoring the status of implementation of Police Reforms.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G. Kishan Reddy in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.
