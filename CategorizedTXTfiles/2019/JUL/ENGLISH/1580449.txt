    A Workshop on Police Verification Service Standards was organized by Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) at New Delhi.

    Police Verification services include verification for the purposes of issue of passport, employment, Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) for visas for certain countries and so on. Transparent and sturdy mechanism, especially through online system of application and payment will go a long way in delivery of police services.
