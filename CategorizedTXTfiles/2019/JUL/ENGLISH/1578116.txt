      Posted On: 10 JUL 2019 4:08PM by PIB Delhi


    Data on per capita consumption of total finished steel in the world (global average), and India for 2018 is given below which shows that India’s per capita steel consumption was lower than the global average during 2018-19.

    Per capita steel consumption of a country is directly proportional to its level of development. Developed countries have greater per capita steel consumption as steel is used in construction, public infrastructure such as roads, rails, ports etc and by steel intensive industries such as ship building, automobiles, engineering goods, white goods, etc.


    With more focus on housing for all under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, highways, rail network, piped water for all households etc., India’s per capita steel consumption is increasing every year.


    In order to prevent low quality steel from being sold in the Indian market, Ministry of Steel has implemented quality control orders on 53 steel and steel products which is applicable for both domestic production as well as imports. The Steel Quality Control Orders are implemented in the public interest for protection of human, animal and plant, safety of environment, prevention of unfair trade practices and national security. The imports of low quality steel for the year 2018-19 has decreased by 15% as compared to previous year (Annexure ).


    This information was given by the Union Minister for steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
