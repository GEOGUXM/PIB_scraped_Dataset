    Indian cuisine encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines native to India. Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic group and occupations, these cuisines vary significantly from each other and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables and fruits. Almost all states have their unique recipes.


    Traditional foods are often based on a holistic approach to nutrition, as required by local people. Such food is prepared with locally available ingredients and found to have its own therapeutic and nutritional benefits.


    Government has undertaken following steps to promote Indian food culture:

     1. State Governments and other stakeholders are encouraged to hold food stalls in tourism related activities like Bharat Parv and Paryatan Parv etc.
     2. Financial support is given to private organizers for holding street food stalls facilitating tourists.
     3. To promote local and regional food, government has created guidelines for organizing safe and hygienic food festivals.
     4. Guidelines for declaration of clean street food hub have been framed includingupgrading of infrastructure of existing food streets of the country to popularize and promote local and regional cuisines.
     5. Launch of book focusing on regional cuisine of India.

    This information was given by the Minister of State (I/c) of Culture and Tourism, Shri Prahlad Singh Patel in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
