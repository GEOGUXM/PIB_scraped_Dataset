    Some of the major indicator wise reforms undertaken by the Government towards easing the business environment in the country are as under:


    (i) Starting A Business:

     1. The minimum capital requirement for public and private company has been eliminated under the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2015.
     2. Introduced a single form SPICe (Simplified Proforma for Incorporating Company electronically) by merging five different applications in it i.e. Name reservation, Company incorporation, Director Identification Number (DIN), Permanent Account Number (PAN) and the Tax Deduction/Collection Account Number (TAN).
     3. Introduced an e-form AGILE (Application for registration of the Goods and Services Tax Identification Number (GSTIN), Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) registration plus Employees’ Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) registration). Any applicant, if he wants to register for any of these bodies, can fill in e-form AGILE and get registration at the time of company incorporation itself. This form enables a user to apply for GST, EPF and ESI registration with the SPICe form.
     4. Launch of a new and simplified web based service i.e. R.U.N. (Reserve Unique Name) for reserving a name. This has also removed the requirement to use a Digital Signature Certificate (DSC) during name reservation.
     5. Incorporation fee reduced to zero for companies with authorized capital up to INR 15 lakhs
     6. The requirement to issue a physical PAN card has been eliminated. Additionally, PAN and TAN are mentioned in the Certificate of Incorporation (CoI) which is considered as a sufficient proof for PAN and TAN.
     7. Online and common registration for EPFO & ESIC is provided on ShramSuvidha Portal.
     8. Registrations under Mumbai Shops & Establishments Act are provided in real time without any cost and any inspection
     9. Eliminated the requirement of bank account details for GST registration

    (ii) Dealing with Construction Permits:

     1. An online single window system has been introduced in Delhi (By Municipal Corporations in Delhi) and Mumbai (By Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai) integrating internal and external departments, removing requirement of visiting them individually.
     2. Unified building bye-laws 2016 have been introduced in Delhi.
     3. Deemed approvals have been introduced in Delhi, if approvals are not granted within defined timelines.
     4. Risk based classification of buildings has been introduced for fast tracking building plan approval, inspection and grant of occupancy-cum-completion certificate.
     5. Requirement of submitting notarized certificates or affidavits for building plan approval has been replaced with e-undertaking in Delhi.
     6. Multiple inspections at completion stage have been replaced by single joint inspection in Delhi.
     7. Road cutting and restoration for water and sewer connections have been simplified.

    (iii) Getting Electricity:

     1. Procedures for internal wiring inspection by the Electrical Inspectorate (in Delhi) have been eliminated.
     2. In Delhi, service line charges have been capped to INR 25,000/- in electrified areas for Low Tension loads up to 150 KW.
     3. Time taken by the utility to carry out external connection works has been reduced in Delhi.
     4. Getting Credit :
     5. Secured creditors are paid first during business liquidation, and hence have priority over other claims such as labor and tax.
     6. Paying Taxes:
     7. 17 indirect Central and State taxes have been replaced with a single indirect tax, Goods and Service Tax (GST), for the entire country. The previous sales taxes including the central sales tax, CENVAT, state VAT and the service tax have been merged into the GST. Unification of these taxes will reduce the cascading effect of taxes and make taxes paid on inputs creditable to a higher percentage.
     8. Corporate income tax has been reduced from 30% to 25% for companies with a turnover up to INR 250 crore.
     9. Electronic System for payment of Social Security Contributions has been introduced enabling easier return payment.
    10. Making payment of EPF has been made mandatory electronically.
    11. Administrative charges on The Employees' Provident Funds Scheme, 1952 (EPFS) have been reduced in March 2017 from 0.85% to 0.65% of the monthly pay. The Employees’ Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI) administrative charges of 0.01% have been removed.
    12. Trading Across Borders:
    13. Time and cost to export and import has been reduced through various initiatives, including the implementation of electronic sealing of containers, upgradation of port infrastructure and allowing electronic submission of supporting documents with digital signatures.
    14. Enhancement of risk-based inspections for both imports and exports, whereby only about 5% of goods are physically inspected.
    15. Advance Bill of Entry has been adopted which allows importers to start the process of customs clearance before the arrival of the vessel.
    16. Equipment on the NhavaSheva Port in Mumbai has been upgraded by adding 15 new Rubber Tyre Gantry Cranes. The Phase 1 of the Fourth Container Terminal at the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, with an additional annual capacity of 2,400,000 TEUs, was completed in February 2018.
