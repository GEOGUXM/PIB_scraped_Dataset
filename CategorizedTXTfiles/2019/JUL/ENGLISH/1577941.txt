      Posted On: 09 JUL 2019 4:16PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government has implemented Maharatna, Navratna and Miniratna scheme for Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) under which the Boards of these CPSEs have been delegated powers, inter-alia, to enter technology joint ventures or strategic alliances and to obtain by purchase or other arrangement technology and know-how as per Government guidelines. Further, ‘R&D, Innovation, Technology up-gradation’ has been included as a non-financial parameter under the system of Memorandum of Understanding for CPSEs (except for CPSEs in the financial sector) with a weight of up to 10% in order to provide focus on efforts of management of CPSEs in this regard.


    All CPSEs function under the administrative jurisdiction of concerned Ministry/Departments. The Board of Directors of a CPSE is responsible for regular review of performance of the concerned CPSE and to decide on steps to be taken for enhancing output/productivity of the company as per its operational needs and business plans with the approval of the competent authority. The concerned administrative Ministry/Department also undertakes periodic review of performance of CPSEs under their respective jurisdiction to facilitate policy interventions required for enhancing output/productivity of concerned CPSE(s).


    This information was given by the Minister of Heavy Industries & Public Enterprises, Arvind Ganpat Sawant, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
