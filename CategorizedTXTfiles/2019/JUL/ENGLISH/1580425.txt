      Posted On: 26 JUL 2019 4:31PM by PIB Delhi


    Under Skill India Mission, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) imparts employable skills to the youth through long term and short term training. The Ministry is implementing its flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY 1.0), launched in 2015, to provide employable skills to the youth of the nation. Under PMKVY 1.0, a total of 19.85 lakh candidates were trained. Owing to the success of PMKVY 1.0, the scheme was re-launched in October, 2016 called PMKVY 2.0 (2016-2020) on pan-India basis with a target to provide skilling to one crore people under Short Term Training (STT), Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) and Special Project (SP) across the country over four years (2016-2020). As on 12.06.2019, a total of 52.12 lakh candidates have been trained under PMKVY 2.0. The state-wise details of candidates trained and placed under PMKVY 1.0 and PMKVY 2.0 is placed at Annexure I.


    Long Term Training is provided through Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs). There are 14494 ITIs with a training capacity of 33.98 lakh. The state-wise detail of the trainees trained through ITIs is placed at Annexure II.


    Employment generation together with improving employability of the youth is the priority of the government. Therefore, most Skill Development programs lay emphasis on placements. The PMKVY 2.0 (2016-2020) mandates Training Providers (TPs) to facilitate placements of certified candidates. TPs need to organize Placement/Rozgar Melas every six months with support from the Sector Skill Councils and to ensure the participation of local industry along with awareness building in aspiring youth. National Skill Development Corporation, PPP company under MSDE has also empanelled placement partners, with the objective of ensuring placement opportunities to PMKVY certified candidates not placed by TPs within 90 days from date of certification.


    Further, as per the Common Norms, the reimbursement of 20% of training cost to training centres is made only after wage employment or self employment is assured to at least 70% of the certified candidates. There is also a provision to provide post placement support to candidates belonging from special areas/ special groups in order to enable the newly skilled persons to settle into their jobs/vocations.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri. R. K. Singh in the Rajya Sabha today.
