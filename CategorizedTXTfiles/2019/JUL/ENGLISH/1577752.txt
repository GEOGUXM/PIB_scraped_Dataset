    There were no survivors in the AN-32 aircraft crash. A Court of Inquiry has been ordered to probe into the cause of the crash.


    The families of the victims were initially informed that the aircraft was missing. They were also informed about the rescue efforts undertaken. Once the wreckage was located and it was confirmed that there were no survivors, the same was then informed to the families of the victims. A team of officers is in regular touch with the affected families.
