      Posted On: 11 JUL 2019 3:34PM by PIB Delhi


    Since The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 is comprehensive, Government of India is currently not proposing any amendment.


    Safety and security of women in the country is of utmost priority for the Government. All Ministries of Government of India and State/UT governments have been requested to organize workshops and awareness programmes in their Departments/Offices for sensitizing employees about matters pertaining to sexual harassment of women at workplace and related legal provisions and redressal mechanisms.


    The Ministry of Women and Child Development issues advisories from time to time to all State Governments/UT Administrations, Ministries/Departments of Government of India and leading business associations including Associated Chambers of Commerce & Industry of India (ASSOCHAM), Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) etc., to ensure effective implementation of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.


    Apart from the above, the Ministry of Women and Child Development has identified resource institutions to provide capacity building programmes i.e. trainings, workshops, etc. on the issue of prevention, prohibition and redressal of sexual harassment of women at workplaces.


    This information was given by the Minister of Women and Child Development, Smriti Zubin Irani, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
