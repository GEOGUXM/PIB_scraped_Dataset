    Glass fibres and composites are produced and marketed in India. Other modified polymer new synthetic fibres / filaments which are being potentially developed in the country are: flame retardant Poly Ethylene Terephthalate (PET), Antimicrobial PET, HOLLOW PET, Trilobal PET, Conjugate staple PET, Moisture management PET filament, Ultraviolet Resistant Polypropylene. Basic research is being conducted in developing fibre from indigenously available Himalayan plant sources such as flax and nettle.


    Government is in discussion with technical textiles manufacturers in Japan for possible investment by Japanese textile manufacturers in India through joint ventures and technological collaborations. A high level official delegation had visited Japan in February, 2019, in which some of the leading manufacturers like M/s Teijin Frontier Corporation, Japan expressed their interest in investing in the field of textiles manufacturing in India. The Indian Technical Textiles Association (ITTA), which was also a part of the high level Indian delegation to Japan is working towards business-to-business partnership and joint venture proposals with their Japanese counterparts.
