    Inadequate qualified manpower availability is one of the major problem faced in the mental healthcare service delivery. However, with a view to augment the availability of qualified manpower in field of mental health, the Government, under NMHP, is implementing manpower development schemes for establishment of Centres of Excellence and strengthening/ establishment of Post Graduate (PG) Departments in mental health specialties. Till date, support has been provided for establishment of 25 Centres of Excellence and strengthening/ establishment of 47 Post Graduate (PG) Departments in mental health specialties in the country.


    The Government is also augmenting the availability of manpower to deliver mental healthcare services in the underserved areas of the country by providing online training courses to various categories of general healthcare medical and para medical professionals through the Digital Academies established at the three Central Mental Health Institutes namely National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bengaluru, Lokopriya Gopinath Bordoloi Regional Institute of Mental Health, Tezpur, Assam, and Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi.


    The working of National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore is regularly reviewed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Besides, the Standing Finance Committee, Governing Body and Institute Body of NIMHANS also monitor and review the functioning of the Institute and consider proposals of the Institute for initiating various developmental activities.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
