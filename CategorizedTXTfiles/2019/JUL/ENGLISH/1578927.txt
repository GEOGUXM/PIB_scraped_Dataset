      Posted On: 16 JUL 2019 4:38PM by PIB Delhi


    As per National Family Health Survey –IV (2015-16), birth by Caesarean Section (%) in private health facility is 40.9% which is higher than public health facility where it is 11.9%. As per WHO statement (April 2015) “at population level, caesarean section rates higher than 10% are not associated with reductions in maternal and new-born mortality rates”. In order to curb unnecessary C - section rate a communication vide OM M.12015/182/2015-MCH has been sent to the Principal Secretaries and Mission Directors of all States and UTs urging them to share the WHO statement with all the Obstetricians and Gynaecologists working in public health facilities in their respective States.


    Government of India also has written vide OM M.12015/182/2015-MCH to Federation of Obstetrical and Gynaecologists in India (FOGSI) to share the WHO statement among the Obstetricians and Gynaecologists under the umbrella of FOGSI.


    All CGHS empanelled hospitals are directed to display the information regarding ratio of deliveries by caesarean section vis-à-vis normal deliveries vide OM Z15025/2017.


    Under “LaQshya”- Labour room & maternity OT Quality Improvement Initiative, Caesarean section audit has been implemented in all certified public health facilities to ensure that Caesarean sections are undertaken judiciously in only those cases requiring such surgical interventions.
