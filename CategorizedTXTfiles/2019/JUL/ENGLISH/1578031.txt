      Posted On: 09 JUL 2019 8:23PM by PIB Delhi


    The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) vide its circular on ‘National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) and Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems – Waiver of charges’ dated 11.06.2019, has decided that with effect from July 1, 2019, processing charges and time varying charges levied on banks by RBI for outward transactions undertaken using the RTGS system, as also the processing charges levied by RBI for transactions processed in NEFT system would be waived by the Reserve Bank.


    The banks are also advised by RBI to pass on the benefits to their customers for undertaking transactions using RTGS and NEFT systems. This waiver of processing and time varying charges by RBI on banks will reduce the cost of RTGS and NEFT transactions and will give fillip to digital fund movement.


    There is an increase in NEFT and RTGS transactions during the last three years as illustrated in the table given below (in crore) :
