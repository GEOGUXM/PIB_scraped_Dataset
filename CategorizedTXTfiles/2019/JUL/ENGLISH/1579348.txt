    The data indicating the number of cases registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 during the last three years in North Eastern Region (NER) is at Annexure-I .


    As per the information provided by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), a total of 34,449, 34,505 and 36,022 cases were registered under POCSO Act, 2012 during the years 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively, accounting for increase of 0.2% in 2015 over 2014 and 4.4% in 2016 over 2015. The Government had introduced the POCSO Act 2012, as a special law to protect children from sexual abuse and exploitation.


    A provision already exists under Section 28 of the POCSO Act, 2012 to designate Special Court for each district for speedy trial to try the offences.


    Section 43 of the POCSO Act, 2012 provides that the Central Government and every State Government shall take all measures to give wide publicity to the provisions of the Act. In accordance with this, the Government has taken various steps from time to time to create awareness of the provisions of the POCSO Act through electronic and print media, consultations, workshops and training programmes with stakeholders concerned. Further, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCRs) are also mandated to monitor the implementation of the POCSO Act, 2012.
