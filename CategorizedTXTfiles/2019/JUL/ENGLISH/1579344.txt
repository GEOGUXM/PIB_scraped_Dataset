      Posted On: 18 JUL 2019 4:32PM by PIB Delhi


    The objective of the scheme “Infrastructure and Technology Support” is to setup a permanent marketing infrastructure in big towns/ metropolitan cities to provide direct marketing facilities to the handicrafts artisans/handloom weavers.


    The scheme is implemented through State Handicrafts/Handlooms Development Corporations/Tourism Development Corporations/ Urban Local Bodies with sufficient financial resources and organizational capacity to implement the project.


    The financial ceiling for Urban Haat is Rs. 300 lakh for each unit. 80% of the admissible amount is borne by the Office of the Development Commissioner (Handicrafts) and 20% contributed by the implementing agency.


    No proposals have been received from Government of Uttar Pradesh to establish Urban Haats in various districts including Moradabad. At present six Urban Haats are in Uttar Pradesh at Varanasi, Agra, Bareilly, Rampur, Jhansi and Ayodhya.


    This information was given by the Union Minister of Textiles, Smriti Zubin Irani, in written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
