      Annual Budget for Eklavya Model Residential Schools
      Posted On: 11 JUL 2019 5:05PM by PIB Delhi


    The component of Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS) was part of the activities funded through “Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution”. During 2018-19 a separate scheme for EMRS was formulated for which a token provision has been made during 2019-20. Therefore, in the current year, EMRS are funded through “Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution”. Allocations for EMRS are demand driven keeping in view the number of students enrolled in the schools and approval for new schools.


    
    Utilization of funds is regularly monitored through Physical Progress Reports, Utilisation Certificates, review meetings at various levels and field visits by officers from the Ministry. All justified demands for funds from State Governments have been met through available budget.


    
    This information was given by Union Minister of Tribal Affairs Shri Arjun Munda in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
