    A survey for skill gap analysis in textile and clothing sector of India was conducted by the Textiles Committee in May 2018. The survey estimated additional employment to the tune of 62.12 lakh in organised sector by 2020. The study also projected skilling requirement for 30.56 lakh persons in which 23.89 Lakh was for Apparel Sector.


    With a view to address the skilled manpower requirements of textile sector, the Ministry had been implementing Integrated Skill Development Scheme (ISDS) from 2010-11 to 2017-18. The scheme was implemented on pan India basis. Under the scheme, 11.14 lakh persons were trained out of which 8.43 lakh persons were given employment.


    In order to continue the endeavour of the Ministry in addressing the skill gap in the textile industry, the Government has approved a new scheme titled Samarth-Scheme for Capacity Building in Textile Sector (SCBTS) for the entire value chain of textile sector, excluding Spinning and Weaving in the organized sector, for a period of three years from 2017-18 to 2019-20 with an outlay of Rs. 1300 crore. The objectives of the scheme inter alia include providing demand driven, placement oriented National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF) compliant skilling programmes to incentivize and supplement the efforts of the industry in creating jobs in the organised textile and related sectors and to provide skilling and skill-upgradation in the traditional sectors. 10.00 lakh persons will be trained under the scheme.
