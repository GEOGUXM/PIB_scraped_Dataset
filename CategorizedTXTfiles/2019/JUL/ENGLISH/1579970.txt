    The schemes for creation of border infrastructure works, on Indo-Bangladesh Border, like fence, road, floodlight and BOPs are in progress. Border guarding forces conduct regular patrolling, lay nakas and establish observation posts and carry out anti tunneling exercise to stop illegal infiltration.


    However, some illegal migrants are able to enter in a clandestine and surreptitious manner, mainly due to difficult riverine terrain in parts of international border with Bangladesh which are not amenable to physical fencing. As such, the accurate number of infiltrators is not available. However the details of infiltrators who were apprehended along Indo-Bangladesh border during the last 5 years w.e.f. 01.01.2014 to 31.12.2018 and current year up to 30.06.2019 is given below:-
