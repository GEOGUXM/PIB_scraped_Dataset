    Merchandise Exports


    The above decline inexports in June 2019 is due in large part to a base effect of an extraordinarily good month in June 2018 impacting growth figures for June 2019. While the average exports in the month of June have been USD 22-23 billion since 2015-16, the exports in June 2018 were relatively quite high at USD 27.70 billion.


    The negative growth in June 2019 is also consistent with certain global trends, which have impacted India’s exportsin recent months. The World Bank in its Global Economic Prospects (June 2019) has projected weakening of global trade in 2019. Global trade is projected to grow at 2.6% this year – a full percentage point below their previous forecast.


    Various major economies of the world have also shown negative export growth in recent months. As per the latest WTO data available for April 2019, there is negative export growth in Japan(-5.88),European Union (-4.30), China(-2.75), USA(-2.12)


    The major commodities, which, contributed towards this decline in June 2019 have been Petroleum products (-32.85%), Rice (-28.05%), Cotton yarn/Fabrics/made-ups (-19.73%), Gems and Jewellery (-10.67%), Readymade garments (-9.18%), Organic & inorganic chemicals (-8.17%), and Engineering goods (-2.65%),


    Factors influencing the decline for some major commodities are:


    Temporary shutdown of ONGC Mangalore Petrochemical Limited (from 17/04/2019 to 28/06/2019) for maintenance., has adversely impacted exports of petroleum products. Jamnagar refinery also experienced a routine maintenance related disruption in June 2019, which is likely to abate by mid-July 2019. The fall in the global Brent price ($/bbl) by 15.81% in June 2019 vis-à-vis June 2018 as per data available from World Bank, is also a factor in the declining value of petroleum product exports.


    Engineering goods have been affected because of a fall in global prices of steel.


    During this period exports to UAE (-) 15.31 %, China (-) 14.09 % and Hong Kong (-) 9.68 % have shown significant decline.


    Department of Commerce is pro-actively pursuing an export promotion strategy involving conscious engagement with the EPCs and exporters to quickly address domestic and overseas constraints impacting exports.


    A special initiative has been underway with respect to China and the US in light of opportunities offered by their trade dispute.


    Merchandise Imports
