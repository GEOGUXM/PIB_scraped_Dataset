    The Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman said that Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G) aims to achieve the objective of “Housing for All” by 2020. Presenting the Union Budget 2019-20 in the Lok Sabha today, she said that a total of 1.54 crore rural homes have been completed in the last five years and in the second phase of PMAY-G, from 2019-22, 1.95 crore houses are proposed to be provided to the eligible beneficiaries. The houses will be provided with amenities like toilets, electricity and LPG connections.


    On the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) , the Finance Minister said “PMGSY-III envisages to upgrade 1,25,000 kms of road length over the next five years, with an estimated cost of Rs. 80,250 crore”. She said that to accelerate the speed of achieving universal connectivity of eligible habitations, the completion target was advanced from 2022 to 2019 and it is heartening to note that all weather connectivity has now been provided to over 97% of such habitations. This was made possible by maintaining a high pace of road construction of 130 to 135 km per day in the last 1000 days. She added that committed to the agenda of sustainable development, 20,000 kms of PMGSY roads have been built using Green Technology, Waste Plastic and Cold Mix Technology, thereby reducing carbon footprint.


    Speaking about the Ujjwala and Saubhagya Yojana , the Finance Minister said that they have transformed the lives of every rural family and by 2020, the 75 th year of India’s independence every single rural family will have electricity and a clean cooking facility. Household access to clean cooking gas has seen an unprecedented expansion, through provision of more than 7 crore LPG connections. All villages, and almost 100% households across the country have been provided with electricity. Smt. Sitharaman assured the nation that every single rural family, except those who are unwilling to take the connection will have an electricity and a clean cooking facility.
