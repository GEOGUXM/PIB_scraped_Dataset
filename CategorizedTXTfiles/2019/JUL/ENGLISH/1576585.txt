Patton today called on Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS, PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh and discussed various State related development projects with him


    
    During the meeting, Shri Patton conveyed his thanks to the Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for having made the central funding assistance to 100% under North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme (NESIDS), instead of earlier 90:10 ratio under NLCPR. He said that Nagaland being far flung and developing state, will get immensely benefited from this decision.

He said, a decision to this effect had already been taken and conveyed by the Ministry of DoNER to State Government of Nagaland last year and it was only the release of funds which was pending. He further brought to the notice of DoNER Minister a communique received from the Ministry of DONER which had asked the State government that suitable projects falling under the category of totally damaged/washed away, within the ceiling, may be identified for rebuilding and proposing the same for sanction.


    
    Shri Patton said that Nagaland was on the path of development and was confident that under the leadership of Prime Minister it will usher in a new area of development.
