      Import Duty on Apple
      Posted On: 10 JUL 2019 4:50PM by PIB Delhi


    The basic customs duty on fresh apple is 50%. Recently, there has been no increase on Most Favoured Nation (MFN) rate of duty on fresh apple. However, in June, 2019, the Government imposed additional duty of 20% (above MFN rate) on goods originating or exported from the United States of America.


    There is no proposal at this stage to mix 5% apple juice in all the beverages.


    This information was given by the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
