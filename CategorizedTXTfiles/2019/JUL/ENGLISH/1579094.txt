      Shortage of Pilots in Air Force
      Posted On: 17 JUL 2019 3:33PM by PIB Delhi


    Adequate number of following aircrafts are being used for imparting training to Indian Air Force (IAF) pilots:

      * Basic Trainer Aircraft;
      * Intermediate Jet Trainer; and
      * Advance Jet Trainer

    The available strength of pilots in the IAF is sufficient to meet the current operational requirements.


    Every year, the IAF participates in a number of career fairs/exhibitions, releases advertisements in newspapers/television and conducts numerous lectures in schools and colleges to motivate the target group.


    This information was given by Raksha Rajya Mantri Shri Shripad Naik in a written reply to Shri Ramcharan Bohra in Lok Sabha today.
