    The recruitment to the posts of class III (now Group ‘C’) has not been banned. With the acceptance of the recommendations of the 6th Central Pay Commission, Group ‘D’ posts have been merged with Group ‘C’ posts.


    Recruitment to Group ‘C’ posts, including erstwhile Group ‘D’ posts in Government Departments/ Ministries is a continuous process. Vacancies are caused in Government sector due to retirement, resignation, death and/or new creation of posts. Such vacancies are regular in nature and the recruiting agencies like Staff Selection Commission, Railway Recruitment Boards, etc. are regularly conducting examinations for recruitment to such posts.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
