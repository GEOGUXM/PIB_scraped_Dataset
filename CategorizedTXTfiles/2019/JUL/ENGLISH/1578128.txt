    The important measures taken by Government to make payment of pension to EPF pensioners in a hassle-free environment are as follows:

     1. The payment of pension is released electronically directly to pensionerâ€™s Bank Accounts.
     2. The pensioners can submit life certificate online through Jeevan Pramaan/Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance (UMANG) App.

    This information was given by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Minister of State (I/C) for Labour and Employment in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
