    The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing Short Term and Long Term Training programs for skilling/re-skilling and up-skilling of the youth. The major programs include namely Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY); Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS); National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS); Craftsman Training Scheme (CTS) etc.


    Under its flagship program PMKVY, one crore people are to be trained under Short Term Training (STT), Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) and Special Project (SP) programmes over period from 2016 to 2020. The scheme has two components viz. Centrally Sponsored Centrally Managed (CSCM) being implemented by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and Centrally Sponsored State Managed (CSSM) being implemented by State Skill Development Missions (SSDMs) of the States/ UTs. The achievements of the PMKVY as on 12.06.2019 are in Annexure I.


    The Jan Shikshan Sansthan scheme which supports voluntary agencies for adult education and skill development is an initiative in the direction of realizing the unique demographic potential of urban slums and rural India. In the year 2018-19, there were 247 JSS operational in 27 states and 2 union territories in India. Total training capacity of JSS during 2018 – 2019 was 3.72 lakh beneficiaries per year. MSDE has planned to increase the training capacity to 4.82 lakh beneficiaries per year by adding 20% more capacity to the existing JSSs and adding new JSSs in 83 new identified districts in the year 2019-20.


    The Government has also launched the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) to provide on the job training to the youth and to enhance their employability. The aim is to increase the engagement of apprentices to 50 lakh by financial year 2019-20. About 3.78 lakh, 4.00 lakh and 4.45 lakh candidates have undergone apprenticeship training during Financial Year 2016-17, 2017-18 & 2018-19 respectively.


    Under the Long Term Training Program, the Directorate General of Training is implementing the Craftsman Training Scheme through ITIs to ensure availability of skilled manpower in different trades in industry. There are 14494 ITIs (Govt. 2876 + Private 11,618) with seating capacity of 33.98 lakh, imparting training in more than 136 trades. Some popular trades are Electrician, Fitter, Machinist, Welder, and Mechanic Motor Vehicle etc. The target trainees are 10th class pass.


    The funds allocated under the three Centrally Sponsored Schemes of the Ministry are given at Annexure II. The funds are released to States/UTs as per their request driven by the States absorptive capacity and utilisation of fund.


    The Ministry has prepared plans for scaling up the implementation of its various programs which includes encouraging greater participation of industry in skilling ecosystem through industry led – Sector Skill Councils; alignment of qualification with National Skill Qualification Framework to make training industry relevant; encouraging industries to participate as training providers to run the high employment potential courses through appropriate accreditation and affiliation framework ; Training Centers (TCs)/ Training Providers (TPs) to have dedicated mentorship-cum-placement cells for industry linkage and placement of candidates; organisation of Placement/Rozgar Melas every six months with support from the Sector Skill Councils (SSCs); incentivizing TCs/TPs for facilitating placement of the trained candidates. Additionally, post placement support of Rs. 1500 per month per trainee is applicable for special group (women candidates and persons with disability) and special areas (LWE, North East region and J&K) for 2 or 3 month post training depending on placement within or outside the district of the domicile of the candidate; Strengthening of regulatory infrastructure and Training of trainers in 33 National Skill Training Institutes.
