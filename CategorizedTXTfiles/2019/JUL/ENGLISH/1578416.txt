      Posted On: 11 JUL 2019 6:20PM by PIB Delhi


    Keeping in mind the need to modernise the jute mills by increasing their productivity and to replace the old machines by new and technologically advanced machines, National Jute Board (NJB) has been implementing schemes for modernization of jute industry. The scheme has been instrumental in bringing new investment to the industry.


    The ISAPM scheme has been launched in 2013 with an incentive @20% of the cost of machineries to jute mills and 30% to the MSME â€“JDP units. During 2014-15 to 2018-19, capital subsidy amounting to Rs. 4971.19 lakhhas been released to jute mills and JDP units.


    Ten composite jute manufacturing units have been establishedin the last five years.


    The effective installed capacity of the industry is around 16.5 lakh metric tonne and around 11.5 lakh metric tonnes of jute goods is produced in the country. The difference in the production and capacity is due to labour related issues including shortage of labour.


    This information was given by the Union Minister of Textiles, Smriti Zubin Irani, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
