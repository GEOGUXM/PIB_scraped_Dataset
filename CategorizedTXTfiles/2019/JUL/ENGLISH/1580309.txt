    In reply to a question about how the navigability of National Waterways in the country is monitored, Shri Mansukh Mandaviya, the Minister of State for Shipping (I/C) and Chemical & Fertilizers informed that


    this is done through regular hydrographic surveys and channel inspection by regional and sub regional offices of Inland Waterways Authority of India. Fortnightly hydrographic surveys are conducted to determine the available depth and possible shoal formations in the channels to determine safe navigability throughout the year. A constant vigil is kept on the river regime behavior and accordingly appropriate river conservancy measures are taken to ensure fairways for safe movement of vessels. Based on the observation during channel inspection and hydrographic surveys, River Notices are issued and placed on Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) website with details of Least Available Depth (LAD), clearances at bridge structures etc. along with any specific information to be conveyed to shippers to assist them for safe transportation of cargo on the National Waterways.


    Shri Mandaviya further informed that River Information System (RIS) which aims to streamline the exchange of information between waterway operators and users to optimize traffic and transport processes in inland navigation, has been commissioned and is operational between Haldia to Farakka (Phase-I) and Farakka to Patna (Phase-II) stretches of NW-1 (Ganga).


    Giving details about the status of NW, the Minister informed that there are 13 operational National Waterways in the country at present and 72.31 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) of cargo was transported on these NWs during 2018-19. NW-1 (Ganga), NW-2 (Brahmaputra) , NW-3 (West Coast Canal from Kottapuram to Kollam along with Udyogmandal and Champakara Canals) have already been developed with fairway, navigational aids, jetties and mechanized terminals. In addition, NW-10 (Amba), NW-27 (Cumberjua), NW- 68 (Mandovi), NW-73 (Narmada), NW-83 (Rajpuri Creek), NW-85 (Revadanda Creek - Kundalika River System), NW-91 (Shastri river-Jaigad creek system), NW- 97 (Sunderbans), NW-100 (Tapi) and NW-111 (Zuari) are also operational
