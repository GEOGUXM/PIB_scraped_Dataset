      Posted On: 19 JUL 2019 4:29PM by PIB Delhi


    In view of the contribution of Doordarshan towards dissemination of accurate information about policies and programmes of government, acceleration of socio-economic change, promotion of national integration and stimulation of scientific temper, it is mandated that all Cable TV Networks should carry DD channels. However, it is noticed that the same is not being done by several cable operators, which is in contravention of existing rules.


    It has accordingly been decided that an Affidavit be sought from both existing MSOs as well as fresh applicants that they are carrying all 24 DD Channels, besides Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha TV channels, on their TV network. The same has to be submitted within one month of issue of notice.


    Format of the Affidavit may be accessed at www.mib.gov.in , www.digitalindiamib.com and also under the procedure for submission of applications online on the portal www.broadcastseva.gov.in .
