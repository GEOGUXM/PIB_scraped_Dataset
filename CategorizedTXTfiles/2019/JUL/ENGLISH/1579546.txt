    As per National Crime Records Bureau which is available up to 2016, the details of State/UT-wise cases registered under crime against women and crime against children during 2014- 2016 are at Annexure-I.


    The Ministry recognizes that incidence of crime against women cannot be controlled unless mindsets of people, in general, are made to change. There are many reasons behind increasing crimes against women such as unequal economic, social and political status of women, patriarchal mindsets etc.


    ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibilities towards maintenance of law and order and protection of life and property of citizens rest primarily with State Governments. The State Governments are competent to deal with such offences under the extant provisions of laws. However, safety and security of women and children in the country is of utmost priority for the Government.


    The Ministry of Women and Child Development has been administering various special laws relating to women such as ‘The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005’, ‘The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961’, ‘The Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986’, ‘The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013’, and ‘The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006’. India is signatory to United Nations Convention on Right of Child (UNCRC) since 1992. In adherence to its commitment to ensure child rights, the Government has framed the National Policy for Children 2013 and National Plan of Action 2016. It has also framed Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2015, The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 and The Commissions for Protection of Child Right (CPCR) Act, 2005.


    The Juvenile Justice Act mandates a security net of service delivery structures to provide Institutional or non-institutional care for children in need of care and protection and children in conflict with law. The POCSO Act acknowledges various kind of child sex abuse and provides stringent punishment for the same. It provides for child friendly procedures at every stage of trial and stipulates mandatory reporting of the crime. Criminal Law (Amendment), Act 2013 was enacted for effective legal deterrence against sexual offences. Further, ‘The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018’ have also been enacted making the punishment for offences like rape more stringent by including death penalty for rape of a girl below the age of 12 years. The Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009 mandates right of children to free and compulsory education. The CPCR Act, 2005 mandates establishment of Statutory Commissions at centre and State levels to protect, defend and promote child rights in the country. National Commission and all the State Commissions have been set up under the said Act.


    The Government of India has set up a non-lapsable corpus of fund under Nirbhaya Fund Framework for enhancing safety and security of women. The Ministry of Women and Child Development is also implementing Schemes including the Scheme of ‘One Stop Centres’ for violence affected women, the Scheme of ‘Women Helpline’ and the Scheme of ‘Mahila Police Volunteers’ under the Nirbhaya Fund Framework.


    The Ministry has also launched various programs and Schemes for reducing gender related disparities. The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), has been launched for promoting a better enabling environment by providing cash incentives for improved health and nutrition to pregnant and lactating mothers. The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) is a comprehensive program to address the declining Child Sex Ratio (CSR) and related issues of empowerment of girls and women over a life-cycle continuum with coordinated efforts of Ministries of Health and Family Welfare and Human Resource Development with Ministry of Women and Child Development. Mahila Shakti Kendra scheme empowers rural women through community participation through involvement of Student Volunteers. Ujjawala scheme is targeted for rescue, rehabilitation and re-integration of women and child victims of trafficking.


    Further, the Government recognizes that the incidence of crime against women and children cannot be controlled unless mindset of people, in general, undergoes a positive change. Therefore, The Government of India conducts awareness generation programs and publicity campaigns on various laws relating to women and their rights through workshops, cultural events, seminars, trainings, advertisements in print and electronic media etc.


    The Ministry is also implementing umbrella ICDS scheme which comprehensively addresses the need for child development and protection. Samagra Shiksha Scheme has been launched by the Government to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education. National Child Labour Project is being implemented to eliminate all forms of child labour.
