    The Union Budget 2019-20 presented today by Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman, lays down a vision for India becoming a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2024-25. Investment-driven growth and employment generation form the cornerstone of this vision.


    The Tax Policy Measures in this direction are as under:

      * Scope of domestic transfer pricing provisions was restricted only for transactions between enterprises having profit-linked deductions.
      * Pass through status was provided to Category I & II Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs).
      * The time period for carry forward of MAT credit was increased from 10 to 15 years.

    Above initiatives were proposed as part of a framework for kick-starting the virtuous cycle of domestic and foreign investments. “We need to invest heavily in infrastructure, in digital economy and on job creation in small and medium firms”, the Finance Minister stated. The common man’s life changed through MUDRA loans to help him do his business.


    Government has announced its intention to invest Rs.100 lakh crores in infrastructure over the next five years, the Finance Minister stated. The massive push given to all forms of physical connectivity through Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, industrial corridors, dedicated freight corridors, Bhartamala and Sagarmala projects, Jal Marg Vikas and UDAN Schemes would give the required boost to the economy.


    Measures to enhance the Sources of Capital for Infrastructure Financing:

      * A Credit Guarantee Enhancement Corporation to be set up in 2019-2020.
      * An action plan to deepen the market for long term bonds with specific focus on infrastructure sector, to be put in place.

    “We shall further simplify procedures, incentivize performance, reduce red-tape and make the best use of technology. Big structural reforms in particular, in indirect taxation, bankruptcy and real estate carried out”, the Finance Minister stated. The number of patents issued more than trebled in 2017-18 as against the number in 2014.
