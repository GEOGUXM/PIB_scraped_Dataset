      Posted On: 24 JUL 2019 4:52PM by PIB Delhi


    Defence Ministry has prepared digital data of the entire land/properties/estate under its jurisdiction.


    The computerization of defence land records under project ‘Raksha Bhoomi’ to digitize land records was undertaken by the Directorate General of Defence Estates in association with National Informatics Centre. Defence Land Records contained in General Land Registers (GLRs) and Military Land Registers (MLRs) were entered in the Raksha Bhoomi Software and made operational after verification and authentication of database in July, 2011.


    The process of integrating the data on encroachment of defence land in the Raksha Bhoomi data base is an ongoing process. The State / UT-wise details of total defence land reported to be under encroachment as on 31.12.2018 are given below.

    Detection, prevention and removal of encroachment is a continuous exercise. Action for removal of encroachments on defence land are taken under the provisions of Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971 as well as under the Cantonment Act, 2006. Cases are also taken up with State or Municipal authorities for resolution of the problem. Additionally, the Government has undertaken the following steps to check encroachment:

      * Strengthening of defence land management by way of digitisation of land records, survey, demarcation and verification of defence lands and land Audit.
      * Issue of detailed instructions by the Government emphasizing the need for ensuring vigilance, detection and prevention of new encroachments.
      * The process of defence land audit has been institutionalised from 2011-12 as a continuing process.
      * Court cases are being pursued to evict encroachers.
      * Close liaison is maintained with revenue and civil police authorities to detect attempt to encroach upon the defence land by encroachers.
      * Fencing of defence lands located in isolated locations and regular patrolling is being carried out to safeguard the lands from encroachers and unauthorized construction.
