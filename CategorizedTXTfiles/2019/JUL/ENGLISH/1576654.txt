    In Assam State, BADP covers 28 border blocks of 8 districts (viz, Dhubri, Cachar, Karimganj, Kokrajhar, Baska, Chirang, Udalguri, South Salmara-Mankachar). The State Government has utilized funds under BADP mainly on construction of School buildings, Public Health Centers (PHCs), Community Centers, roads, paths, culverts and bridges, social infrastructure, drinking water facilities etc.


    Funds under BADP are not released to the Border Guarding Forces (BGFs). However, Border Guarding Forces (BGFs) are an integral part of the Committee at the District as well as State level which identify, appraise and recommend schemes/projects of strategic and developmental nature for the border. BGFs are also member of the Empowered Committee in the Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India which approves the Annual Action Plan of the BADP.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Nityanand Rai in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.
