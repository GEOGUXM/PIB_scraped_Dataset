      Posted On: 16 JUL 2019 4:40PM by PIB Delhi


    MoHFW had drafted a "Digital Information Security in Healthcare Act (DISHA Act)” with the objective to ensure data privacy, confidentiality, reliability and security of digital health data. This Ministry forwarded the draft legislation to Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) for seeking their inputs and guidance.


    In response, it was informed that MeitY is in process of enacting ‘Data Protection Framework on Digital Information Privacy, Security & Confidentiality’ Act, which would be applicable in all domains including health. This act would provide the framework for Ministry to utilize the patient data in programmes in a secured manner.


    Therefore, the Ministry submitted the draft DISHA Act to MeitY to be subsumed in the upcoming ‘Data Protection Framework on Digital Information Privacy, Security & Confidentiality’ Act to avoid the duplicity of effort.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
