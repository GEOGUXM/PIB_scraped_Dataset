      Posted On: 15 JUL 2019 2:44PM by PIB Delhi


    The challenges faced by soldiers posted in Siachen Glacier stem from the peculiar terrain and weather conditions.The major challenges due to inclement weather conditions are reduced human body efficiency, bright sunlight leading to snow blindness, blizzards and white out conditions.The troops deployed at forward posts bear the risk of avalanches, crevasses on glaciated surfaces and have to negotiate Ice walls apart from facing the common ailments associated with high altitude and glaciated terrain.


    The visit of dignitaries is always a big morale booster.The troops deployed in high altitude have always been given high priority and significant improvements have been made in equipment, clothing, rations, and Housing facilities.


    This information was given by Raksha Rajya Mantri Shri Shripad Naik in a written reply to ShriC.M. Rameshin Rajya Sabha today.
