      Posted On: 11 JUL 2019 4:22PM by PIB Delhi


    This Ministry has been regularly receiving proposals from the North Eastern states, and during the last three years, projects to the tune of Rs.3400 crore have been sanctioned under different schemes and packages of this Ministry like Non-Lapsable Central Pool of Resources (NLCPR), North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme (NESIDS), Karbi Anglong Autonomous Territorial Council (KAATC), Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC), Dima Hasao Autonomous Territorial Council (DHATC) and Social & Infrastructure Development Fund (SIDF).


    Obtaining regulatory clearances is the responsibility of the State Government. The State Government of Mizoram has informed about one project of Solid Waste Management at Lunglei, sanctioned by this Ministry, being held up due to Environment Clearance. No other State from the North Eastern Region has informed about any project sanctioned by this Ministry being delayed on account of regulatory reasons.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
