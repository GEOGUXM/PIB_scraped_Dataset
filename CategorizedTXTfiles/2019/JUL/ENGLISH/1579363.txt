      Posted On: 18 JUL 2019 4:41PM by PIB Delhi


    As per National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, a total number of 57, 119 and 142 cases were registered during 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively under the category insult to the modesty of women at office premises. The State/UT-wise details are at Annexure-I . The latest data available with NCRB pertains to the year 2016.


    The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 mandates all workplaces, including, any department, organisation, undertaking, establishment, institutions, office, branch or unit which is established, owned, controlled or wholly or substantially financed by funds provided directly or indirectly by the appropriate Government or the local authority or a Government company or a corporation or a co-operative society having more than 10 workers to constitute Internal Committees (ICs) for receiving complaints of sexual harassment of women at workplaces. Educational Institutions are also covered under the Act.


    The Act casts an obligation upon all the employers to constitute Internal Committees and for inquiry to be completed in a sensitive and time bound manner by Internal Committees. There is no centralized mechanism to collect data related to Internal Committees and of the cases of sexual harassment looked into by such committees.
