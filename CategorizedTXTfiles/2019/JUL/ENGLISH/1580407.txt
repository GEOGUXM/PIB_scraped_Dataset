    There is no such classification of high risk states under Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP).


    As per the program guideline, review meetings are done on a periodic basis at National, State and District level.


    During the review meetings, the performance of the States is analyzed under various thematic areas including Drug Sensitive Tuberculosis (DSTB) services, Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (DRTB) services (diagnostic and treatment), TB Co-morbidities, Infrastructure, Human Resource, Finance, Drugs & Supply chain management, Medical colleges’ contribution, Supervision & monitoring.


    Government of India has conducted regional review from November 2018 to May 2019 covering all the States/UTs


    As a result, total TB cases reported under RNTCP has increased by 12% to 12.02 Lakhs during Jan to June 2019, as compared to 10.70 Lakhs during Jan to June 2018.


    The Ministry has developed the National Strategic Plan (NSP) for Tuberculosis (2017-2025) with the goal of ending TB by 2025.


    The key focus areas are:

      * Early diagnosis of all the TB patients, prompt treatment with quality assured drugs and treatment regimens along with suitable patient support systems to promote adherence.
      * Engaging with the patients seeking care in the private sector.
      * Prevention strategies including active case finding and contact tracing in high risk / vulnerable population
      * Airborne infection control.
      * Multi-sectoral response for addressing social determinants.
