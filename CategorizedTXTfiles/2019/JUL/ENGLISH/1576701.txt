    A proposal for granting Classical status to Marathi Language was received from Marathi Language Department, Government of Maharashtra. The said proposal was placed before the Committee of Linguistic Experts for its consideration. However, in the light of several Writ Petitions filed by Shri R. Gandhi in the Hon’ble High Court of Judicature at Madras on the subject, it was decided to wait for the outcome of the said Writ Petitions. The Hon’ble High Court of judicature at Madras has disposed off the Writ Petitions vide common order dated 08.08.2016 declining to interfere in the matter and disposed off all the Writ Petitions. The proposal is again under active consideration in consultation with other Ministries and Committee of Linguistic Experts through Sahitya Akademi.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (I/c) of Culture and Tourism, Shri Prahalad Singh Patel in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
