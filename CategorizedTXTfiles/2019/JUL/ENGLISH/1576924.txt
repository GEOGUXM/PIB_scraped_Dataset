    India enjoys trade surplus in SAARC region. Any decision to review or otherwise the terms of SAFTA and ISFTA is dependent upon the bilateral views of the parties to these agreements. No decision has been taken on the issue of review of SAFTA and ISFTA as yet.


    India is not importing pepper from Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal . The various steps taken up by the Government to curb import of pepper from Sri Lanka and Vietnam include, inter-alia, the following:

     1. The Union Government Vide Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) Notification dated 6/12/2017 fixed Rs.500/- per kg as the Minimum Import Price for black pepper.

     1. Subsequently, an amendment was brought in the Minimum Import Price (MIP) notification by making import of pepper at or above Rs.500/- per kilogram free and import below Rs.500/ per kg prohibited vide DGFT Notification dated 21/3/2018.


     1. To prevent improper import of pepper from other countries taking advantage of preferential access under the India-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISLFTA) and Agreement on South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA), Sri Lankan Authorities were requested to exercise extreme care and diligence in issuing the Certificate of Origin.


     1. On our request, Sri- Lanka has introduced a new procedure to prevent misuse of Certificates of Origin for third-country black pepper shipments destined to India. While issuing such Certificates of Origins, relevant authorities in Sri Lanka are also cross verifying information on exports of pepper obtained from different sources in Sri Lanka, to ascertain the genuineness of exports. Sri Lanka has also put in place a mechanism under which access has been given to Indian authorities to examine the scanned copies of Certificates of Origin issued for black pepper exports under ISFLTA and SAFTA.


     1. Sri Lanka has temporarily suspended import of spices including pepper and areca nuts through the Entreport Trade and Commercial Hub Operations to prevent these spices being re-shipped from Sri Lanka to India as Sri Lankan products.


     1. Sri Lanka has also agreed to facilitate the visit of a technical team to examine the existing procedures in Sri Lanka for issuing Certificate of Origin and the new mechanism set up by Sri Lanka for verification of authenticity of certificates issued for black pepper shipments exported by Sri Lanka under ISFTA and SAFTA.


     1. Instruction has been issued to authorized officers of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) and field formations of Customs to be vigilant at the point of entry in the ports in order to address the possibility of entry of inferior quality pepper from various countries.


    This information was given by the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
