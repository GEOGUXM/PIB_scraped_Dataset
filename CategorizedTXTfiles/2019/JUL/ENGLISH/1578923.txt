      Posted On: 16 JUL 2019 4:35PM by PIB Delhi


    The Family Planning programme is one of the major components of support under the National Health Mission (NHM). States have the flexibility to propose for family planning activities as per their felt need. The Government has come up with various new initiatives like the Mission Parivar Vikas, new spacing methods, Family Planning Logistics Management Information System etc. focusing on quality in family planning. Accordingly, budgetary provisions have been made and there has been an increase in family planning budget every year.


    Programme Implementation Plan (PIP) of financial year 2019-20, submitted by all States/UTs were appraised and approvals were granted before the beginning of the financial year.


    For timely release of funds, regular follow up is done with States to ensure timely compliance of Department of Expenditure (DOE) conditionalities and for timely transfer of funds from State Treasuries to State Health Societies.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
