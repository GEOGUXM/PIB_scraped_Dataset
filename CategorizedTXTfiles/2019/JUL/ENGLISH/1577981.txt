    A web based Public Service Delivery System (PSDS) had been launched by the Ministry of Tourism to enable all the applicants seeking approval for hotel projects, classification/re-classification and related services to track the progress of their applications online on a real time basis.


    With a view to bring in more transparency and accountability, the classification/reclassification of hotels and project level approval by Ministry of Tourism, has been digitized with the introduction of http://hotelcloud.nic.in software in 2015. The payment of fees in respect of such applications are also received online.


    The objective of the system is to ease the process of filing applications by hotels, thereby making the process paperless. The Ministry of Tourism endeavours to communicate the final decision on all such applications within 90 days of the receipt of application complete in all respects.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (I/C) of Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Tourism, Shri Prahlad Singh Patel in reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
