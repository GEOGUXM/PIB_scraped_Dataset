      Fruit Exports
      Posted On: 24 JUL 2019 6:18PM by PIB Delhi


    India’s share in world exports of fruits like apple, pear, peach, plum, apricot and cherry is very low. These fruits are grown in temperate climates and in India can be grown only in specific regions. As such, the availability of exportable surplus of these fruits as well as availability of right quality, colour, size, texture and aroma of fruits, suitable for exports, is low. Details of India’s share in world fruit exports are as under:

    For overall promotion of agricultural exports, the Government has introduced a comprehensive Agriculture Export Policy. The Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), an autonomous organisation under the administrative control of the Department of Commerce, has the mandate to promote exports of fruits. APEDA provides assistance to the exporters of fruits under various component of its scheme “Agriculture & Processed Food Export Promotion Scheme of APEDA” viz. Infrastructure Development, Quality Development and Market Development. In addition, incentives are available on export of various fruits under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS). Assistance is also provided to exporters/state governments under various other schemes of Department of Commerce - Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES), Transport & Marketing Assistance (TMA) Scheme and Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme.
