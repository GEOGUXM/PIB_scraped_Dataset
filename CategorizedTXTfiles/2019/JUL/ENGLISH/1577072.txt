    The Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman tabled the Economic Survey 2018-19 in the Parliament today. The Key Highlights of Economic Survey 2018-19 are as follows:


    Shifting gears: Private Investment as the Key Driver of Growth, Jobs, Exports and Demand

      * Survey states that pathways for trickle-down opened up during the last five years; and benefits of growth and macroeconomic stability reached the bottom of the pyramid.
      * Sustained real GDP growth rate of 8% needed for a $5 trillion economy by 2024-25.
      * “ Virtuous Cycle ” of savings, investment and exports catalyzed and supported by a favorable demographic phase required for sustainable growth.
      * Private investment - key driver for demand, capacity, labor productivity, new technology, creative destruction and job creation.
      * Survey departs from traditional Anglo-Saxon thinking by viewing the economy as being either in a virtuous or a vicious cycle, and thus never in equilibrium.
      * Key ingredients for a self-sustaining virtuous cycle:
          + Presenting data as a public good .
          + Emphasizing legal reforms .
          + Ensuring policy consistency .
          + Encouraging behavior change using principles of behavioral economics .
          + Nourishing MSMEs to create more jobs and become more productive.
          + Reducing the cost of capital.
          + Rationalizing the risk-return trade-off for investments.

          + Changing the default option.
          + Repeated reinforcements.

          + From ‘Swachh Bharat’ to ‘ Sundar Bharat’.

      * Survey focuses on enabling MSMEs to grow for achieving greater profits, job creation and enhanced productivity.
      * Dwarfs (firms with less than 100 workers) despite being more than 10 years old, account for more than 50% of all organized firms in manufacturing by number.
      * Contribution of dwarfs to employment is only 14% and to productivity is a mere 8%.
      * Large firms (more than 100 employees) account for 75% employment and close to 90% of productivity despite accounting for about 15% by number.
      * Unshackling MSMEs and enabling them to grow by way of:
          + Asunset clause of less than 10 years, with necessary grand-fathering, for all size-based incentives.

      * Uncertainty dampens investment growth in India for about five quarters.

      * Adopting appropriate technologies through Custom Hiring Centers and implementation of ICT are critical to improve resource-use efficiency among small and marginal farmers.
      * Diversification of livelihoods is critical for inclusive and sustainable development in agriculture and allied sectors. Policies should focus on
