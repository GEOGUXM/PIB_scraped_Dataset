    As per information provided by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), a total of 38,455, 33,433 and 35,849 cases were reported against juveniles in the country during 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively. State/UT-wise n umber of cases reported against Juveniles and Juveniles apprehended during 2014-2016 is Annexed .


    The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act) is the primary legislation for ensuring the safety, security, dignity and well-being of children. The Act provides for protection of children in need of care and protection and those in conflict with law by catering to their basic needs through proper care, protection, development, treatment and social re-integration. It defines standards of care and protection to secure the best interest of child.


    The primary responsibility of execution of the JJ Act, 2015 lies with the State Governments. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules, 2016 framed under JJ Act, inter-alia specify standards for physical infrastructure, clothing, bedding, nutrition & diet, as well as rehabilitation measures such as education, vocational training and counselling.


    The Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing “Child Protection Services” (CPS) (erstwhile Integrated Child Protection Scheme) for providing financial assistance to State Governments/UT Administrations with the objective to create a safe and secure environment for overall development of children in need of care and protection and children in conflict with law. Under CPS financial assistance is provided to the State Governments/UT Administrations for setting up and maintenance of various types of Child Care Institutions.
