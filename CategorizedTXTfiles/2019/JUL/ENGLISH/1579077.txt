      Posted On: 17 JUL 2019 2:05PM by PIB Delhi


    Indian Coast Guard (ICG) in a coordinated operation with BangladeshCoast Guard successfully repatriated 516 fishermen alongwith 32 Indian Fishing boats from Bangladesh on July 16, 2019. These boats were stranded and had taken shelter at Payra Port in Banladesh approximately 135 kilometres from IMBL(International Maritime Boundary Line) due to inclement weather and rough sea conditions in the Bay of Bengal.


    The fishing boats were escorted by two Bangladesh Coast Guard Ships Mansoor Ali and Sadhini Bangla up to the IMBL where they were formally handed over to ICGships Vijaya and Anmol. The boats alongwith the fishermen are being escorted up to Kakdwip harbour where they will be handed over to the State Fisheries Authorities.


    This Samaritan gesture from the Bangladesh Coast Guard comes at a time when the visit of delegation of the Bangladesh Coast Guard to India is underway for Annual Zonal /Regional Commanderâ€™s meeting at Kolkata.


    Search for remaining 24 missing Indian fishermen is in progress by Bangladesh Coast Guard/Naval ships/aircraft in Bangladesh Waters. Besides search across IMBL in Bangladesh waters, Indian Coast Guard Ships, hovercraft and aircraft are also carrying out search off West Bengal Coast and along the IMBL.


    The coordinated response between Coast Guard agencies of India and Bangladesh demonstrates mutual commitment for safety of fishermen at sea and further strengthens the bilateral relationship between the two countries.
