    As on date, no proposal to grant special packages to the Assam Cooperative Jute Mills Ltd., Silghat, Nagaon (Assam) is under consideration. However, preferential treatment is given in allocation of Production cum Supply Orders (PCSOs) as per its capacity under the Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packing Commodities) [JPM Act], 1987 because of its disadvantageous geographical location and limited options for local markets.


    This information was given by the Union Minister of Textiles, Smriti Zubin Irani, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
