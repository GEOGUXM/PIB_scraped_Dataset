      Posted On: 09 JUL 2019 6:11PM by PIB Delhi


    Out of 1.03 crore houses sanctioned till 8.7.2019 under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana - Gramin (PMAY-G), 62.92 lakh landless beneficiaries, who derive major part of their income from manual casual labour, have been sanctioned houses. State Govt./UT Administrations, responsible to provide land to the landless, are yet to provide land to 3.26 lakh landless PMAY-G beneficiaries. The State/UT-wise details, including Maharashtra, are given at Annexure-I.


    Under PMAY-G, landless beneficiaries are accorded the highest priority and are on top in the Permanent Wait List. Concerned State Govts./UT Administrations are responsible to provide land to the landless PMAY-G beneficiary from the government land or any other land including public land (Panchayat common land, community land or land belonging to other local authorities). The matter of providing land to the landless PMAY-G beneficiaries is reviewed regularly by the Ministry with the States/UTs, including at the highest level in the States/UTs.


    The details of beneficiaries identified for assistance and the beneficiaries provided assistance under rural housing scheme during the last 5 years are available in E4 report and A2 report, respectively at website https://pmayg.nic.in. The data is drillable upto beneficiary level for the States/UTs. The number of houses sanctioned under rural housing scheme in the last 5 years in 13 districts of Bundelkhand region is given at Annexure II.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister for Rural Development, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar in the Lok Sabha today.
