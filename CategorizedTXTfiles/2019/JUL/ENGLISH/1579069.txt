    Major expenditure was incurred by different Ministries in infrastructure sectors such as roads, power, etc. and in social sectors such as education, health, women & child development, rural development, etc. in North Eastern Region in these years. Ministry of DoNER has taken up projects under the schemes of Non-Lapsable Central Pool of Resources, North Eastern Council (NEC), North East Road Sector Development Scheme, North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme (NESIDS), Special Packages for funding identified infrastructure and development projects of the Bodoland Territorial Council, Karbi Anglong Territorial Council and Dima Hasao Territorial Council and the externally aided North East Rural Livelihood Project (NERLP) for filing gaps in physical infrastructure in the North Eastern Region, particularly in roads, power & water and in social sectors like livelihood, health, education etc.


    Third party evaluation of all the ongoing schemes was carried out in 2017-18 for outcome based review before their continuation beyond the 12 th five year plan. These schemes will lead to better connectivity within the country as well as with neighbouring countries, improved tourist arrivals, sustainable livelihoods, improved power availability, improved access to education and health services, etc. in the North Eastern States.
