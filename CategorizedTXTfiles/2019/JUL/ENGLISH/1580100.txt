    Defence Expenditure is increasing every year in absolute terms implying higher spending. From 2016-17 to 2019-20, expenditure on Defence has increased by Rs. 90,089 crore.


    Measuring defence expenditure as a percentage of GDP creates an illusion of declined spending by ignoring the size of the Economy. If the economy grows at a faster rate, spending decreases as a percentage of GDP, but it doesnâ€™t mean that the level of spending has fallen or has become inadequate.


    For the year 2019-20, the total Defence Budget (including Civil and Pensions) is Rs. 4,31,010.79 crore, which is 15.47% of total Central Government Expenditure (Rs. 27,86,349 crore). Also, Capital Budget of Ministry of Defence for 2018-19 is approximately 31.97% of the total capital expenditure of the Central Government.


    There is an increasing trend in Actual Expenditure. Government has taken steps to delegate substantial financial power to the Service Headquarters for both normal and emergent procurements. This has resulted in faster decision making and ensured full and optimal utilization of allocated budget.
