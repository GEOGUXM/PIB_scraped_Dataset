      Selection of Lawyers, Law Firms and Subject Experts to Represent India in WTO Disputes and ISDS Cases
      Posted On: 12 JUL 2019 4:06PM by PIB Delhi


    The Department of Commerce defends India’s interests on trade issues in WTO. Department of Economic Affairs coordinates ISDS cases and these are individually taken up by relevant line Ministries/ Departments.


    Department of Commerce empanels law firms through a process of selection committee based on subject expertise in international trade and WTO law.


    A rotational policy is adopted while engaging law firms to ensure that law firms get opportunities to improve their expertise. Think tanks such as Centre for Trade and Investment Law and Centre for WTO Studies are also consulted regularly on India’s disputes to improve expertise on such issues.


    At present, India is involved in fourteen WTO disputes (Annex-I), all of which are being handled by domestic law firms. In one of these disputes, the expertise of the Geneva based international law organization ‘Advisory Centre on WTO Law (ACWL)’, which assists developing countries on WTO law was engaged to guide the domestic law firm in a WTO dispute. There is no ISDS case pending with Department of Commerce.
