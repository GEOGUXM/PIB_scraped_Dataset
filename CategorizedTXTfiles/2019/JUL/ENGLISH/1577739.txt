    Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas is working in collaboration with various Central Government Ministries to achieve the goal to reduce the dependency on import from oil and gas. The five-pronged strategy, in this context, broadly comprises of increasing domestic production of oil and gas, promoting energy efficiency and conservation measures, giving thrust on demand substitution, capitalizing untapped potential in biofuels and other alternate fuels/ renewables and implementing measures for refinery process improvements.


    Government has taken several steps to enhance exploration & production of oil and gas in the country which include, Discovered Small Field Policy, Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy, Policy for Extension of Production Sharing Contracts, Policy for early monetization of Coal Bed Methane, Appraisal of Unappraised areas in Sedimentary Basins, Policy to Promote and Incentivize Enhanced Recovery Methods for Oil and Gas etc.


    The Government in February, 2019 approved major reforms in exploration and licensing policy to enhance exploration activities, attract domestic and foreign investment in unexplored/unallocated areas of sedimentary basins and accelerate domestic production of oil and gas from existing fields. The policy reforms inter-alia aim to boost exploration activities with greater weightage to work programme, simplified fiscal and contractual terms, bidding of exploration blocks under Category II and III sedimentary basins without any production or revenue sharing to Government, early monetization of discoveries by extending fiscal incentives, incentivizing gas production including marketing and pricing freedom etc.


    Government is also promoting the usage of environment friendly transportation fuel, i.e. CNG by expanding the coverage of City Gas Distribution (CGD) network in the country. Government has also taken a number of initiatives to encourage the use of alternative fuels like ethanol and bio-diesel through Ethanol Blending in Petrol (EBP) Programme and Bio-diesel blending in diesel. To promote use of compressed bio gas, Government has launched Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) on 01.10.2018. Government has also formulated a National Bio Fuel Policy 2018 to boost availability of biofuels in country.
