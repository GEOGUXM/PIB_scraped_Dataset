    Appropriate retaliation to the ceasefire violations, as required has been carried out by Indian Army. Also all violations of ceasefire and infiltration are taken up with Pakistan authorities at the appropriate level through the established mechanism of hotlines, flag meeting, Directorate Generals of Military Operations talks as well as diplomatic channels between the two countries.
