      Ministry of Tribal Affairs

      National Tribal Policy
      Posted On: 15 JUL 2019 5:04PM by PIB Delhi


    Ministry of Tribal Affairs had prepared a draft National Tribal Policy in 2006. This became out of context in view of certain legislative and policy changes and these necessitated further revision of the draft policy. Meanwhile, a High Level Committee (HLC) was constituted on 14.08.2013 to prepare a position paper on socio-economic status of STs and suggest a way forward. The Committee submitted its Report on 29.05.2014 which contains 108 recommendations cutting across various Central Ministries/Departments as well as State Governments. The recommendations were forwarded to Central Ministries/Departments of Govt. of India and State Governments to furnish their views/comments which are still awaited. Thus the recommendations of the HLC are under consideration of the Government and no time frame has been fixed.


    This information was given by Union Minister of State for Tribal Affairs Smt. Renuka Singh Saruta in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
