    Further, the demand of milk production across the country has not been assessed.


    As per 19 th Livestock Census-2012, the total cattle population in the country is 190.90 million numbers which covers all rural and urban areas including rain fed areas of the country.


    To overcome the shortage of feed and fodder in the country, the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying is implementing Centrally Sponsored Scheme National Livestock Mission with a Sub Mission on Feed and Fodder Development since 2014-15. Under the Sub-Mission, financial assistance is provided to the Animal Husbandry Departments of the States/UTs including Milk Co-operatives for feed and fodder development under the following components:

      * Fodder Production from Non-forest wasteland/ rangeland / grassland/ non-arable land
      * Fodder production from Forest land
      * Fodder Seed Procurement/ Production & Distribution
      * Introduction of Hand Driven Chaff-Cutter
      * Introduction of Power Driven Chaff-Cutter
      * Distribution of low capacity, tractor mountable Fodder Block Making units, hay baling machines/reapers/forage harvesters
      * Establishment of silage making Units
      * Establishment of by-pass protein production units
      * Establishment of Area Specific Mineral Mixture / Feed Pelleting/ Feed Manufacturing Unit.
      * Establishment/modernization of Feed Testing Laboratories

    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Shri Sanjeev Balyan in Lok Sabha today.
