      Posted On: 26 JUL 2019 5:33PM by PIB Delhi


    National Crèche Scheme is being implemented as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme through States/UTs with effect from 01.01.2017 to provide day care facilities to children (age group of 6 months to 6 years) of working mothers in the community. The State Government of Telangana has not taken over any creches which were run under the erstwhile Rajiv Gandhi National Crèche Scheme (RGNCS), a Central Sector Scheme, being implemented through Central Social Welfare Board (CSWB) and Indian Council for Child Welfare (ICCW). Creche facilities are also provided under the Beedi& Cigar Worker (Conditions of Employment) Act,1966.


    The details of Budget provision and expenditure incurred for the last five years and current year are at Annexure-I . The fund sharing pattern under National Creche Scheme amongst Centre, States/UTs & Non Governmental Organisations/Voluntary Organisations for all recurring components of the scheme is in the ratio of 60:30:10 for States, 80:10:10 for North Eastern States and Himalayan States and 90:0:10 for UTs. The details of funds released for the last three years 2016-17 (w.e.f. 01.01.2017), 2017-18 and 2018-19 are in Annexure-II .


    Grants have been released to the State Governments/UT Administration for Creches found functional and taken over by them.
