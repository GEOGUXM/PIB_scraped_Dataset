    Finance Minister’s budget speech in Lok Sabha on 29.02.2016 for 2016-17 budget included the following reference to nuclear energy:


    “In the power sector, we need to diversify the sources of power generation for long term stability. Government is drawing up a comprehensive plan, spanning next 15 to 20 years, to augment the investment in nuclear power generation. Budgetary allocation up to ₹ 3,000 crore per annum, together with public sector investments, will be leveraged to facilitate the required investment for this purpose.”


    The Government has already accorded administrative approval and financial sanction for setting up four units of 700 MW each at Gorakhpur in Haryana and the first two units - GHAVP 1&2 (2X700 MW) are under construction.


    The process of identification of suitable sites for locating future nuclear power plants is an ongoing activity, carried out by the Standing Site Selection Committee (SSSC) of the Department of Atomic Energy.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
