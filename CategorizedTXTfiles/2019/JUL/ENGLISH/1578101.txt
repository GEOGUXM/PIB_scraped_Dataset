      Posted On: 10 JUL 2019 3:38PM by PIB Delhi


    Keeping in view the exigencies of work, Ministries/Departments may hire professionals or consultants for a specific job, not against a regular post. Some retired senior civil servants having expertise and eminence are also appointed as Advisors with a view to achieve certain specified public policy objectives.


    As the respective Ministries/Departments are authorised to engage consultants, no centralised data is maintained.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, DrJitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
