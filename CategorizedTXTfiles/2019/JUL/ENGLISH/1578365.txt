      Registration of Child Care Institutions
      Posted On: 11 JUL 2019 3:38PM by PIB Delhi


    All adoptions under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act (JJ Act), 2015 are done through a Centralised System - Child Adoption Resource Information and Guidance System (CARINGS) which is maintained by Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA). As per CARINGS, 3664 children are legally free for adoption in Specialised Adoption Agencies (SAAs) and Child Care Institutions (CCIs) against 25,265 Prospective Adoptive Parents who registered for adoption.


    As per provisions of the JJ Act, 2015, CCIs are not required to be registered with CARA. However, under Section 41 of the JJ Act, 2015, all CCIs housing children in need of care and protection and children in conflict with law are to be mandatorily registered with State Governments/UT Administrations. As reported by States and UTs on 8.01.2019, there are 7909 CCIs registered in the country under the JJ Act, 2015.


    In order to ensure that all registered CCIs housing orphaned/ abandoned/ surrendered children are linked to a SAA, the Ministry of Women and Child Development issues advisories from time to time to all State Governments/ UT Administrations.


    This information was given by the Minister of Women and Child Development, Smriti Zubin Irani, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
