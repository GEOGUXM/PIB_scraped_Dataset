    The Ministry is also implementing the programmes of Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS) and Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution. Under both the programmes, assistance is provided as 100% grant in the form of an additive to State Governments for various activities including health sector. The interventions related to health sector funded under the programmes are strengthening of building infrastructure of CHC / PHC, Mobile dispensary in remote locations, conduct of screening for acute health problems like Sickle Cell Anaemia among tribal students and provision of health cards, focus on eradication of prevalent endemic health problems like Malaria, Leprosy, TB etc. These interventions are demand driven and funds are provided to State Governments based upon proposals received from the State Governments and after appraisal and approval by a Project Appraisal Committee (PAC) in the Ministry. In recent years, no healthcare project was sanctioned under SCA to TSS or Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution.
