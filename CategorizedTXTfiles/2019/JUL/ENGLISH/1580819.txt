    The Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) has bagged fresh order from Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Allahabad for supply of 543 khadi jackets and 450 Angavastrams worth Rs. 7 lakhs.


    KVIC Chairman Shri Vinai Kumar Saxena informed that these are to be used during the upcoming convocation ceremony of IIIT and this order can be a trendsetter for other educational institutions as Khadi carries a unique Indianness. This order contains Blue Denim Khadi Jacket, Green Printed Khadi Jacket and Lemon Yellow Printed Khadi Jacket. He expressed hope that in the long-run, the jackets and the Angavastram made by our artisans will be a unique model for the convocation attire for all the noted academic institutions. It may be noted that KVIC has already bagged order of different varieties of Khadi Silk robes with Angawastram from Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) in March this year.
