    As per the available data, during the years 2016, 2017, 2018 and uptil 01.04.2019, total 27 accused persons were extradited / deported from foreign countries to India, based on Red Notice / Extradition requests made by Indian law enforcement agencies.


    During the years 2016, 2017 and 2018, Red Notice requests sent to Interpol by Central Bureau of Investigation (National Central Bureau of Interpol, India) were 91, 94 and 123 and Notices published by Interpol were 87, 84 and 76 respectively.


    Red Notice is issued by Interpol and is meant to facilitate quick location and arrest of a person abroad and providing the information to the national agency / authority on whose request the Notice was issued. The Red Notice is not a pre-requisite for and may not necessarily lead to the extradition of a fugitive offender for which there is a separate legal process to be followed.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G. Kishan Reddy in a written reply to question in the Rajya Sabha today.
