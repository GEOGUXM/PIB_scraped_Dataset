    (i) approve a plan providing for contribution for meeting the liquidation costs,


    (ii) recommend sale of the corporate debtor or sale of business of the corporate debtor as a going concern, and

    The salient amendments affected by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Liquidation Process) (Amendment) Regulations, 2019 are:


    (i) The amendments specify the process for (i) sale of corporate debtor as going concern, and (ii) sale of business of corporate debtor as going concern under liquidation. These also provide that where a corporate debtor is sold as a going concern, the liquidation process shall be closed without dissolution of the corporate debtor.
