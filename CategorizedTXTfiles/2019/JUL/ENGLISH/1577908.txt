      Posted On: 09 JUL 2019 2:43PM by PIB Delhi


    Under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, a three tier quasi-judicial mechanism has been set up at District, State and Central levels for better protection of the interests of consumers and to provide simple and speedy redressal of consumer disputes including online frauds. The consumer fora are empowered to give relief of a specific nature and award, wherever appropriate, compensation to consumers. Besides, the Department of Consumer Affairs is also running a National Consumer Helpline (NCH) where a consumer can call to seek information, advice or guidance and file complaints.


    The number of complaints regarding online shopping after operationalization of online complaint filing from August, 2016 to March, 2019 in the National Consumer Helpline is 8373.


    The complaints received in the NCH are forwarded to the companies concerned for redressal. During the period December, 2016 and March, 2019, in 913 such cases the complainants have been advised by the NCH to approach the local police.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri Danve Raosaheb Dadarao in the Lok Sabha today.
