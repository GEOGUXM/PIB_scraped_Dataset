    National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) under the aegis of MSDE has been leading India’s delegation at this biennial event since 2011.

India also finished 19 th out of 56 countries which participated at this event, making it India’s best performance since its participation at this event.


    Journey to WorldSkills 2019


    The selection of Team India for WorldSkills 2019 began in January 2018, with the roll out of a scheme on IndiaSkills Competitions. More than 22 states collaborated and organized close to 500 district and state level competitions between March and April 2018. The winners at these events, competed at four regional competitions organized at Jaipur, Lucknow, Bangalore and Bhubaneswar.


    The winners from the regional competitions further competed at the National Competition organized from 2 nd to 6 th October 2018 at Aerocity Grounds in Delhi. Since then, the selected candidates have been undergoing rigorous training and have also participated in international competitions in order to hone their skills and gain the required experience. Most competitors have also received training at international centers which has significantly enhanced their skills.


    The Team India includes participants from all over the country, including 6 from the North-Eastern region. 77% of these come from tier 2 and tier 3 cities and can speak 10 different languages. Most of these competitors come from a very humble background, with 35% have their parents either employed in the agriculture sector or are working as daily wage earners.


    Announcing the Team India , Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey, Minister for Skill Development & Entrepreneurship said, “Through WorldSkills Competition, we aim to provide opportunities to the youth in our country to compete with, and learn from, their peers across the globe. Such initiatives also help us benchmark our skills to the international standards and will improve the overall quality of vocational training in India. It is a proud feeling to witness the passion, effort and dedication with which these young competitors are preparing for the WorldSkills. I congratulate each one of them for their journey so far and wish them the very best for all their future endeavors. I believe they will inspire future competitors and all those who aspire to excel in their careers through vocational training.”
