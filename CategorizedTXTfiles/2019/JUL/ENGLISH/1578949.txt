    Development of border areas has been a focus area for the Government of India. Border Area Development Programme (BADP) is the major intervention of the Government in this direction with an aim to fill critical gaps in provision of essential social and economic infrastructure in the border areas to ensure equitable development in these areas.


    The works/projects undertaken in the border areas, including along Indo-China border, relate to construction of roads, bridges, safe drinking water supply, health, agriculture and allied activities, social sector activities such as creation of social infrastructure, capacity building and skill development, construction of toilets particularly for women, sports activities, promotion of rural tourism, border tourism etc. During the financial years 2015-16 to 2018-19 construction of 1935 kms roads/ link roads, 2765 mtr bridges/ culverts etc, 520 numbers of sports fields/ stadia, 11 residential schools, 37 numbers tourism related infrastructure, 34 warehouses and 52 livelihood and organic farming programmes were undertaken for improving the economic status of border population.


    These activities help in creating an environment for sustainable living in the border areas of the country by providing additional job opportunities, improving quality of life and standard of living in the border areas, while also helping integrate the border areas with the mainland, building a positive perception and encouraging the people to stay on in the border areas.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Nityanand Rai in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.
