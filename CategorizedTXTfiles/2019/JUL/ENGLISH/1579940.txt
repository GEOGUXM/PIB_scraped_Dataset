    The details of the habitations that remain to be connected under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) as on 18.07.2019 are given at Annexure.


    As per PMGSY guidelines, it is the responsibility of the State Government/ District Panchayat to ensure that lands are available for taking up the proposed road works. PMGSY does not provide funds for Land Acquisition. The State Governments may also lay down guidelines for voluntary donation, exchange or other mechanisms to ensure availability of land.


    PMGSY has a very well-tailored programme guidelines defining the role of Central and State Government agencies. States and Union Governments are working together for successful implementation of the programme. The progress of implementation of rural roads under PMGSY is regularly reviewed with the States by way of Regional Review Meetings (RRMs), Performance Review Committee (PRC) Meetings, Pre-Empowered/Empowered Committee Meetings with the States. In addition to this, special review meetings are also held by Secretary/ Additional Secretary/Joint Secretary, Ministry of Rural Development with Chief Secretaries/Principal Secretaries of the States .


    This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister for Rural Development, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar in the Lok Sabha today.
