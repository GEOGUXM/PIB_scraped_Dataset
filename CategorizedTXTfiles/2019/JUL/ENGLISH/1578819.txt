    Ministry of Human Resource Development had launched “Vittiya Saksharta Abhiyan” in December 2016under which an appeal was made to all the higher educational institutions to develop a cashless campus. Further, Government has taken several initiatives to turn University Campuses cashless by promoting digital transactions. All Universities/affiliated Institutions, Technical Institutions and Centrally Funded Higher Educational Institutions including IITs/IIMs/IIITs etc. were instructed to ensure making all receipts and payments related to the functioning of the Institution viz. student fees, exam fees, vendor payments, salary/wage payments etc. only through on line or digital modes. They were also asked to encourage all the canteens and business establishments on the campus to use only digital modes for their receipts and payments. All the Central Universities under this Ministry, all Indian Institutes of Technologies (IITs), all Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), all National Institutes of Technology ( NITs), and all Indian Institutes of Information Technologies (IITMs) are fully digitalized in their receipts and payments. Point of Sale (POS) machines have been kept/ installed in their canteens and campus stores.


    The information was given by the Union Minister for Human Resource Development, Dr. Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
