    Demand of cement, in general, is linked to growth in infrastructure and housing sectors. Annual installed capacity of cement in the country is around 510 million tones. Annual cement production during the year 2018-19 has been 337.22 million tones resulting in an average capacity utilization of around 67%. In view of the above, there is enough capacity to meet additional demand of cement in future.


    This information was given by the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
