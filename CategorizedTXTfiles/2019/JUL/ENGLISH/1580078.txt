      Posted On: 24 JUL 2019 4:29PM by PIB Delhi


    The national statistical system in India is decentralised both at the central and state levels and the district level statistical system is within the ambit of the State Government. This Ministry provides technical advice to the State Governments for improving the state statistical systems. The State Governments assess the strengths and weaknesses of the statistical systems from time to time and take steps to improve them. India Statistical Strengthening Project, presently known as Support for Statistical Strengthening (SSS) Scheme, is being implemented in States who have signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to improve their statistical systems in respect of matters covered under the Scheme. MoUs have been signed with 20 participating States/Union Territories. An amount of Rs. 307.87 crore has been released to them so far, out of which 82.07% has been reported to be utilised till 15 th July, 2019. The funds are mainly utilised for compilation of local level statistics, creation of integrated State databases, conducting type studies and surveys to address data gaps, compilation of core indicators such as Consumer Price Index and State level Index of Industrial Production, conducting workshops and training programmes for statistical personnel, and strengthening of physical and IT infrastructure.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation and Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Planning, Shri Rao Inderjit Singh in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
