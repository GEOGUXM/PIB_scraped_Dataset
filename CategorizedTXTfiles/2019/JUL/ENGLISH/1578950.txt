      Posted On: 16 JUL 2019 5:36PM by PIB Delhi


    Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an inter-governmental body to examine and develop measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of international financial systems. FATF reviews money laundering and terrorist financing measures taken by countries. As an inter-governmental body, FATF has its own processes of consultation, evaluation and decision making. It may not be appropriate for a member country to make any statement about their processes.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G.Kishan Reddy in a written reply to question in the Lok Sabha today.
