    A number of steps have been taken in the recent years to streamline and strengthen the pension sanctioning and payment system. Department of Pension & Pensioners’ Welfare launched Bhavishya – an online tracking system for pension sanction and payment. By keeping track of the progress as well as close monitoring of each pension case, it introduces transparency and accountability into the system thereby plugging delays. This system is at present being successfully implemented in the main Secretariat of 93 Ministries/Departments including 791 Attached Offices.


    The following measures have been taken by various departments/ agencies to strengthen the redressal system in respect of pension related grievances:

This has led to faster processing of payment of pension and clerical errors have been reduced.
