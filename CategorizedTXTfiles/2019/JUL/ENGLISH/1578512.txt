      Posted On: 12 JUL 2019 3:30PM by PIB Delhi


    To improve the menstrual health among adolescent girls, Government of India is supporting the States/UTs through National Health Mission in their Program Implementation Plans for decentralized procurement of Sanitary napkins packs.


    The scheme encompasses the following:

      * Increasing awareness among adolescent girls on menstrual hygiene
      * Improving access to and use of high quality sanitary napkins by adolescent girls residing in rural areas
      * Scheme is also beingimplemented in the urban areas with roll out in selected cities of 15 States in the first phase.
      * Ensuring safe disposal of sanitary napkins in an environmentally friendly manner.
      * Provision of funds to ASHAs to hold monthly meetings with adolescents to discuss issues related to menstrual hygiene.

    Government of India is providing NHM funds to States/UTs through Program Implementation Plans for decentralized procurement of Sanitary napkins and IEC-BCC activities. Health being a State subject, involvement of NGOs or any private organization to support the activities hence remains the decision of the State/UTs.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), ShAshwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
