    As per Agriculture Census conducted at an interval of every five years by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, the percentage of female operational holdings in the country have increased from 12.78 percent during 2010-11 to 13.78 percent during 2015-16.


    In line with the provisions of National Policy for Farmers (NPF) (2007), the Department of Rural Development, Ministry of Rural Development is already implementing a programme exclusively for women farmers namely, Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana (MKSP), which is a sub-component of Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM). The primary objective of MKSP is to empower women by enhancing their participation in agriculture and to create sustainable livelihood opportunities for them. Funding support to the tune of up to 60% (90% for North Eastern States) for such projects is provided by the Government of India.


    The Department of Agriculture Cooperation and Farmers Welfare is also promoting mainstreaming of Gender Concerns in agriculture by ensuring flow of funds and benefits to the tune of 30% for women farmers under its beneficiary oriented Schemes and Programmes. Besides, Government is providing additional support and assistance to women farmers, over and above the male farmers under a few selected Schemes.


    This information was given by the Union Minister for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Shri Narendra Singh Tomar in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
