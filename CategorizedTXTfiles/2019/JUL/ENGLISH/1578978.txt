      Posted On: 16 JUL 2019 6:07PM by PIB Delhi


    The net sown area in the country is 140130 thousand ha and net irrigated area is 68385 thousand ha. As per available information, the area covered under drip irrigation is 4374.53 thousand ha.


    An Impact evaluation study of Micro Irrigation scheme was carried out by Department of Agriculture Cooperation & Farmers Welfare in 2014 through M/s Global Agri System Ltd. The major findings of the study are as under:

      * Irrigation cost is reduced by 20% to 50% with average of 32.3%.
      * Electricity consumption is reduced by about 31%.
      * Saving of fertilizers in the range of 7% to 42%.
      * Average productivity of fruits and vegetables increased by about 42.3% and 52.8%.
      * Overall income enhancement of farmers in the range of 20% to 68% with an average of 48.5%.

    Water use efficiency of Micro Irrigation including drip irrigation is as high as 80 to 95% in comparison to only 30-50% in conventional flood irrigation resulting in considerable amount of saving irrigation water under drip irrigation as also evident from the research studies conducted on different crops by centres of All India Coordinated Research Project on Irrigation Water Management in different agro-ecological regions of India.


    Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) is implementing Per Drop More Crop component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY-PDMC) which focuses on enhancing water use efficiency at farm level through Micro Irrigation technologies viz. Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation systems.


    Besides, the Department creates awareness about Micro Irrigation by wide publicity through press & print media, publication of leaflets/booklets, organization of workshops, exhibitions, farmer fairs, information on State/Government of India web portals etc. In addition, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) imparts training and organizes field demonstrations through Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVK) to educate farmers for promotion of Micro Irrigation.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shri Narendra Singh Tomar in Lok Sabha today.
