    The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has taken steps to streamline and expedite the settlement of complaints through E-baalnidaan, an Online Complaint Management System, for lodging complaints related to any violation of child rights. Further, for easy and direct reporting of sexual offences against children as well as timely action against the offenders under the POCSO Act, 2012, the POCSO e-Box, an Online Complaint Registration System, has been launched.
