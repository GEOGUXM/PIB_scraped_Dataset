    The Ministry is implementing various schemes/ programs for empowerment of Women and development of Children including through Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) across the country. Under the Centrally Sponsored Schemes, the Central Government provides funds to State Governments/ UT Administrations for implementation of welfare schemes for Women and Children, some of which are implemented through NGO’s such as Swadhar, Ujjawala, Working Women Hostel, Child Protection Services (erstwhile ICPS) and National Crèche Scheme. Scheme-wise allocations and releases for the last three years are available in respective Annual Reports, which are available in the Library of Lok Sabha. The details are also available on the Ministry’s website i.e. https://www.wcd.nic.in .


    The schemes have in-built monitoring mechanism for their effective implementation by NGOs and to check funds utilization. Regular follow-up is done by the Ministry and the States/UTs for every sanction of fund to the NGOs. The schemes are also periodically reviewed for their proper and better implementation. The schemes contain provisions for monitoring of the projects at Panchayat / Block / District Level, State Level and the Central Level. The same mechanisms are being followed in the State of Tamil Nadu also.


    Further, the Ministry is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme ‘Child Protection Services (CPS)’ to provide Institutional and Non-institutional safety net for vulnerable children as envisaged under the JJ Act, 2015. The scheme supports 24x7 outreach helpline service for children in distress. The service is available through a dedicated toll free number, 1098 which can be accessed by children in crisis or by adults on their behalf from any place in the geographical location of India and the outreach service is presently executed through a mother NGO namely, Childline India Foundation (CIF), Mumbai. The ‘CIF’ submits its financial proposal regarding its annual grant which includes, its four Regional centres and all existing partner NGOs, before the Project Approval Board (PAB) at the Ministry which has been constituted to scrutinize and approve implementation plans, Annual Plans and financial proposals from States / UTs and other organizations for release of grants under the CPS scheme. The Ministry also monitors and reviews the progress of implementation of the scheme from time to time. Details of Funds released to Mother NGO during the last three years are as follows:
