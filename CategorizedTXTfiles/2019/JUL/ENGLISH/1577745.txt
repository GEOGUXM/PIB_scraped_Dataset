    Lack of access to latest technologies affects the capability of Small and Medium Enterprises to compete in the global market. In order to support SMEs in accessing latest technologies, the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) implements a scheme named Credit Linked Capital Subsidy and Technology Up-gradation Scheme (CLCS-TUS). One of the components under the schemes is Credit Linked Capital Subsidy (CLCS) under which capital subsidy up to Rs. 15 Lakh is provided to Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) for accessing modern technology.


    Other measures aimed at enhancing competitiveness are as follows:


      * Building awareness of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).

      * Undertaking digital empowerment initiatives.
      * Supporting entrepreneurial and managerial development through Incubators.
      * Providing design expertise to manufacturing enterprises.
      * Adopting lean manufacturing practices.
      * Enabling ZED Certification.

    This information was given by Shri Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
