    *Number of candidates recommended does not exactly correspond to the vacancies reported in that particular year as recruitment process was spilled over to next year in some cases.


    There has been decline in vacancies reported from 2016-17 which led to corresponding decline in number of candidates recommended by the Commission.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Dr. Jitendra Singh in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
