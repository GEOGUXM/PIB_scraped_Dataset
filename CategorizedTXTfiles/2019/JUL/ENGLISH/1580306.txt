    In a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today, Shri Mansukh Mandaviya, the Minister of State for Shipping (I/C) and Chemical & Fertilizers informed that India and Maldives had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Passenger and Cargo Services in Male last month. The objective of the MoU is to improve people to people contact between the two countries by providing an alternate, direct and less expensive means for transport for passengers and goods. It also aims to advance economic, social and cultural ties between the two countries.


    Shri Mandaviya informed that the MoU envisaged a regular passenger and cargo ferry service between Kochi in India and Male/Kulhudhuffushi in Maldives, or any other ports mutually agreed upon. Sea connectivity between the two countries would help to promote inbound tourism, particularly health and wellness tourism.A feasibility study is also being undertaken to ascertain the trade/ cargo potential, infrastructure/ superstructure facilities, vessel deployment and service pattern etc, and further action would be taken based on the findings of the feasibility study, the Minister informed.
