      Exemption to Handloom Sector From GST
      Posted On: 11 JUL 2019 6:21PM by PIB Delhi


    Turnover of most of the weavers does not exceed Rs 20 Lakh and therefore they do not require registration under GST. Moreover, GST is implemented through an Act of Parliament with States as equal partners in GST Council with Government of India.


    GST has been introduced by the Government of India to rationalize multiple taxes on goods & services and to bring transparency in the taxation system. It is applicable to the Textile sectors also, including handlooms.


    This information was given by the Union Minister of Textiles, Smriti Zubin Irani, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
