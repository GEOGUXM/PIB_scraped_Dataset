    Government is promoting tree-based farming for maximizing farm returns and providing sustainable livelihood to farmers, which include ;
    
    i) Sub-Mission on Agroforestry was launched in 2016-17 to encourage tree plantation on farm land “Har Medh Par Ped”, along with crops/ cropping system. There is a provision for financial assistance for nursery development and plantation in farm land which will help the farmer get additional income and make their farming system more climate resilient and adaptive.
    
    ii) National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP), a sub component of National Food Security Mission supports plantation, maintenance and inter cropping with Tree Borne Oilseeds (TBOs) eg. Olive, neem, karanja, Mahua, etc.
    
    iii) Restructured National Bamboo Mission (NBM) was launched in 2018-19 for development of complete value chain, including plantations in non-forest Government land and private farmers field and connecting growers to the market.
