      Posted On: 25 JUL 2019 3:52PM by PIB Delhi


    Van Dhan Vikas Karyakram is an initiative targeting livelihood generation for tribal population by harnessing the wealth of forest i.e. Van Dhan. The programme aims to tap into the traditional knowledge and skill sets of tribal people by adding technology and Information Technology for upgradation of output at each stage and to convert the tribal wisdom into a remunerative economic activity. Van Dhan Vikas Karyakram seeks to promote and leverage the collective strength of tribal people to achieve a viable scale.


    On April 14th, 2018 Hon’ble Prime Minister of India has announced the launching of Van Dhan Yojana in Bijapur, Chhattisgarh under which one Van Dhan Vikas Kendra was set up, as a pilot project, at a cost of Rs.25 lakhs of which 25% is to be met by the State Government. This Van Dhan Vikas Kendra is to cater to ten Self Help Groups of thirty tribal gathers each.


    Implementation of Van Dhan Vikas Karyakram is through Van Dhan Kendras. Selection of a place for setting up of a Van Dhan Kendra is dependent upon the area’s potential and availability of land to be provided by the State Government. The number of Van Dhan Kendras developed depends on the above factors.


    This information was given by Union Minister of State for Tribal Affairs Smt. Renuka Singh Saruta in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
