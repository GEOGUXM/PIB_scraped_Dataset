      The Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana â€“ National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) across the country in a mission mode with the objective of organizing the rural poor women into Self Help Groups (SHGs), and continuously nurturing and supporting them to take economic activities till they attain appreciable increase in income over a period of time to improve their quality of life and come out of abject poverty.


      Under DAY - NRLM programme, Revolving Funds (RF) at the rate of Rs.10,000-15,000 per SHG and Community Investment Fund (CIF) to the extent of Rs.2,50,000 per SHG is provided to Self Help Groups (SHGs) and their federations to take up self-employment for income generation and livelihoods activities. Apart from this DAY-NRLM also facilitates credit mobilisation for SHGs in the form of bank loans. In order to reduce the effective cost of bank credit to women SHGs, DAY-NRLM is providing interest subvention to SHGs on loans from banks from FinancialYear 2013-14. In addition, capacity building and technological support is also provided to the target households for taking up income generating activities both in farm and non-farm sectors.


      DAY-NRLM has following sub-schemes focussing on self-employment of the rural poor:


      Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs), enabling a trainee to take bank credit and start his/her own Micro-enterprise. Under RSETIs, opportunities are being made available to rural women by way of skill training with Entrepreneurship Development Programme (EDP) inputs to start self-employment ventures. The number of total candidates trained/settled, women candidates trained/settled during 2018-19 and 2019-20 (upto June, 2019) is given below:-
