    An exhibition on GAGANYAAN space suit and talking robot was inaugurated at Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM) here today. In order to launch the Gaganyaan project, the first of its kind, in 2022, ISRO has developed a space suit prototype. The orange-coloured suit prototype was developed over a period of two years at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram. With the ability to hold one oxygen cylinder, the suit will allow the astronaut to breathe in space for 60 minutes. ISRO has developed two suits and will create one more as three astronauts will be going into space in 2022.


    The talking Robot exhibit is made with the concept of speech processing, cloud computing and image processing technology. The robot starts interacting after recognizing the word “Computer” and records speech and sends it on cloud server to analyse it. It finds the words most closely correspond to the combination of individual sounds and indentifies key words to make sense of the tasks and carry out corresponding functions.


    BITM has also arranged live streaming of the soft landing of the Chandrayaan-2 lander carrying a rover from 12;30 am onwards on the night of September. 6, or early morning of September, 7, with feed from ISRO for general public at BITM.
