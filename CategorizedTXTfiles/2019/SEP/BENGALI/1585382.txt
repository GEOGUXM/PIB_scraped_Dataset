    Kolkata, September 17, 2019


    Hats off to the regional news unit of Doordarshan Kolkata-DD Bangla. It helped a 13-year old lost boy who was mentally ill too, named Sahil Shaw to get re-united with his parents Kartick and Suman Shaw after Kartick, a driver of a multinational courier service from Ahiritola area of the city traced him, watching the news bulletin telecasted on 10 pm at DD Bangla, last Saturday (September 14, 2019).


    Kartick Shaw, who was watching that bulletin at night identified his lost son who was among the inmates of a home for mentally unstable persons in Nadia named Nirmal Hriday run by Shri Moslem Munshi, an employee of State Sericulture department in that district’s Nakshipara area, contacted the sleuths of Anti Trafficking Wing of Lalbazar police Headquarters, who were probing the boy’s sudden disappearance since February 10, 2017. The sleuths in turn obtained detailed information from Doordarshan Kolkata’s news unit, particularly, from the correspondent who filed that story and got in touch with the home authority to trace Sahil.


    On Sunday, i.e., September 15, 2019 Kartick and his wife rushed to Nakshipara and re-united with his son after long 19 months.


    Kartick lodged a missing diary at Jorabagan police station of the city as soon as his son went missing. Later, the case was taken by Lalbazar’s Anti Human Trafficking Wing.


    The Nadia District administration rescued Sahil last year from Karimpur and initially kept at a home there. Later, he was taken to Nirmal Hriday through District Child Welfare Committee.
