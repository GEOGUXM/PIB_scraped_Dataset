    The Kolkata Customs Zone has initiated a Special Drive to clear pending Integrated GST (IGST) Refunds related to export. The exporters are being contacted through emails, letters and telephonically to rectify errors on account of mistake in EGM filling and Integration Errors vis-Ã -vis GST return. This follows the directions of the Union Finance Minister, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman to clear all pending Integrated GST (IGST) Refund claims within 30 days to the exporters.


    Kolkata Customs Zone has stated that the IGST Refund in few cases are pending due to certain errors committed by the exporters.

Accordingly, CBIC has extended the date of IGST Verification through Manual Mode (Officer Interface) upto July 07, 2019. Besides this, the pendency of IGST Refund Claim due to mismatch between GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B returns is also being resolved for Shipping Bills upto March 31, 2019. The Kolkata Customs (Port) has issued Public Notice 74/2019 dated August 08, 2019 in this regard.


    There has been good response to the Special Drive and exporters are submitting documents pending for IGST refund applications. On September 03, 2019 the first day of the Special Drive, 68 cases of IGST Refund were resolved.
