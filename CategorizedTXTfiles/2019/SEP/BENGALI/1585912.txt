      Posted On: 23 SEP 2019 6:29PM by PIB Kolkata


    Scientists of CSIR-CMERI has come up with an affordable technological solution that saves significant amount of energy along with easy identification of faults in street lights named âˆ’ Smart Dimmable LED Street Lighting Technology . The key feature of the technology is that it automatically increases the brightness of street lights when a pedestrian or bicycle or caris moving or present in the street and goes back to predefined diming state when none is present. The technology works in combination of the advanced motion sensors with dimmable LED drivers that makes on-demand dynamic lighting through adjustment of intensity of individual street lights that can varyfrom 10% to 100%. It softly enhances the brightness of forward lights so that the pedestrians or bicycles or cars get enough light well in advance. This ensures safety and comfort of pedestrian. Additionally, it automatically switches ON the street lights in the evening and OFF in the dawn, without the need for human intervention. Further, it is tolerant from undesirable trigger in light demand when animals such as cats, dogs etc., passes by.


    CSIR-CMERI has transferred the Smart Dimmable LED Street Lighting Technology to M/s Koley Engineering Works , Howrah, WB on 21 September 2019.
