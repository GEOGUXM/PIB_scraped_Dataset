US and Indian soldiers stood side by side, and gave a ceremonial salute to the two senior most officers of the US and Indian side reviewing the ceremony.


    The US contingent was represented by a company of 5-20 Infantry Battalion of the US Army while the Indian side was representing The Assam Regiment. Major General Xavier Brunsen , US Army welcomed the Indian soldiers, and in his inaugural remarks highlighted the common shared beliefs of democracy, freedom, equality and justice that are precious to both nations.
