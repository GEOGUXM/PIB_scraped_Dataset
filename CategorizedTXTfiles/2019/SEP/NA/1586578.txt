    The Minister, who is on a visit to Russia to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting also, inaugurated a special day-long seminar organised to pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi as part of 150 years of celebrating the Mahatma.


    Addressing the gathering, Mr Javadekar said Leo Tolstoy had a great influence on Mahatma Gandhi. "Leo Tolstoy's message of love, no greed and truth found resonance in Gandhi Ji's thought process," the Minister said, adding â€œGandhi ji wrote five letters to Tolstoy and sought his guidance. Gandhi Ji was then in his 40s and was working as a Lawyer and activist in South Africa then and Tolstoy was in his 80s."
