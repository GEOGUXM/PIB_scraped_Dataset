    Speaking on the occasion, the President said that Mahatma Gandhi had understood very well that emphasis on spiritual values is essential for establishment of peace and non-violence in the world. He made it clear that the uplift human society is only possible on the foundation of truth, non-violence, peace and harmony. These thoughts of Gandhiji are relevant even today, and will remain relevant in future as well.


    The President said that Gandhian values are relevant to address a range of contemporary issues our world is facing, such as terrorism, violence, corruption, immorality, discrimination based on - religion, race, language, - and climate-change. The global community will benefit from following the path shown by Gandhiji.
