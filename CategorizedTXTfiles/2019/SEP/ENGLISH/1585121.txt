    Indian Railways will undertake one more drive of “MASSIVE SHRAMDAN“ with main focus on “COLLECTION OF PLASTIC WASTE”. This is to be done on this Tuesday, the 17th September, 2019. In the recent past such drives are being undertaken by Railways. This Shramadan is for:-

      * Enhanced cleanliness, through collection of plastic waste from all railway premises. Particular attention to be given to approaches to stations
      * Creating awareness for a greater impact against single use plastic.
      * Displaying Replacements/ Substitutes for such plastic items.
      * For distributing Cloth bags in large numbers as advised by the Environment and Housekeeping Management Division of Railways through its letter dated 12.9.2019.
      * Educating all in Railways, including vendors to be prepared for ban of single use plastic with effect from 02.10.2019. Single use plastic means usage of any plastic below 50 microns, in any manner.

    The Prime Minister had specially desired that Indian Railways should lead this initiative. Accordingly the Minister for Railways had directed a 10 days cleanliness drive earlier for trains and stations starting 2 nd September, 2019. The Minister had been monitoring photos relating to several such drives being uploaded on E-Drishti and other dashboards. He had been encouraging those Railway Divisions performing well on Swachhata too. Indian Railways due to such serious efforts, to make cleanliness its work culture, had won the Best Union Ministry Swachhata award for 2018-19 presented by the President of India on the last Friday-6th September, 2019.


    Further, Indian Railways is undertaking various activities relating to Swachhata Pakhwada from 11th September to 2nd October, 2019, leading to Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary on that Day, which would be observed as Community Service day, involving participation of all stake holders, to make a visible impact on cleanliness. The Chairman Railway Board had also continuously been in touch with all Divisional heads to emphasize on the subject. He has asked all Divisional Heads to provide plastic bottle crushing machines, at over four thousand- A1 & A2 stations by the 2 nd October, 2019.


    Meanwhile, the Railway Board has also sent a letter to all Divisional Heads, directing that this MASSIVE SHRAMADAN on the 17th September, 2019 should be arranged at each and every station and nearby localities, approaches to the stations, and in areas near tracks all over the country. Senior most officials at the stations and at all other levels of Indian Railways are asked to lead the SHRAMDAAN- involving participation of all railway employees, their families, railway pensioners, and all other stakeholders and self help groups. Charitable organizations are also to be requested to participate in the drive. Trade unions may also be actively involved, to make it a success. A report, including photographs, is asked to be submitted to the Environment and Housekeeping Management Division of Railways.


    A competition on Plastic Waste Management at Railway station is to be launched at the Divisional level followed by General Manager’s level. Best Zone / Division will be assessed by Railway Board based on the report submitted by Zones / Divisions.
