    Annual Refresher Programme in Teaching (ARPIT) –


    Ministry of Human Resource Development launched Annual Refresher Programme in Teaching (ARPIT) in November, 2018. ARPIT is a major and unique initiative of online professional development of 1.5 million higher education faculty using the MOOCs platform SWAYAM. For implementing ARPIT, discipline-specific National Resource Centers (NRCs) are identified which are tasked to prepare online training material with focus on latest developments in the discipline, new & emerging trends, pedagogical improvements and methodologies for transacting revised curriculum.


    For ARPIT 2019, 51 discipline specific NRCs have been notified covering 46 disciplines, such as, Agriculture, Law, Architecture, Social Sciences, Sciences, Engineering and Technology, Geography, Home Science, Tribal studies, Commerce, Library and Information sciences, Curriculum development, Humanities, Language Teaching in Sanskrit, Urdu, Hindi and English, Pharmacy, Skill development, Textile Technology, Management, Public Policy, Leadership & Governance, Library & Information Science, Astronomy & Astrophysics, Assessment and Evaluation, Pedagogy and research methods, Climate Change etc. The training materials have now been uploaded and made available through SWAYAM to all the teachers from 1 st September, 2019. Currently, registrations are open for the online refresher courses on SWAYAM platform, India’s own indigenous MOOC’s education engine and can be accessed https://swayam.gov.in/explorer?category=ARPIT


    As on date, the enrolment for ARPIT 2019 is around 48,000. As part of popularizing ARPIT, NIC has sent bulk mails/SMS to all faculties in the relevant disciplines, which covers around 10 lakh faculty in HEIs.


    In the inaugural year 2018, 75 NRCs were notified to cover a range of courses in different disciplines of Social Sciences, Sciences, Engineering and Technology, Design & Manufacturing, Humanities, Language Teaching, Commerce, Management, Education Planning and Administration, Public Policy, Leadership & Governance, Library & Information Science, Astronomy & Astrophysics, Assessment and Evaluation, Pedagogy and research methods, cutting edge areas of Nano-sciences, Internet of Things, etc.


    Through ARPIT all in-service teachers, irrespective of their subject and seniority have been given an enabling opportunity to keep abreast of the latest developments in their disciplines through the technology based online refresher courses. Faculty can benefit from this initiative as it is highly flexible and can be done at one’s own pace and time. The NRCs will revolutionize professional development of faculty by catering to massive numbers by leveraging ICT and online technology platform of SWAYAM.


    The NRCs initially develop a 3 minute video(s) which is assessed technically by AICTE and after having met the MOOC guidelines; the same have been approved and uploaded on SWAYAM Portal. The course is a 40 hour module with 20 hours of video content and 20 hours of non-video content. They are offered in a highly flexible format and can be done at one’s own pace and time. There are built-in assessment exercises and activities as part of the academic progression in the course. At the end of the course, they will be a terminal assessment which will be an online examination in a proctored environment conducted by the National Testing Agency. All faculties who have successfully completed the online refresher course will be certified.


    All in-service teachers, irrespective of their subject and seniority are requested to register and complete these refresher courses which will help them in career advancement. ARPIT course of 40 hours/duration is treated as equivalent to one Refresher Course for Career Advancement Scheme (CAS) for promotion (UGC communication No. F.2-16/2002(PS) Pt.fI.II dated 3rd December, 2018)


    A varied set of institutions such as, Centers under the Ministry’s Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya National Mission on Teachers and Teaching (PMMMNMTT) located in Central Universities, IISc, IUCAA, IITs, IISERs, NITs, State Universities; UGC’s Human Resource Development Centres( HRDCs), National Institutes for Technical Teachers Training (NITTTRs), IIITs have been notified as NRCs.
