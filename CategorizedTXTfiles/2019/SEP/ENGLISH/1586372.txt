    Prime Minister reiterated India's support for giving priority to diplomacy, dialogue and confidence building in the interest of maintaining peace, security and stability in the Gulf region, which is of vital importance for India.
    
    It was agreed to mark the 70th Anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations in 2020.
