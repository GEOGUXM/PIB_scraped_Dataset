    Recognising the importance of nurturing innovation and creativity in a knowledge economy, India is taking great strides in strengthening its intellectual property ecosystem.


    Further, given the key role played by MSMEs in the economic growth of India, it is proposed to reduce the fees for various IPRs as follows:

Multi-pronged strategies have been used to address the issue of pendency in IP applications, including manifold augmentation of manpower and streamlining of procedures. These strategies have paid rich dividends, and there has been a sharp jump in the disposal of IP applications:
