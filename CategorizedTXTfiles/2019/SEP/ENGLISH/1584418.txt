    Bharat Mata Ki Jai!


    Bharat Mata Ki Jai!


    Bharat Mata Ki Jai!


    You are the people who live for Maa Bharti and for her victory. You are the people who fight for Maa Bharti's victory. You are the ones who have passion for Maa Bharti. You spend your entire life and dreams so that Maa Bharti’s head is held high.


    Friends,


    I could understand your state of mind last night. Your eyes said a lot, I was able to read the sorrow on your face and hence I did not stay amongst you for long. You have not slept for several nights, yet I thought of calling you again and talking to you in the morning. Everyone associated with this mission was in a different state of mind. There were many unanswered questions. You moved forward with a great success. But suddenly nothing was visible. I too have lived that moment with you. When the communication was lost, you were all shaken. I was watching everything. A natural question came to the mind - Why did that happen? How did that happen? And the mind of a scientist works similarly. He starts everything with a 'why'. There were a lot of expectations. I realized that even after that you had hopes because your hard work was behind everything and you have developed it every moment taking care of all the nuances.


    Friends,


    Today, even though there have been some obstacles and challenges, but this has not weakened our spirits rather strengthened it. Today, even though one last hurdle has appeared on our path in the end, it has not deterred us from the path of our destination. Today even though we could not go through our plan of touching the surface of the moon, and if a poet has to write today's event, the literature has to be written, the writer would describe the moon in a romantic way. But the language of science is different. The description had assimilated even in the nature of Chandrayaan. And so the Chandrayaan raced to embrace the moon. The poet would say the same. Today our will to touch the moon and our determination to reach the moon has been further strengthened.


    Sisters and brothers of India, my scientist friends, for the last few hours the entire nation was awake. We were awake in solidarity with our scientists, who had embarked on one of the most ambitious missions of our space program.


    We came very close but we will need to cover more ground in the times to come. Every Indian is filled with a spirit of pride as well as confidence. We are proud of our space program and scientists, their hard work and determination has ensured a better life not only for our citizens but also for other nations.


    It is the outcome of their innovative zeal that several people have got access to a better quality of life including better Health Care and education facilities. India is certain that there will be many more opportunities to be proud and rejoice, thanks.


    At the same time, we are full of confidence that when it comes to our space program the best is yet to come.


    There are new frontiers to discover and new places to go. We will rise to the occasion and scale newer heights of success.


    To our scientists I want to say India is with you. You are exceptional professionals who have made an incredible contribution to national progress.


    You have given your best always and will give us several more opportunities to smile. True to your nature you ventured into a place where no one had ever ventured before.


    You are the people who leave your impression on a rock.


    You came as close as you could. Stay steady and look ahead. I also salute the families of our space scientists. Their silent but valuable support remains a major asset.


    Sisters and brothers of India resilience and tenacity are Central to India’s ethos. In our glorious history of thousands of years we have faced moments that may have slowed us but they have never crushed our spirit. We have bounced back again and gone to do spectacular things. This is the reason our civilization stands tall.


    My dear friends as important as the final result, is the journey and the effort. I can proudly say that the effort was worth it and so was the journey. Our team worked hard, traveled far and those teachings will always remain with us. We will look back at the journey and effort with great satisfaction. The learning from today will make us stronger and better. There will be a new dawn and a brighter tomorrow very soon.


    Friends, it has also been our tradition and culture to continuously move towards the goals without being disappointed by the results. Our thousands of years old history is full of such examples. Despite the initial disruptions, we have achieved historical results.


    ISRO itself is a living example of the culture of never giving up. If we had stopped by our initial problems and challenges, today ISRO would not have become one of the world's leading space agencies.


    Friends,


    Getting desired result is one thing. But me and the entire nation is proud of the efforts of all the scientists and engineers. I had told you at night and I am reiterating it again that I am with you, the nation is with you.


    Friends,


    Every problem, every struggle, or every challenge teaches us something new. These inspire for some new inventions and new technology. And this determines our success ahead. I anyway believe that the greatest teacher of knowledge is science. There is no failure in science; there are only experiments and efforts. Every experiment and every effort sows new seeds of knowledge. It lays the foundation for new possibilities and makes us realize our immense potential.


    Friends,


    The last lap of Chandrayaan's journey may not have been as per our expectation, but we also have to remember that Chandrayaan's journey has been a spectacular one; it has been lively. The country has rejoiced several times during this entire mission. Our nation is feeling immense pride at this moment as the Orbiter is whirring around the moon. I myself have been seeking information related to the status of Chandrayaan every time whether I was in the country or abroad during this entire mission.


    Friends,


    India is one of the important space powers in the world. So all of you who have worked in ISRO and we're behind this programme have put your hard work and contribution to it. It is you who have hoisted the flag of India on Mars in your very first attempt. Earlier, no such achievement was made in the world. Our Chandrayaan gave the world important information about aspects like water on the moon. It was with your efforts that we created a new record by launching more than a hundred satellites simultaneously. When ISRO has encyclopedia of successes, your flight cannot be out of trajectory just because of one or two interruptions.


    Friends,


    Our culture and our thinking are full of what we say and what we believe - 'Vayam Amrutasya putra'. We are children of nectar; or nectar is associated with us. There is neither any hindrance nor any disappointment for the children of nectar. We do not have to turn back and be disappointed. We have to take lessons, learn, keep moving forward and never stop until the goal is achieved. We will certainly succeed; we will be successful in our next mission as well as in every effort thereafter.


    No momentary obstacle can stop us from fulfilling India's dreams and aspirations in the 21st century. I wish you all the best for every mission in the future. And as I said earlier, science is never satisfied with results. The inherent quality of science is effort, effort and effort. Even from the result, one seeks opportunities for a new endeavour. One does not stop with the result. Nor does one bow down to the result and these are inherent in your values. And that's why the country is proud of you. I too believe in you; your dreams are higher than mine; your resolutions are deeper than mine. Your potential to kiss the accomplishments is greater than mine and that is why I trust your confidence completely. Actually I have not come here to preach. I have come here in the morning to seek inspiration from you. You are a sea of ​​inspiration, a living form of inspiration. And so this is a moment of inspiration for me; where the scientific mind converts despair into hope; where dreams sprout into scientific accomplishment, and so I congratulate this team of friends dedicated to such a powerful, zealous and determined accomplishment.


    Thanks a lot!


    Bharat Mata Ki Jai! Bharat Mata Ki Jai! Bharat Mata Ki Jai!


    Thanks a lot!
