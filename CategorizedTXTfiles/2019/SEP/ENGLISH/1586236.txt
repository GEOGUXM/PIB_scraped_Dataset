    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:


         1. Crude oil production by ONGC during August, 2019 was 1716.89 TMT which is 4.81% lower than the target and 3.73% lower when compared with August, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-August, 2019 was 8584.63 TMT which is 2.0% and 4.24% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * ESP issues in wells of NBP field and Ratna R-series.

      * Increase in water cut in certain wells of Heera, Neelam, Mumbai High and B173A fields.
      * Sub-sea leakage in some well fluid lines of MH and NH Asset leading to flow restriction. NH Asset well fluid lines have been put back in operation after repair/replacement jobs. Repairing of well fluid lines of MH Asset is in progress.

         1. Crude oil production by OIL during August, 2019 was 274.34 TMT which is 5.16% lower than monthly target and 4.19% lower when compared with August, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-August, 2019 was 1354.79 TMT which is 4.30% lower than target for the period and 4.01% lower than production during the corresponding period of last year. Major reasons for lower production is less than planned contribution from workover wells and drilling wells.


         1. Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during August, 2019 was 758.68 TMT which is 9.01% lower than the monthly target and 9.51% lower than August, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-August, 2019 was 3786.10 TMT which is 8.17% lower than target for the period and 10.61% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * RJ-ON-90/1 (CEIL): Deficit is from Mangla due to delay in on lining of 45 Fatehgarh-Mangla-1 & 4 infill wells, ESP failure, drilling & work over activities and water leakage.

      * Operational issues in Bhagyam, Aishwarya and ABH fields.
      * CB-ONN-2005/9 (Mercator): Oil production from Jyoti-1 is stopped. Well closed for long term pressure build up study and could not be put back in production due to non-grant of EC for development campaign.
      * Jyoti-2 under WO from 31.03.19.

     1. Natural gas production during August, 2019 was 2688.23 MMSCM which is 7.18% lower than the monthly target and 3.58% lower when compared with August, 2018. Cumulative natural gas production during April-August, 2019 was 13437.00 MMSCM which is 5.49% lower than target for the period and 0.98% lower than production during corresponding period of last year Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II . Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of August, 2019 and cumulatively for the period April-August, 2019 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

    Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production


         1. Natural gas production by ONGC during August, 2019 was 2007.24 MMSCM which is 5.53% lower than target and 2.59% lower when compared with August 2018. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC during April-August, 2019 was 10158.29 MMSCM which is 1.46% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year but 3.35% lower than the cumulative target. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * Less gas production from Bassein and Satellite Asset due to de-optimization of certain wells.

      * Less off take from VA-S1 field in Eastern Offshore due to outage of GPPC and subsequent less offtake by M/s GAIL since 25th Aug’2019.
      * Less off take by consumers /Shut downs/ marketing issues.
      * Pressure decline in Pasarlapudi, Kesavadasupalem &Mandapeta fields in Rajahmundry and in Kuthalam& Kali fields in Cauvery Asset.

         1. Natural gas production by OIL during August, 2019 was 236.93 MMSCM which is 17.78% lower than monthly target and marginally lower by 0.02% when compared with August, 2018. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-August, 2019 was 1152.66 MMSCM which is 1.34% higher than the production during the corresponding period of last year but 18.77% lower than the cumulative target. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * Loss of potential in Deohal area due to presence of CO 2 in production stream.

      * Environmental loss (Bandh and miscreant activities).
      * Namrup Plant-II shut down due to disruption in process line of synthesis gas boiler outlet.

         1. Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during August, 2019 was 444.06 MMSCM which is 8.11% lower than monthly target and 9.46% lower than August, 2018. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-August, 2019 was 2126.05 MMSCM which is 7.06% lower than the cumulative target and 12.19% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * KG-DWN-98/3 (RIL): MA field ceased production and closure of 2 wells in D1D3 field.

      * KG-OSN-2001/3 (ONGC): Delay in anticipated production from well DDW D-5.
      * RJ-ON/6(FEL): Less offtake by customer.
      * Raniganj East CBM Block (ESSAR): Major customer 'Matix' operational shutdown. Also restricted production to avoid flaring.

     1. Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)


    Refinery production during August, 2019 was 21952.67 TMT which is 0.14% higher than the target for the month and 2.40% higher when compared with August, 2018. Cumulative production during April-August, 2019 was 106313.27 TMT which is 0.72% lower than the target for the period and 1.39% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III . Company-wise production for the month of August, 2019 and cumulatively for the period April-August, 2019 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

         1. CPSE Refineries’ production during August, 2019 was 12492.89 TMT which is 0.37% lower than the target for the month but 0.29% higher when compared with August, 2018. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-August, 2019 was 60440.27 TMT which is 1.94% lower than the target for the period and 3.28% lower than the production during corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


      * IOCL, Gujarat: Lower due to AU-3 and AU-4 idled due to heavy rain and water logging , AU-5 idled due to high HSD stocks

      * IOCL, Haldia: Lower due to interruption in processing due to power failure
      * IOCL, Paradip: Lower due to high VR/VGO stocks.
      * IOCL, Bongaigaon: Lower due to crude receipt
      * IOCL, Panipat: Lower due to deferment of planned shutdown.
      * HPCL, Visakh: Lower due to interruption in crude supplies on account of SPM non-availability due to hose leak.

    3.2 Production in JV refineries during August, 2019 was 1655.07 TMT which is 4.22% higher than the target for the month and 39.28% higher when compared with August, 2018. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-August, 2019 was 8505.54 TMT which is 8.48% higher than the target for the period and 10.38% higher than the production during corresponding period of last year.


    3.3 Production in private refineries during August, 2019 was 7804.71 TMT which is higher by 0.15% than the target both for the month and corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-August, 2019 was 37367.46 TMT which is lower by 0.64% than the target and corresponding period of last year.


      3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of August, 2019 and cumulatively for the period April-August, 2019 vis-à-vis April-August, 2018 are given at Annexures - IV and V respectively.
