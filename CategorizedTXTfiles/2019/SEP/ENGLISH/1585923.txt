      Government amends Rule 54 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972
      Posted On: 23 SEP 2019 6:46PM by PIB Delhi


    On death of a Government servant while in service, the family is entitled to a family pension in accordance with Rule 54 of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972. The family pension was payable at enhanced rate of 50% of the pay last drawn for a period of 10 years, if the Government servant had rendered a continuous service of not less than seven years; thereafter the rate of family pension was 30% of the pay last drawn. In case the Government servant had rendered a service of less than seven years before his death, the rate of family pension was 30% from the beginning and family pension at enhanced rate of 50% of last pay drawn was not payable to the family.


    The Government felt that the need for family pension at enhanced rate is more in the case of a Government servant who dies early in his career, as his pay at the initial phase of service is much less. The Government has, therefore, amended Rule 54 of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 by a notification dated 19 th September, 2019. As per the amended Rule 54, the family of a Government servant, who dies within seven years of joining service, will also be eligible for family pension at enhanced rate of 50% of last pay drawn, for a period of 10 years.


    The above amendment would be effective from 1 st October, 2019. However, the families of Government servants who died before completion of service of seven years within 10 years before 1 st October, 2019, will also be eligible for family pension at enhanced rates with effect from 1 st October, 2019.


    The benefit of amended provisions would be available to the families of all Government servants, including the personnel of CAPFs, in the unfortunate event of their death within seven years of joining Government service.
