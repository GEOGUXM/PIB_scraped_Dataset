    The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has asserted that Kashmir was a settled issue as every inch belonged to India and there was nothing more to discuss.


    Inaugurating Platinum Jubilee Celebrations of BHS Higher Education Society, in Bengaluru today, he said that the dilution of Article 370 was a national issue and not a political issue as it concerned the unity, safety, security and integrity of the nation.


    Pointing out that elections were being regularly held in Jammu and Kashmir and MPs, MLAs and Sarpanchs to local bodies were getting elected, he said the reorganization of the Jammu and Kashmir was an internal matter. “We don’t want to interfere in the internal affairs of any country and we don’t anybody else to interfere in our affairs”, he added.


    Criticizing a neighboring country for aiding, abetting, training and funding terror, he said that India always believed in having peaceful relations with all countries, including her neighbours.
