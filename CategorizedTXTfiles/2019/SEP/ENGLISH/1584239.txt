    The Ministry of HRD has taken various steps to implement the scheme of Institutions of Eminence (IoEs). On 4th September 2019, the Ministry of Human Resource Development, on the advice of UGC and the Empowered Expert Committee issued orders to 5 public Universities conveying their declaration as Institutions of Eminence (IoE). These are IIT Madras, Banaras Hindu University, IIT Kharagpur, University of Delhi and University of Hyderabad.

    Further, in respect of 2 more Universities , Shiv Nadar University, UP and O.P Jindal University, Haryana letters were issued to the State Government to pass legislation in the State Assembly to cease the status of these Universities as Private Universities under the State and so as to enable them to be considered as IoE Deemed Universities.
