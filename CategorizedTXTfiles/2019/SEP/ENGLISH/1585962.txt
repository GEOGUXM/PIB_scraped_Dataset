    World leaders have gathered in New York today for the United Nations Secretary General (UNSG) Climate Action Summit. The Summit is being called by UNSG Mr. António Guterres to ramp up climate actions worldwide.

    What is needed today, is a comprehensive approach which covers everything from education to values, and from lifestyle to developmental philosophy”.


    Bringing attention towards India’s efforts in always following a climate sensitive sustainable development pathway by mainstreaming climate change concerns in development policies, Shri Narendra Modi stated “Need, not greed has been our guiding principle.

    · Industry Transition: transforming industries such as oil and gas, steel, cement, chemicals and information technology;


    · Nature-Based Solutions: reducing emissions, increasing sink capacity and enhancing resilience within and across forestry, agriculture, oceans and food systems, including through biodiversity conservation, leveraging supply chains and technology;


    · Cities and Local Action: advancing mitigation and resilience at urban and local levels, with a focus on new commitments on low-emission buildings, mass transport and urban infrastructure; and resilience for the urban poor;


    · Resilience and Adaptation: advancing global efforts to address and manage the impacts and risks of climate change, particularly in those communities and nations most vulnerable.


    · Mitigation Strategy: to generate momentum for ambitious NDCs and longterm strategies to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.
