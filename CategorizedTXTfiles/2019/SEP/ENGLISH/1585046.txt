The Planning Conference for the CORPAT was conducted on 05 September 2019 at Phuket, Thailand.


    Indian Naval Ship Kesari, an amphibious Landing Ship Tank (Large), commanded by Commander Mukesh Tayal, along with Indian Naval Maritime Patrol Dornier aircraft, participated from the Indian Navy. During the sea phase of the CORPAT from 06 to 12 September 2019, units of both the navies undertook coordinated maritime patrolling in their respective sectors of the International Maritime Boundary Line. In addition, the participating ships and aircraft undertook joint exercises including Ship Boarding operations, Search and Rescue exercise, coordinated maneuvers at sea, etc. Upon arrival at Port Blair, Rear Admiral Wittanarat Gajaseni along with RTN delegates called on Maj Gen Beji Mathews, Chief of Staff at Headquarters Andaman and Nicobar Command. The subsequent programme includes debrief of the sea phase, sports fixtures, local sightseeing and professional interaction between naval personnel of both the nations.


    Indian Naval assets have been increasingly deployed in recent times to address the main maritime concerns of the region. In addition, the Indian Navy has also been involved in assisting countries in the Indian Ocean Region with EEZ Surveillance, Search and Rescue and other capacity-building and capability-enhancement activities. The current deployment is in consonance with Indian Navy’s efforts to consolidate inter-operability and forge strong bonds of friendship across the seas.


    The 28 th cycle of Indo-Thai CORPAT seeks to underscore India’s peaceful presence and solidarity with friendly and harmonious countries towards ensuring good order in the maritime domain and to strengthen existing bonds between India and Thailand.
