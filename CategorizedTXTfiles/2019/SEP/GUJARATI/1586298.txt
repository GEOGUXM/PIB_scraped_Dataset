Acting upon the above said intelligence, the officers of the DGGI, Zonal Unit, Surat searched the premises on 25.09.2019 at three places related to these firms located in the City of Surat. During the course of search, it was found that the above said firms are engaged in clandestine clearance of the taxable goods by raising parallel invoices to the actual supply and thus evading the payment of GST in the process. The value of the offending goods so cleared without payment of GST and without proper GST invoices has been ascertained to the tune of more than Rupees five Crore, as per the preliminary estimates. The taxpayer voluntary accepted the GST liability and made part payment on the spot with promise to pay the remaining amount shortly. Further investigation going on in this case.
