      North East Region Income Tax Department Launches Publicity Campaign to Create Public Awareness
      Posted On: 30 JAN 2019 11:33AM by PIB Guwahati


    A dedicated publicity campaign to create public awareness has been launched on 26 th January, 2019 by the Income Tax Department, North East Region (NER) regarding income tax obligations of people in the region throughHoardings, Standees plus video clips.


    There is a general incorrect impression that all incomes of tribal persons / non-individuals such as partnerships, LLPs, companies etc., are exempt. Incomes of all entities other than individuals, and incomes of tribal persons outside scheduled areas, are subject to Income Tax. In fact, it is only the income earned in the scheduled area by such tribal persons, which is exempt. The campaign will make the people aware of such provisions.


    Further the campaign also aims at highlighting the various new provisions prohibiting certain types of transactions, particularly cash transactions, which attract stiff penalties. Since NER has low banking coverage, people may inadvertently enter into the prohibited transactions and thus become exposed to penal provisions. The campaign will help the people understand and avoid such prohibited transactions.


    The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016 imposes obligations on taxpayers and others not to indulge in certain types of transactions or to report such transactions. There are serious penal and prosecution consequences for entering into such transactions. The campaign seeks to spread awareness about such laws and prohibitions / obligations thereunder.


    This is for the first time that such dedicated campaign has been launched in NER for the benefit of the tax payers in the Region.
