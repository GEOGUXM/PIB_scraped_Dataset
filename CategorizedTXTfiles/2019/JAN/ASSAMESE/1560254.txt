    Launched in April 2016, Swachhata Pakhwada is an initiative under the Swachh Bharat Mission. It is inspired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi's vision to engage all Union Ministries and Departments in Swachhata-related activities, thereby making Swachhata a regular practice for everyone.


    The Swachh Bharat Mission is now in its final year of implementation with the rural sanitation coverage having increased from 39% at the launch, in October 2014, to over 98% at present.
