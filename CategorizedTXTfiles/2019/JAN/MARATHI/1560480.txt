    Mahararashtraâ€™s Under-21 girls scripted a 33-27 win over West Bengal while in the Under-17 category they went down to Uttar Pradesh by a narrow 30-31 margin in Khelo India Youth Games Kabaddi action here on Monday.


    In the Under-21 match, Sonali Helvi, Srushti Chalake and Aasawari Kachare were impressive and helped Maharashtra take a 19-12 lead in the first half. In the second half, Bengal went for bonus points to reduce the margin but the Maharashtra girls kept them at bay in the last five minutes.


    In contrast, Maharashtra led 26-22 in the Under-17 category. Uttar Pradesh then turned the tables and led 30-28, with just one minute left for the final whistle. At this point, the electronic scoreboard stopped working but officials kept the game going by putting up the scores by hand.


    At the final whistle, the teams were tied 30-30 but the officials awarded technical point to Uttar Pradesh and declared them winners.


    Later in the evening session, Maharashtra went down to Punjab 24-20 in a close encounter in an Under-21 boys group match.
