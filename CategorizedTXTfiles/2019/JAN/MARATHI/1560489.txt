    Maharashtra’s Mitika Gunele, Haryana’s Raj Sahiba and Manipur’s Babyrojisana Chanu justified their international reputation by comfortably entering into the semi-finals of their weight categories in the Girls under-17 boxing here at the Khelo India Youth Games.


    Mitika, a gold medalist of 7 th Nations Cup in Serbia in 2018 got the better of Haryana’s Anu Rani 4-1 in welter (66kg) category while Raj Sahiba, a Khelo India and the Nations Cup gold medalist (2018) defeated Haryana’s Divya, after referee stopped the bout in 2 nd round. In the same category, Babyrojisana Chanu, a student of legendary Mary Kom, booked her place in the last four. Chanu is gold medalist of Junior Asian Championship and 7 th Nations Cup held last year.


    Among under-17 boys, Pune’s Akash Gorkha confirmed his medal by entering into last-four in the feather (57kg) category. A vocal crowd from Boys Sports Company was present at the venue to cheer him. Taking advantage of his lanky and lean body structure, Aakash rained punches on his opponent and scripted an easy victory.


    Akash’s father Ramesh works as watchman in Pune and he didn’t want his son to follow his footsteps so enrolled his name in the Nehru stadium Boxing academy. Under the watchful eyes of coach Umesh Jagdale, Akash excelled in the sport quickly and started performing at the state and national tournament. He also won a silver medal in the 7 th Asian Cup in Serbia.


    Aakash who is currently training with Army Sports Institute, Pune feels that the training under Army coaches is too intense and surely played a role in his performance in the Khelo India.


    “I don’t have to worry about anything. We just put ourselves best during the training and during the bouts. That’s what we have been told and I am following the same,” he said.
