    The Government of India and industry players have entered into agreements whereby the Government will link textile companies and handloom clusters, enabling the textile firms to directly source their requirements for handlooms from handloom clusters. The strategic partnership between big brands and handloom clusters is aimed at establishing long-term market linkages between key industry players on the one hand and handloom weavers on the other; this will ensure sustainable development of the sector, resulting also in sustainable and enhanced income opportunities for weavers.


    The MoUs were signed at Aritsan Speak, a unique event organized by the Ministry of Textiles, Government of India, at the UNESCO World Heritage site Elephanta Caves near Mumbai today. The event has been held to showcase the GI Textiles of India, through a confluence of fashion, music and dance. The Union Minister for Textiles, Smt. Smriti Zubin Irani; Secretary, Textiles, Shri Raghvendra Singh and other officials from the Ministry were present on the occasion. Former Indian cricketer Shri Sachin Tendulkar was present, on behalf of Arvind True Blue Limited.


    Addressing the gathering, the Textiles Minister Smt. Smriti Zubin Irani said: "Grateful to industry captains for stepping up to this initiative under the aegis of the Ministry of Textiles. The Textiles Secretary has been speaking about the need to explore synergy between our culture and our textiles. We are now standing at a site where 2000 years ago, people built something without the aid of technology, something which depicts pure passion and love for craft. The statues in Cave I depict creases of the cloth that someone then presumed a deity would wear. That is the culture and history that we celebrate today. I am grateful to Shri Sachin Tendulkar for partnering with weavers and the textile legacy of our country, as he begins a new chapter. Instead of profiting alone, he has chosen to share the profit with the community that has built the craft legacy of our country."


    The Minister spoke of the MoUs signed today. She said that in Kumbh Mela, Goenka Group made something disposable using technical textiles so that even the poorest of the poor can use it. This reflects the diversity and capacity of our country, she said. "Grateful to designers for measuring up and for sharing the stage with weavers who have been celebrated but often forgotten, and for letting their light shine. Thanks to Union Culture Minister Dr. Mahesh Sharma and to ASI which has opened its caves and hearts for us."


    Shri Sachin Tendulkar said, "I have always been wanting to come here as a schoolkid, but could not due to various reasons. Today is a special day and a proud moment for me. India is very diverse, with huge variations in the clothing, food habits and language of its people. Despite this, one of the few things which have kept us together is our craftsmanship; our weavers have been able to restore our tradition, creativity and skill which we have always been known for. I thank the Textiles Minister for this initiative; the weavers have been facing a lot of challenges due to introduction of fancy new machineries. The actual skill has been challenged, for which India is known for. India might be the only country where handmade articles are way cheaper, while in other countries it is way costlier. The reason for this, I think is that handmade articles are made from the heart; this makes us recipients of the blessings of weavers. Coming to partnership, this is a great one. We have 4.3 million people involved in the sector, second largest to agriculture. The partnerships will help us setting standards globally. Like the "Men in Blue", I am confident that this partnership will enable us to reach out to various parts or the world and show what India has been known for. I am confident that this journey will be a wonderful one and am looking forward to watching the showcase of Indian textiles today. Thank you very much for inviting me".

    Background


    India’s handlooms are a generational legacy closely associated with the cultural tradition and rich history of our country. The tradition is kept alive by our highly skilled weavers and artisans against all odds and uneven competition from machine-made products. Kancheepuram of Tamil Nadu, Baluchari and Jamdani of West Bengal, Paithani of Maharashtra, Chanderi and Maheswari of Madhya Pradesh, Muga of Assam, Patola of Gujarat, Kani of Kashmir, Tie & Dye, Vichitrapuri and Bomkai of Orissa, Brocades of Varanasi, Balarampuram of Kerala and Pochampally of Andhra Pradesh are a few examples of our precious handloom tradition.


    The G overnment has taken various steps to preserve this legacy and to unlock the commercial potential and huge possibility for rural employment through revival of these age-old crafts. Patenting exclusive crafts with GI registration is one such step which holds great promise for economic and social upliftment of weavers and artisans. About 168 handlooms and handicrafts products have been registered under GI. Artisan Speak will mark another step in this direction, wherein GI textiles will be showcased and private sector will enter into collaboration with the Government in promoting India’s handlooms.
