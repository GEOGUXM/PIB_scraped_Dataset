    Maharashtra’s Under-21 girls brightened their chances of making it to the knock-out stage easing past Andhra Pradesh 31-19 in the KIYG kabaddi event.


    For the hosts, Sonali Helvi did well to help build up a 12-9 lead with some good tackles and great raids.


    Later, the hosts were subjected to losses in the Under-21 boys and Under-17 girl’s sections respectively.


    The State’s boys suffered a heart-breaking single point loss to Kerala 34-35 despite beginning well and leading 12-10 initially. At half-time, Maharashtra trailed 14-15. On resumption, Maharashtra’s defence let them down and trailed 22-32.


    With just five minutes to go, the home team bounced back, cut the deficit, levelling at 34-all into the last minute. However, a successful tackle by the Kerala defence did them in.


    Later, the girls were outdone by Haryana 17-37.
