    Day 3 - PadYatraRoute:


    Mayadhar - Pingari - Lakhawada - Anida - Mandavda - Bhutiya - Shetrunji Dam


    Yesterday Shri Raghavjibhai Dhabi, well known educationist addressed the Fourth Mahavrat Sabha at Mayadhar on the topic “Swadeshi”. In his speech, he said, “Swadeshi is the true love for the nations, it is where even the last man gets work and uplifts himself. PujyaGandhibapu highly insisted on Swadeshi as that was a way to develop India in a better way.”


    Today morning, Union Minister Shri Mansukh Mandaviya and other Padyatris joined the local residents for ‘Prabhatferi’ and to clean the village. After the cleanliness program, the PadYatra for the Third day started from the Mayadhar. When this PadYatra spreading the Gandhian thoughts, values and basic education reached at Pingri, people of the village welcomed Shri Mansukh Mandaviya and the other PadYatris with a great procession.


    The PadYatra then proceeded from Pingri to ToLakdhwada and from Ladkhwada to Anida. When the PadYtaris reached Anida, the residents of the village welcomed the PadYatris with Torans decorated all over the village. A national award winner, author Shri Ram Mori addressed the Fifth Mahavrat Sabha on the topic “Swad-Tyag”. He said, “Taste is now not only limited to the tongue, but it is also deep-rooted into mankind. The abstinence of taste done by Bapu was his penance. Be it the taste of food or be it the taste of anger, pride or position. The taste of position itself created Mahabharat and Ramayan. Bapu preached that abstinence of taste makes your fortitude stronger.”


    The second speaker on the same topic Ms. Radha Mehta said, “After joining this PadYatra I realized that the Gandhian values and will stay stronger in today’s era because of a great leader like Mansukhbhai. Control over your taste is a key to control your mind. Physical and mental peace comes from good health.” He also added, “Being a part of the PadYatra is surely a life-changing event for me.”


    Today, the producer of TarakMethaKaOoltaChashma, Shri Asitkumar Modi and two actors from the serial viz. AtmaramBhide (MandarChandvadkar) and PatrakarPopatlal (Shyam Pathak) joined the Padyatra.
