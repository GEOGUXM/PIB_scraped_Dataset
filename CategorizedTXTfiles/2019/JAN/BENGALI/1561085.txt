                As part of Republic Day (Bharat Parv) Celebrations 2019, a Mini Marathon was conducted at Sersa Stadium Kharagpur by Air Force Station Kalaikunda on 20 January 2019 under the theme ‘Know Your Forces’. The event was flagged off by Air Commodore Saji Antony, Air Officer Commanding, Air Force Station Kalaikunda and Mr KRK Reddy, Divisional Railway Manager, Kharagpur.


                The event was aimed at enhancing awareness amongst the youth and masses about Indian Air Force. Around 800 enthusiastic participants from Air Force, Police Services, Railways, IIT and various schools and colleges in Kharagpur and nearby areas participated in the event. Participants in four age groups braved the cold weather to make the event successful. A stall for publicity was also set up to disseminate information about various methods of entry to the Indian Air Force and clarify queries if any.


                The participants commenced the run from Sersa Stadium and covered the route running through the railway campus. After the event, prizes were distributed to all winners of each category. Speaking on the occasion, the Air Officer elucidated the importance of remaining healthy for a happy life. He also emphasized on the opportunities in the Air Force as a career and the need to imbibe passion for sports and games.
