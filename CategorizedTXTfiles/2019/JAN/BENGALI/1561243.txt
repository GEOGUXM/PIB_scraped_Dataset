    The Navy along with the Coast Guard successfully conducted the Coastal Defence Exercise “Sea Vigil” in close coordination with all maritime stakeholders, including the fishing and coastal communities from 22 to 23 Jan 2019. The mega exercise, first of its kind, was undertaken along the entire 7516.6 km coastline and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of India with over 30 ships and aircrafts of Indian Navy and Coast Guard as well as 85 patrol boats manned by various security agencies participating from West Bengal, Odhisa, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. While the Marine police boats were operating up to five miles from the coast, Navy and Coast guard had deployed their assets on the high seas. Air tasks of IN/ICG assets were also undertaken to maintain high vigil.


    To evaluate the coastal security mechanism, simulated infiltration from the sea by joint teams of security agencies collectively called Red Force was attempted. These teams aimed to breach the multi-tier security barriers at sea, close to the land and in the hinterland. Hijack/ hostage situation onboard merchant vessels operating off east coast was also simulated to check effectiveness of CMG (Crisis Management Group) and Naval Commandos.


    The conduct of this exercise has been facilitated by Ministries of Defence, Home Affairs, Shipping, Petroleum & Natural Gas, Fisheries, Customs, state governments, Union Territories and other agencies of the Centre/ state.
