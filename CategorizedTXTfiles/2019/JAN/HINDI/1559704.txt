    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind has greeted fellow citizens on the eve of the festivals of Lohri, Makar Sankranti, Pongal, Bhogali Bihu, Uttarayan and Push Parbon.


    In his message the President has said, “As the sun enters Capricorn and the weather begins to change, I extend my warm greetings and best wishes to all fellow citizens in India and abroad on the occasion of Lohri, Makar Sankranti, Pongal, Bhogali Bihu, Uttarayan and Poush Parbon, to celebrate the harvesting season.


    These festivals – which are celebrated in diverse yet similar ways, across India – are an occasion to celebrate the hard work and perseverance of millions of our farmers and people across the country.
