    Mauritius Prime Minister Mr Pravind Jugnauth and Guests of 15th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas will be visiting Prayagraj Kumbh tomorrow.


    Prime Minister Mr Jugnauth will return to New Delhi after visiting Sangam and Hanuman temple and Kumbhâ€™s newly developed Integrated command, control Centre. Pravasi Bharatiya Divas guests will stay at four tent cities namely Indraprustham, Vedika, Kumbham and Agaman in sector 20 at Prayagraj Kumbh. All tent cities have been decorated nicely. Elaborate security arrangements are in place. They will also visit Sanskriti Gram and Kala gram to see the Indian artisan and crafts. They will also visit to Sangam, Akshaya Vat, Samudra Kup, Saraswati Kup and Hanuman Temple.


    All arrangements are in place at Prayagraj Kumbh to welcome the guests. DIG Kumbh KP Singh has said that elaborate security arrangements have been made in view of the PBD.


    Guests participating in the three days long functions at Varanasi will reach Prayagraj by bus in groups from Varanasi via Mirzapur under tight security. Trained policemen, translators and guides will accompany the guests during their visit to Prayagraj Kumbh. They are likely to visit important places of Prayagraj Kumbh during their stay. Authorities are hopeful that their visit will prove an effective measure to convey the message of Divya Kumbh and Bhavya Kumbh to the Indians living abroad.
