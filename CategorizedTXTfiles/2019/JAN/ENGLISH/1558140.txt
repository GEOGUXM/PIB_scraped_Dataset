Every district of the country is covered at least once in a year for recruitment. Candidates aspiring to join Army register themselves online for recruitment, after which they are called for screening at nominated recruitment venues on specified date and time. Every candidate irrespective of class/caste/community/religion is given equal opportunity in recruitment.
