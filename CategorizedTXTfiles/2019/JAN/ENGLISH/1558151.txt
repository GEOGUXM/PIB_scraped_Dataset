      Posted On: 02 JAN 2019 3:16PM by PIB Delhi


    Capital procurement of defence equipment from domestic and foreign vendors is undertaken as per the extant Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP). During the last three years and current year (upto October, 2018), 121 contracts have been signed with Indian vendors worth about Rs.73918 crore and 67 contracts have been signed with foreign vendors worth about Rs. 1,65,590 crore for capital procurement of defence equipment for Armed Forces such as Radars, Aircraft, Rockets, Artillery Guns, Helicopters, Missiles, Ballistic Helmets, Bullet Proof Jackets, Weapons, Simulators and Ammunition.


    DPP-2016 focuses on institutionalizing, streamlining and simplifying defence procurement procedure to give a boost to the “Make in India” initiative of the Government of India, by promoting indigenous design, development and manufacturing of defence equipment, platforms, systems and sub-systems. Ministry of Defence is committed to the objectives of DPP-2016 and is taking all steps necessary to realize these objectives.


    Government has also promulgated the policy of Strategic Partnership in the Defence Sector which encourages participation of the private sector in manufacture of major defence platforms and equipment in four selected segments viz. Submarines, Fighter Aircraft, Helicopters and Armoured Fighting Vehicles / Tanks.


    This information was given by Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri C. Mahendran in Lok Sabha today.
