    Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP), now called as Scheduled Tribe Component (STC) at Central level and Tribal Sub-Scheme (TSS) at State level is dedicated source of fund for tribal development across the country.Major part of infrastructure development in tribal dominated areas and provision of basic amenities to tribal people in the country including provision of medical facilities is carried out through various schemes / programmes of concerned Central Ministries and the State Governments, while the Ministry of Tribal Affairs provides additive to these initiatives by way of plugging gaps.“Public Health & hospital” being a State subject, the primary responsibility of setting up of government hospitals in the tribal areas is that of respective State/ UT governments.


    Ministry of Tribal Affairs through its schemes ‘Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS)’, Grant-in-Aid to voluntary Organisations and Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution provides funds to the State Governments as an additive based on their proposal after approval of Project Appraisal Committee in the Ministry.

    Besides, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, through the scheme ‘National Health Mission (NHM)’ wherein Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) funds have been earmarked, provides support to States for strengthening their healthcare system including for upgradation of existing and setting up new public health infrastructure based on requirements posed by the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans.
