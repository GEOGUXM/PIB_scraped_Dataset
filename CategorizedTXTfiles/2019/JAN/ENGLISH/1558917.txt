    The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has taken a number of steps including long term strategy to prevent road accidents and road accident fatalities as per details mentioned under: -


     1. The Government has approved a National Road Safety Policy. This Policy outlines various policy measures such as promoting awareness, establishing road safety information data base, encouraging safer road infrastructure including application of intelligent transport, enforcement of safety laws etc.

     2. The Government has constituted the National Road Safety Council as the apex body to take policy decisions in matters of road safety.
     3. The Ministry has constituted Group of Ministers of State Transport Ministers to examine the best practices of Transport and suggest issues to improve road safety.
     4. Based on the recommendation of Group of Minister, the Ministry introduced Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Bill 2017 covering entire gamut of road safety.
     5. The Bill contains the provision of creation of Motor Vehicle Accident Fund, implementation of Cashless Treatment Scheme during Golden Hour, setting up of a dedicated agency for road safety viz. National Road Safety and Traffic Management Board (NRSTMB), enhancement of penalty for traffic rule violations, etc. which have direct impact on road safety.
     6. The Ministry has formulated a multi-pronged strategy to address the issue of road safety based on 4 ‘E’s viz. Education, Engineering (both of roads and vehicles), Enforcement and Emergency Care.
     7. Road safety has been made an integral part of road design at planning stage.
     8. Road Safety Audit of selected stretches of National Highways has been taken up.
     9. The threshold for four laning of national highway has been reduced from 15,000 Passenger Car Units (PCUs) to 10,000 PCUs. About 52,000 Km of stretches of State Highways has been identified for conversion to national highways.
    10. Setting up of model driving training institutes in States and refresher training to drivers of Heavy Motor Vehicle in the unorganized sector.
    11. Advocacy/Publicity campaign on road safety through the electronic and print media.
    12. Tightening of safety standards for vehicles like Seat Belts, anti-lock braking system etc.
    13. High priority has been accorded to identification and rectification of black spots (accident prone spots) on national highways.
    14. Guidelines for identification and rectification of black spots, carrying out road safety audits and preparation of road safety improvement proposals on NHs and also guidelines on implementation of road safety engineering measures on state roads under Central Road Fund (CRF) have been issued.
    15. 789 black spots based on fatalities in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 calendars years have been identified. So far 189 spots have already been rectified. Rectification measures at 256 spots have been sanctioned which are in various stages of implementation. 138 spots are on State Government roads / with other agencies. The balance 206 spots would be taken separately or would be rectified as part of ongoing projects.
