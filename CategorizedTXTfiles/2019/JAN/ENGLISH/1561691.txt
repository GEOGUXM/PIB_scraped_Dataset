    Bharat Mata ki Jai!

    Bharat Mata ki Jai!


    My Cabinet colleague, the country's first woman who is in charge of the Defence Ministry, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman ji; Dr. Subhash Bhamre ji, the senior officers of the three Defence Forces of India, Director General of NCC, our guests from abroad and all of you my young friends who are a part of this great tradition of NCC.


    I am really delighted to be once again a part of the Republic Day Camp of the National Cadet Corps. Whenever I am here to converse with you, past memories come alive. The way you are living your days with zeal and discipline, I too have got the opportunity to live those moments for a while. Those days spent as a Cadet are still inspiring my resolution.


    Friends,


    This camp not only has a glorious history but also a great significance for the future. I congratulate all the cadets who are a part of this camp. My best wishes to you all. The last year when I was amidst you, I had made a request to all of you. I had made an appeal to you all for your active participation in important issues related to the country and the society.


    I am pleased that NCC cadets have associated themselves with several important steps. Your efforts on several issues like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, digital transactions, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme or issues related to environment are commendable. Your effort for creating public awareness on several such issues is indeed commendable.


    The contribution of the NCC cadets especially to the rescue operation during the Kerala floods is highly appreciable. You have applied the lessons of cooperation and dedication learnt here to rescue the people in Kerala. I believe that you will continue to fulfil your responsibilities in the same way.


    Friends,


    A couple of days back, our Republic has stepped into the 70th year. I could get a glimpse of the glow on your faces and your discipline first at Rajpath and then here. And I can feel the rhythm of the steps towards New India in those glimpses. Brimming with confidence, keeping the head high and working towards the pride of the nation, your immense energy inspires the nation. India is brimming with confidence today because of your zeal. Today the world is asserting that India is not only a nation with immense possibilities but also proving the same.


    Friends,


    Our capabilities have expanded at every level whether it's the economy or our ability to fight against the enemies. Our army has given out a clear message that we don't instigate violence but if anyone tries to provoke us then we won't leave them. We are strong advocates of peace. But we won't ever step back to protect the nation. This is the reason why in the last four and a half years many important decisions have been taken while keeping the country's safety and security as paramount.


    Friends,


    India has joined the select countries of the world that have the ability to launch nuclear attacks from land, water and air and defend her. Besides, the agreements related to fighter aircrafts, and modern cannons that were in a limbo for decades have now been executed. Missiles, tanks, ammunition and helicopters are all indigenously manufactured. I assure the young friend that in the future, every big and tough decision will be taken that is necessary for the protection of the nation. If the nation is safe and secure only then the youngsters will be able to realize their dreams.


    Friends,


    You have gathered here from various corners of the country. Many of you belong to small villages and towns. I know how hard you all work! I know about your level of dedication. I would say that this hard work makes all of us prosperous and our foundation stronger. The NCC cadets will not have to look elsewhere for the outcomes of hard work. Recently with a lot of zeal, many of your colleagues have made the nation proud on several occasions.


    Several cadets came forward for various adventurous activities like mountaineering, trekking or making remarkable performance at the sports arena. Today the world is getting to know Hima Das, the cadet of Northeast Directorate. Running through the paddy fields, today Hima Das has reached at this level. Converting adversaries into opportunities, she has made the nation proud first in Junior Athletic Championship and then in Asiad games. Whenever I meet and see such great young talents, my confidence is boosted further.


    Friends,


    Dreaming big and giving wings to the aspirations is the identity of a youth. This is his natural tendency. Dream and aspire high! Expand your efforts. The present government of India is standing with every youngster and everyone who is dreaming big. It is ready to walk with them. 'New India' will give respect and opportunity to every 'Karmayogi'. As you all are ready to join the workforce of the country, I want to assure you that your skill, self-confidence and hard work will give you results irrespective of your place of birth or whether you have any contacts or not.


    Friends,


    Meaningful efforts are needed to break this tradition and to reduce the imbalance in the society. We are continuously striving to introduce the culture of EPI, that is ‘Every Person is Important’, instead of VIP. Red beacons have been removed from vehicles. Now efforts are being made to remove it from our minds. I assure you that your dreams and aspirations will not be allowed to end because of lack of money and adverse situations.


    Friends,


    When we talk of equal opportunities, an important aspect pertaining to our daughters comes to the fore. In terms of zeal and capability, there is no difference between the boy and girl cadets sitting in front of me. Providing every type of opportunity to the daughters is the priority of our government. During the last four and a half years, several initiatives have been taken to encourage the daughters to join the work force. Besides labour, services and industrial sectors our women are strengthening even the Defence Forces. Several historic steps have been taken for the same. For the first time our daughters have become Fighter Pilots. The entire world has seen Tarini. Several major decisions have been taken to strengthen the participation of daughters in the Indian Army. Steps are being taken to recruit 20% of women in the Total Corps of Military Police.


    Friends,


    Women's strengths have also been seen at Rajpath during the last four and a half years. The last time India's first all-women SWAT team had marched past the Rajpath. Also, for the first time in the history of India, all-women contingent became a part of the parade. Moreover, the nation has also seen a daughter leading an all-male contingent for the first time. Better environment is being created to ensure that the daughters lead in every area of the society. If you look at the entire picture of the last four and a half years you will feel assured that now there is no longer discussions on women’s empowerment but action!


    Friends,


    Corruption is a major obstacle in creating equal opportunities. There shouldn't be any place for bribery, nepotism or any kind of discrimination in our system.


    Corruption cannot be a part of New India. Both I and my government's thinking and action are witnesses to the fact that nobody who is corrupt no matter how influential or powerful he is, can escape. I, with complete honesty and competence, am engaged with the process of getting rid of the middlemen, and those who try to influence the system by their power and try to snatch the right of the poorest of the poor.


    Friends,


    There is an active contribution of all the youngsters towards all the initiatives taken by the government. You have carried forward the sanitation campaign in the country by Swachh Bharat. You have supported strict decisions like demonetization to fight against corruption. You have played a crucial role in making the system honest and transparent through Digital India. That is, you have saved all the schemes from being just government schemes. I have one request. During the last three-four years several sacred places have been built in Delhi in the memory of nation's statesmen. Kindly visit these places. You will get to learn a lot! Probably some of you have already visited these places. Yet I want to tell you something about it. Recently, Kranti Mandir has been opened at the Red Fort. The Kranti Mandir is dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. If you visit that place, you will know the relationship between Azad Hind Fauj and Red Fort. Similarly, last year, National Police Memorial was also inaugurated. This monument has been built in the memory of thousands of police and security personnel who have sacrificed their lives to maintain law and order in the internal areas of the country. You can also visit the Parinirvana site of Baba Saheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar on Alipur road.


    Friends,


    This place is now the new identity of Delhi. A new statue of Sardar Patel has been built in Delhi. A digital museum has been built. You will not only find information related to history associated with many great personalities in these places but also a new energy to work for the country and the society. I am confident that with this enthusiasm New India will have a new passion and strength. In the coming month, after a long wait, a Memorial of inspiration, a War Memorial will be dedicated. The nation had been waiting for a National War Memorial for our brave soldiers. The family members of brave-hearts had been waiting for so long. This should have been done way back. But after we came to power, we took the decisions and now the work is nearing completion. A national level War Memorial of India will be almost ready by the month of February in the memory of the country's heroic people who have made supreme sacrifices and have laid down their lives. It will be inaugurated in February and we will get the opportunity to honour our soldiers. Once again my best wishes to you all. This event changes our thinking. This month-long activity takes our thinking to the national level. What do we think for our nation? It provides us a context to think of our nation instead of just our village, colony, caste or community. The progress of any nation depends on how the thread of unity is binding its people. The second basis for a nation's progress is the level of aspirations and hopes it possesses. A society in despair can never carry the nation ahead. Today I can proudly say that the 125 crore Indians are brimming with new hopes and aspirations. Therefore, I believe that my nation will achieve new heights and fulfil its dreams. The time has come to fulfil the dreams of the freedom fighters. Come, let us together hail Mother India and give new energy and strength to those dreams and take a new resolution. Say along with me -


    Bharat Mata ki Jai!


    Bharat Mata ki Jai!


    Bharat Mata ki Jai!


    Thanks a lot!!
