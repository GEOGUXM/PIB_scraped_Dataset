    Victory to Mother India!


    Governor of Odisha Professor Ganesh Lal ji, my cabinet colleagues Shri Jual Oram ji and Dharmendra Pradhan ji, the minister of the Odisha government Snehangini Chhuria ji, my colleague in the Parliament Shri Kalikesh Narayan Singh Deo ji, and my dear brothers and sisters who are present here today! I have got the opportunity to visit Odisha once again in the New Year. Coming here on the occasion of Makar Sankranti and associating with the new ray of development itself is extremely significant. My best wishes to the people of Odisha and to the nation on this auspicious occasion of festivities.


    Friends,


    The central government's work is ceaselessly going on for the development of Odisha and the entire Eastern India. This is the third time in the past one month that I am with you all. A short while ago, projects worth more than Rs.15 crores have either been inaugurated, dedicated to the nation or their foundation stones have been laid. These projects are related to education, connectivity, culture and tourism. And I am glad that the foundation stone for a permanent building of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Sonepur has also been laid. After the completion of this project, thousands of students of Sonepur as well as the entire region will benefit out of it. Thousands of students are enrolled in the Kendriya Vidyalayas of Odisha. Keeping in line with the demands of the Kendriya Vidyalayas here, the central government has taken several steps. After 2014 many new central schools have been inaugurated here and the work for some more are in the final stage.


    Friends,


    Education develops human resources. These resources turn into opportunities when there is a support of connectivity. Keeping this in mind, connectivity is being expanded in Odisha. Today 6 projects related to railways were either dedicated or inaugurated. This will not only improve the connectivity within Odisha but will also facilitate transportation across other states. This will not only help you all in smooth transportation but will also facilitate the farmer brothers to carry their produce to big Mandis and bigger cities. It will also create a better environment for the industries as it will facilitate easy transportation of freight. As the industries will start clustering around this region, it will develop better employment opportunities for the youth.


    Friends,


    Just a short while ago, a new railway line between Balangir and Bichhupali was inaugurated. Besides, a new train on this track has also been flagged off. I congratulate you all for this. And I congratulate you all for the multi-modal logistics port of Jharsuguda, for the electrification of Jharsuguda-Vizianagaram-Sambalpur-Angul line, broadening of Barpali-Dunguripali and Balangir-Deogaon lines and for the bridge constructed over Nagavali River. My best wishes to you all.


    Friends,


    Good connectivity has a positive impact on almost all sectors. It creates immense possibilities especially for the tourism sector. Odisha, in general, is an attractive tourist spot. It has both forests as well as sea beaches. It has abundant natural beauty. At the same time it has been a centre of history and devotion.


    Friends,


    With this spirit for the last four years, the central government is engaged in the work of developing the pilgrimage centres and the centers of cultural heritage. Efforts are being made to beautify and restore many temples, old forts and other places of Odisha. Under these efforts, the restoration and beautification work of Nilamadhav temple and Siddheshwar temple has been started today. Similarly, the work of renovation and beautification of the West Somnath Temple, Bhubaneswar Temple and Kapileshwar Temple has been completed and today these have also been inaugurated. Besides, the traditional trade route here connects Odisha with Central India. There are many historical monuments on that route. The Ranipur Jhariyal group of temples in Balangir is also being given a facelift. Heritage such as the 64 yogini temples, or Laharaguni, Someshwar Raniguni or Indrali temples are going to enhance the glory of our devotional and historical centres.


    Friends,


    The renovation and beautification work of another monument has begun today. Asurgarh fort of Kalahandi is not only a symbol of valour, but has also been an important political and business center. It used to connect Mahakantara to Kalinga. I feel overjoyed to be connected with these golden chapters of our history. I am confident that the basic amenities that have been developed here and the work that has been done for the devotees and tourists will spur the growth of tourism here, and the employment opportunities will also increase manifold.


    Friends,


    Here, six new Post Office Passport Seva Kendras have been opened today. Due to these new centres that have been opened up in Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara, Puri, Phulbani, Bargarh and Balangir, the people are not required to travel far off places for a passport.


    Friends,


    Once again I congratulate you all, the people of Odisha for these projects that will make your lives easier. Once again, my best wishes to you all for New Year.


    Thanks a lot!
