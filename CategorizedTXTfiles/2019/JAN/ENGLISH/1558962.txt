      Posted On: 07 JAN 2019 6:03PM by PIB Delhi


    The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is implementing a scheme namely “Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribes Groups (PVTG)” for the welfare of PVTGs. This is a demand driven scheme. The scheme is flexible as it enables the States/Union Territory(UT) to focus on areas that they consider is relevant to PVTGs and their socio-cultural environment while retaining the culture and heritage of the community by adopting habitat development approach and intervening in all spheres of their social and economic life.


    Activities under the scheme include housing, land distribution, land development, agricultural development, animal husbandry, construction of link roads, culture, installation of non-conventional sources of energy for lighting purpose, social security or any other innovative activity meant for the comprehensive socio-economic development of PVTGs.


    The proposal under Conservation-cum-Development (CCD) are submitted by State Governments/UT before the Project Appraisal Committee (PAC) in the Ministry for appraisal and approval. The activities/projects sanctioned under the scheme differ from State to State depending on demand raised by respective State Governments/UT.


    This information was given by Union Minister of State for Tribal Affairs Shri Jaswantsinh Bhabhor in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
