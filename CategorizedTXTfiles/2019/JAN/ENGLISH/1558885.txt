    Re-gasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) is imported under open general license on the terms and conditions mutually agreed upon between the buyers and sellers. Based on techno-commercial contracts, the companies procure LNG / crude from countries across the world. Indian refineries import crude oil from diverse sources depending on technical and commercial consideration. Indian Public Sector refineries are diversifying their crude sources to strengthen Indiaâ€™s energy security.


    The Government had approved a scheme for Gas Pooling in fertilizers sector on 31.03.2015. The scheme seeks to establish a mechanism for pooling the price of domestic gas and RLNG for offering a uniform gas price to all the customers in Fertilizers sector. The Government had also approved a Power Sector Development Fund (PSDF) in connection with supply of RLNG to gas based plants selected through the reverse e-bidding process. The scheme concluded on 31.03.2017.


    Domestic gas is being allocated to all sectors as per Gas Utilization Policy of the Government. The domestic gas is first allocated to the priority sector such CGD sector for PNG (Domestic) and CNG (Transport), Fertilizer, Power, LPG etc.


    Any demand over and above domestic gas (including for SME Sector) may be met through imported R-LNG which is imported under open general license on mutually agreed terms.
