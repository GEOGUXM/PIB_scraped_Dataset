      Posted On: 02 JAN 2019 3:12PM by PIB Delhi


    Building and Other Construction Workers (BOCW) welfare cess is not collected on the basis of the daily wage of a BOC worker. The BOCW (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Services) Act, 1996 provides for social security and welfare of BOCW. For the above said purposes, a cess is levied and collected at the rate of 1% of the cost of construction by the State Governments/UT Administrations under the Building and Other Construction Workersâ€™ welfare cess Act, 1996. The State Governments/UT Administrations have collected around Rs.45,473.1 crore and spent an amount of Rs.17,591.592 Crore up to 30.09.2018. The State Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Boards, constituted under BOCW Act, utilize the cess fund for the social security and welfare of BOC workers in terms of Section 22 of BOCW Act, 1996.


    This information was given by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar, Minister of State (I/C) for Labour and Employment in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
