Director General Border Roads Lt Gen Harpal Singh explained the rigours/hurdles faced by BRO in tough working conditions in an almost inhospitable terrain facing turbulent flash floods and also pointed out that the BRO has sacrificed numerous precious lives in discharging its duties across the length and breadth of country.
