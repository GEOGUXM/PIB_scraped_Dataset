The index for ‘Manufacture of Beverages’ group rose by 0.2 percent to 122.0 (provisional) from 121.7 (provisional) for the previous month due to higher price of aerated drinks/soft drinks (incl. soft drink concentrates) (1%). However, the price of bottled mineral water and beer (1% each) declined.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Basic Metals’ group declined by 1.2 percent to 112.5 (provisional) from 113.9 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of angles, channels, sections, steel (coated/not) (4%), alloy steel wire rods, sponge iron/direct reduced iron (DRI)and mild steel (MS) blooms (3% each), hot rolled (HR) coils & sheets, including narrow strip, gp/gc sheet, copper metal/copper rings, ferrochrome, aluminium disk & circles, aluminium shapes- bars/rods/flats, brass metal/sheet/coils, MS pencil ingots, MS wire rods, MS bright bars, pig iron and aluminium powder (2% each) and aluminium ingot, aluminium alloys, steel cables, cold rolled (CR) coils & sheets, including narrow strip, ferromanganese, stainless steel pencil ingots/billets/slabs, alloy steel castings, stainless steel tubes, copper shapes- bars/rods/plates/strips and aluminium castings (1% each). However, the price of steel forgings-rough, stainless steel coils, strips & sheets, ms castings and cast iron [castings] (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Fabricated Metal Products, Except Machinery and Equipment’ group declined by 0.1 percent to 116.1 (provisional) from 116.2 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of boilers (5%), steel door (3%), cylinders and copper bolts, screws, nuts (2% each) and bolts, screws, nuts & nails of iron & steel, aluminium utensils, hose pipes in set or otherwise and jigs & fixture (1% each). However, the price of forged steel rings (5%), hand tools and electrical stamping-laminated or otherwise (2% each) and pressure cooker, steel drums & barrels, iron/steel cap, steel container and stainless steel utensils (1% each) moved up.

The index for ‘Manufacture of Computer, Electronic and Optical Products’ group declined by 0.6 percent to 112.3 (provisional) from 113.0 (provisional) for the previous month due to lower price of sunglasses (4%), colour TV (3%), electronic printed circuit board (PCB)/micro circuit (2%) and meter (non-electrical) (1%). However, the price of electro-diagnostic apparatus, used in medical, surgical, dental or veterinary sciences (7%) and scientific time keeping device (1%) moved up.

However, the price of stringed musical instruments (incl. santoor, guitars, etc.) (3%) and playing cards (1%) declined.
