    Saryu Nahar Pariyojna and Gosikhurd Irrigation Project with target Culturable Command Area (CCA) of 4.80 LHa and 1.76 LHa respectively have been included under CADWM programme under PMKSY-AIBP. Works of Teesta Barrage project are at standstill due to issues related to Land Acquisition (LA) and the State has not sent any proposal for CAD works. As informed by the State Government, tenders have been called for Detailed Project Report (DPR) of CAD works for Polavaram project.
