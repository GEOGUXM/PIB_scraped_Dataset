    It was a moment of great pride when 170 students of Navy Children School, Chanakyapuri, New Delhi sparkled on Rajpath in their performance on ‘Jai Ghosh’- an acclamation of faith and assurance in the principles of non-violence, humanity and truth shown by the divine soul-Mahatma Gandhi.


    This contingent of NCS Delhi students went through a rigorous selection process first by Directorate of Education, Govt of NCT Delhi and subsequently by the Ministry of Defence. After having cleared four rounds of selection, they had practiced to perfection for the last three months before enthralling the captiveaudience on Rajpath with their scintillating dance.


    Through their performance, NCS students affirmed their faith in the legacy of principles and ideologies of the father of the nation that hold good even after 150 years.


    It was indeed a tribute to the great soul of India who was the very embodiment of simplicity, ahimsa and truth.
