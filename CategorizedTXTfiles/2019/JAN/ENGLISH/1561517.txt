These digital screens are useful both day and night. Even programs of Prime Minister Narendra Modi held in different parts of the country and programs of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath are also being telecast live on these screens. A control room has been set up at National Media Centre for this objective. Screens have been even put up in tent cities developed at sectors 19 and 20 for visitors consumption. On these screens informations, DOs and Don’ts are also being screened related to fire safety, traffic, bathing, General health and voters awareness etc. A network of Public address system with large number of loudspeakers at wooden polls has been set up.


    Similarly both national broadcasters All India Radio and Doordarshan are also engaged in spreading informations running special transmitters. AIR’s FM transmitter on Kumbh is very useful to devotees as it is available on their mobile phones. Khoya Paya, lost and found centres are linked with control room of digital screens and informations received from these centres are also available on screens. Certainly, a high tech information system and special broadcast of AIR and telecast of DD have been very useful.
