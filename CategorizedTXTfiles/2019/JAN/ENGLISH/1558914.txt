      Setting up of Indian Institute of Skills (IISs)
      Posted On: 07 JAN 2019 4:55PM by PIB Delhi


    Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship has approved the proposal to set up Indian Institute of Skills (IISs) in 3 locations viz. Kanpur, Mumbai and Ahmedabad in the country.


    The basic functional design and orientation of existing skill training institutions, which were established during 1960s, have remained substantively the same and, in particular, lack modern training infrastructure and methodology to impart skill training in collaboration with industry leaders. For this reason and to promote further growth of the Indian Skills sector overall, new measures have been initiated by the Government of India to establish state of the art training institutions called Indian Institutes of Skill (IISs) in Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Kanpur on Not-for-profit Public Private Partnership (N-PPP) basis. :


    The IISs are conceptualized with an objective to provide advanced skills in highly specialized areas – for example defence, aerospace, oil & gas and other emerging business domains to name a few – to develop highly skilled technical manpower to meet the demands of organizations that are currently operating and are likely to set up their production/manufacturing & business facilities in India. They are expected to emerge as premier training institutions in the country and make vocational training aspirational for the youth.


    Government will provide access to its land to the private partners through a licence. The licence would stipulate, inter alia, the expectations from the private partner in terms of performance outcomes such as a minimum of 5000 students passing out every year five years after commencement of operations, with campus placement of at least 70% of the trainees on a monthly median salary/income level based on the current levels of wages for comparative positions and a skill wage premium befitting a high-quality aspirational skill institution.


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Shri Anantkumar Hegde in a written reply to the Lok Sabha today.
