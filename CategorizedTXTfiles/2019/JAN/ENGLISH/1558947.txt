    Import policy of Peas (including Yellow peas, Green peas, Dun peas and Kaspa peas) was revised from ‘free to ‘restricted’ initially for a period of three months with effect from 01.04.2018 till 30.06.2018 with a quota of one lakh MT. Restriction was extended for a further period of three months till 30.09.2018. Again it was extended till 31.03.2019. These are all available in public domain in DGFT’s website: dgft.gov.in.


    Several WTO Members questioned India at the WTO Committee on Agriculture as well as in the bilateral meetings on the basis on which India imposed quantitative restrictions ( QRs) and its consistency with WTO rules. India has stated that the imposition of QR was a temporary measure undertaken to protect the small and marginal farmers from adverse impact of drop in prices. Thereafter, such measures are reviewed on a regular basis initiatives are taken to support domestic producers.


    This information was given by the Minister of State of Commerce and Industry, C. R. Chaudhary, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
