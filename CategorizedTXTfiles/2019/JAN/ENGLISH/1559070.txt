The quantities are procured by the STEs at L1 rates out of the available bids.

SCOS decides the overall quantity of urea required to be imported on Government Account and authorizes Secretary (Fertilizers) as Chairperson of SCOS to determine the timing, quantity and STE to import urea on Government Account for ensuring adequate availability of urea in the country, Shri Singh informed.
