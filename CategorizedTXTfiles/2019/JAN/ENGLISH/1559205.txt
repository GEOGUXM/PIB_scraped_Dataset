    The 15th Finance Commission had a detailed meeting with the representatives of the Trade and Industries representatives of Odisha.


    The Commission felt that it was ironic that with 72% of Indiaâ€™s mineral resources, manufacturing sector in Odisha was still very moderate. This has resulted in low job creation.


    With so much mineral wealth, Odisha is truly an example of a State which is nowhere near reaching its true growth potential.


    Some recent initiatives of the State Government have been good and effective, but deeper changes in the regulatory framework, combined with improved infrastructure and logistics are needed to make the State truly competitive.


    The Commission is of the view that the state of Odisha has a great future given political stability and other factor endowments.
