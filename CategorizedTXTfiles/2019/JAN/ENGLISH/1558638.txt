      Posted On: 04 JAN 2019 4:39PM by PIB Delhi


    The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MOHFW) has launched the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme for nutritional support to tuberculosis patients as Nikshay Poshan Yojana (NPY) from 01.04.2018.


    As on 1 st January 2019, out of 20.94 lakhs eligible beneficiaries, 8.78 lakh (42%) beneficiaries have received the benefit under the scheme.


    The Government has taken various measures to expedite the progress under the schemes such as:

      * The Ministry has provided detailed guidance to the State/Union Territories (UTs) on how DBT is to be operationalized. State/UTs have been given different payment options as per their convenience for either making payment directly through Public Financial Management System (PFMS) or through the Nikshay PFMS interface
      * Flexibility of providing the benefit through existing bank account of a blood relative has also been given. State have also been advised to facilitate opening of zero balance accounts for TB patients, if necessary, under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) and Indian Postal Bank.
      * The Ministry is regularly monitoring the implementation of this scheme and promptly addressing the challenges identified by the State/UTs.

    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
