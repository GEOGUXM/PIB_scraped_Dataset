      Withdrawal of Paramilitary Forces from LWE areas in West Bengal
      Posted On: 02 JAN 2019 3:06PM by PIB Delhi


    A dynamic approach towards deployment of forces is essential in view of evolving LWE situation. Deployment of forces in LWE affected states is reviewed on regular basis taking into consideration the ground situation, and the re-deployment of forces is affected to ensure optimum utilization of forces.


    In West Bengal, no LWE related violence incident/ death has been recorded since 2014, therefore, out of 07 battalions of CAPFs, redeployment of 03 battalions to Chhattisgarh has been ordered in August 2018.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
