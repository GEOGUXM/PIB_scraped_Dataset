    Considering the need and demand from bamboo based stakeholders and to provide cheaper bamboo products to the consumers, the Government has reduced GST on bamboo furniture & bamboo flooring to 12%. The Mission also envisages establishment of primary processing units close to the production area to reduce transportation costs and complete utilization of bamboo to move towards zero wastage so as to improve economies and lower costs to consumers.


    For popularizing use of bamboo & bamboo based products, 235 seminars, conferences, awareness campaign etc. at National, State & Districts Levels, & capacity building programmes for 15041 participants including farmers/artisans & field functionaries have been approved so far under the restructured NBM. Awareness is also created through print and electronic media and participation of NBM in fairs and other events.
