    2. Background: The first specification of Scheduled Tribes in relation to a particular State or Union territory is by a notified Order of the President, after consultation with the State Government / UT concerned. Any subsequent inclusion in or exclusion from and other modifications in the list of Scheduled Tribes can be made only through an amending Act of Parliament.


    3. Major Impact: This will fulfill the long term demand of the above communities for granting Scheduled Tribes status to them in the State of Assam. The persons belonging to the above communities will be eligible to get the Scheduled Tribe certificate from the State of Assam and will also be eligible for all benefits meant for the Scheduled Tribes in the State.
