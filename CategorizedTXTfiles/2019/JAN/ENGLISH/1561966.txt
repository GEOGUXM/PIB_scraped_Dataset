He said that initiatives like Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyaan and Mission Indradhanush played a vital role in the decline in the mortality rate.

PM also emphasized the importance of preventive health care and said the world has recognized the role of Yoga for wellness.


    PM said that Ayushman Bharat Scheme will create an entirely new ecosystem which helps to create healthier India. The scheme will boost set up of new hospitals in tier 2-3 cities, which also increases job opportunities in the healthcare sector, he added. He said that more number of generic medicines are now available for the people which will not only reduce the cost of health care but also save many precious lives.
