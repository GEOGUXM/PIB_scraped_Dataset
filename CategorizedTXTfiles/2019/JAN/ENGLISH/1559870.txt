    A group of schoolchildren on an education excursion from North Sikkim called on the Union Minister for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), Dr Jitendra Singh here yesterday.


    The tour has been sponsored by 11 th Battalion of Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) under the Civic Action Program (CAP) 2018-19. The aim of the tour is to give opportunity to students from the remote region to experience the diversity and rich cultural heritage of the vast country and witness the development taking place across the country.


    The 32-member group consists of 29 students (16 Girls and 13 Boys) and three teachers. The students belong to two schools from Lachen area of North Sikkim region and are in the 14-18 age group. They are from class VI, VII, IX and X.


    While interacting with the students, Dr. Jitendra Singh said the Union Government has taken several steps for development of the North-East Region, particularly improving the infrastructure sector. In September last year the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi inaugurated the Pakyong airport near Gangtok, Sikkim’s first and the 100 th airport in the country. He encouraged the children to participate in sports and extra-curricular activities. Dr. Jitendra Singh conveyed his best wishes to the children for success in their future endeavours.


    The 10-day excursion tour was flagged off from 11 th Battalion ITBP on January 10, 2019 and will conclude on January 19, 2019.
