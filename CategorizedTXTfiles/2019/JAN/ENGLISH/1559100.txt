      Model Police Bill
      Posted On: 08 JAN 2019 5:03PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government has reviewed the Model Police Act, 2006 and accordingly, a draft Model Police Bill, 2015 has been prepared and placed on the website of BPR&D. Further, as “Police” is a State subject, falling in List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, it is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments to formulate new Police Act or amend their existing Act on the lines of draft Model Police Bill prepared by the Central Government.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
