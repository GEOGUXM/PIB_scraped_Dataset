    Prime Minister said the country has seen a major expansion in healthcare facilities and medical education over the past four years which will be of great help in meeting the health care needs of the citizens.


    The concern for the poor and the need to address them came to the fore as PM said,” The Government stands with the poor and its priority for them is reflected in expansion of health care services and provision of generic drugs at low prices under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana. Around 5000 Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country .”

For this purpose, number of seats in educational institutions is being increased by 10%.

He added that very few municipal corporations in the country have come forward with such a world class healthcare facility. PM lauded Sardar Patel’s role as a Mayor of Ahmedabad who led by example with his drive for health, hygiene and cleanliness in the city.


    The Prime Minister summed up his address at the event with his remarks that in keeping up with its commitment towards equal opportunity for all and for the development - Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas is the way forward for New India.
