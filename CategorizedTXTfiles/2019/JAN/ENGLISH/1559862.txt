    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi will visit Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala tomorrow on January 15, 2019.


    In Kollam, Prime Minister will inaugurate Kollam bypass on NH-66. It is a 13 km long 2 lane bypass, with a project cost of Rs. 352 crore. It includes 3 major bridges over the Ashtamudi Lake, having a total length of 1540 metres. This project will reduce travel time between Alappuzha and Thiruvananthapuram, and will also decongest traffic in Kollam town.


    In Thiruvananthapuram, PM Shri Narendra Modi will visit the Padmanabhaswamy Temple . He is likely to unveil a plaque to mark the launch of some visitor facilities.


    This will be the third official visit of the Prime Minister to Kollam. His first visit to the city was in December 2015, when he unveiled the statue of R. Sankar. Subsequently, the Prime Minister visited Kollam in April 2016, hours after the fire tragedy.
