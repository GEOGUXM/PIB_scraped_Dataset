    Union Minister of State for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Chemical & Fertilizers Shri Mansukh Mandaviya has said that the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has inventorized 1,72,517 bridges/structures under Indian Bridge Management System ( IBMS). These structures comprise 1,34,229 culverts, 32,806 minor bridges, 3,647 major and 1,835 extra-long bridges. Earlier there was no proper data available on these structures on the National Highways network.


    The IBM System has been established to develop the data in digital form, to identify the number of bridges and other structures on National Highways, to carry out the condition survey and inventorization of bridges/structures and to identify the distressed bridges which need immediate attention and to sensitize the concerned implementation agency for taking corrective measures such as repair, rehabilitation reconstruction/ new construction etc.


    The Minister said, the bridges /structure condition data will be collected twice a year during ‘Pre-Monsoon’ and ‘Post-Monsoon’ period for 3 years by using Mobile Bridge Inspection Units (MBIU). Eleven consultancy firms have been appointed for this purpose. The condition survey report and recommendation submitted by consultant will be used as input for granting permission for movement of over-dimension and overweight Vehicles(ODC/OWC) consignments on National Highways which has been made online by the Ministry as well as help in future management/repair/rehabilitation of the assets.
