      Posted On: 04 JAN 2019 5:37PM by PIB Delhi


    Indian Railways (IR) is committed to provide a comfortable jerk free journey to its passengers and endeavours to achieve that with the use of better technology continuously.


    To minimize the effect of jerks and to improve riding comfort for passengers, IR has introduced new design Centre Buffer Couplers (CBC) with Balanced Draft Gear (BDG) as per specification prepared by Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO) / Lucknow.


    It has been decided to proliferate CBCs with BDG on all the Mainline passenger coaches of Indian Railways. All new Mainline passenger coaches are being manufactured with CBCs having BDG. In this direction, sanction under Rolling Stock Programme for 100% replacement of the old design CBCs with new design CBCs with BDG has also been taken. The work is under progress at Zonal Railways.


    This information was given by the Minister of State of Railways, Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
