     1. Gist of Bill: On the basis of recommendation of State of Karnataka, it is proposed to amend Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950 relating to Karnataka to grant Scheduled Tribe status to and to include the communities, namely (i) “Parivara and Talawara as Synonyms of ‘Nayaka’ at Sl. No.38 and (ii) “Siddi” community of Dharwad and Belagavi districts along with existing ‘Siddi’ community of Uttar Kannada district at Sl. No. 50, in the list of Scheduled Tribes of Karnataka.

     1. Background: The first specification of Scheduled Tribes in relation to a particular State or Union territory is by a notified Order of the President, after consultation with the State Government / UT concerned. Any subsequent inclusion in or exclusion from and other modifications in the list of Scheduled Tribes can be made only through an amending Act of Parliament.

The demand of ‘Siddi’ community of Dharwad and Belagavi districts for granting Scheduled Tribes status along with the existing ‘Siddi’ community of Uttar Kannada district will also be fulfilled. The persons belonging to “Parivara’ and ‘Talawara’ communities as well as ‘Siddi’ community of Dharwad and Belagavi districts will be eligible to get the Scheduled Tribe certificate from the State of Karnataka and will also be eligible for all benefits meant for the Scheduled Tribes in the State.
