      Exempting Pulses from Import
      Posted On: 02 JAN 2019 2:56PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government has restricted import of pulses like tur, moong and urad since August, 2017 with annual Quota Restriction of 5 lakh MT (2 lak MT for tur, 1.5 lakh MT each for urad and moong) in order to stabilise the prices and protect the interest of the farmers.


    All varieties of pulses, including organic pulses, have been made 'Free' for export without any quantitative ceiling. The export has been allowed through Customs EDI ports. However, export through the non-EDI Land Custom Stations (LCS) on Indo-Bangladesh and Indo-Nepal border has also been allowed subject to registration of quantity with DGFT. Under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) of the Foreign Trade Policy 2015-2020, Bengal Gram with HS Code 07132020 was provided rewards at the rate of 7% for exports made between 20.03.2018 to 20.09.2018


    The values of Indiaâ€™s imports of agricultural commodities including pulses, vegetable oils, wheat and apple for last four years and current year alongwith the percentage change for the current year are given below:
