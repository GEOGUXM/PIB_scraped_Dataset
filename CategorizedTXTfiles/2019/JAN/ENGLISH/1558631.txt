Key features of the portal, inter-alia include enabling borrowers to connect with multiple banks without visiting the branch, financial technology (FinTech) based architecture with high level of information security, analysis of data from various data points, loan products in line with scoring models and assessment methods within approved credit policies, prima facie eligibility check for credit guarantee from CGTMSE (Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises), etc.
