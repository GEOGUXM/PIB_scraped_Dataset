      8. The growth in real GVA during 2017-18 has been lower than that in 2016-17 mainly due to relatively lower growth in ‘agriculture, forestry & fishing’, ‘mining and quarrying’, ‘manufacturing’, ‘electricity, gas, water supply & other utility services’, ‘communication & services related to broadcasting’ and ‘real estate, ownership of dwelling & professional services’, as may be seen from Statement 4.2. During 2017-18, at constant prices, the growth rates of primary (comprising agriculture, forestry, fishing and mining & quarrying), secondary (comprising manufacturing, electricity, gas, water supply & other utility services, and construction) and tertiary (services) sectors have been estimated as 5.0 per cent, 6.0 per cent and 8.1 per cent as against a growth of 6.8 per cent, 7.5 per cent and 8.4 per cent, respectively, in the previous year.


      Net National Income


      9. Nominal Net National Income (NNI) at current prices for 2017-18 stands at Rs. 151.28 lakh crore as against Rs. 135.95 lakh crore in 2016-17, showing an increase of 11.3 per cent during 2017-18 as against an increase of 11.8 per cent in the previous year.


      Gross National Disposable Income


      10. Gross National Disposable Income (GNDI) at current prices is estimated as Rs. 173.16 lakh crore for 2017-18, while the estimate for 2016-17 stands at Rs. 155.65 lakh crore, showing a growth of 11.2 per cent in 2017-18 as against 11.0 per cent in 2016-17.


      Saving


      11. Gross Saving during 2017-18 is estimated at Rs. 52.16 lakh crore against Rs.46.48 lakh crore during 2016-17. Rate of Gross Saving to GNDI for 2017-18 is estimated at 30.1 per cent against 29.9 per cent for 2016-17.


      12. The highest contributor to Gross Saving is the household sector with saving of Rs. 29.38 lakh crore in 2017-18. The saving of non-financial corporations has increased from Rs. 18.10 lakh crore in 2016-17 to Rs. 20.73 lakh crore in 2017-18. Further, the saving of the financial corporations has also increased from Rs. 3.37 lakh crore during 2016-17 to Rs. 3.68 lakh crore in 2017-18. The saving of General Government was (-) Rs. 1.21 lakh crore during 2016-17 and (-) Rs. 1.63 lakh crore in 2017-18.


      Capital Formation


      13. Gross Capital Formation (GCF) at the current as well as the constant prices is estimated by two approaches :– (i) through flow of funds, derived as Gross Saving plus net capital inflow from Rest of the World (ROW); and (ii) by the commodity flow approach, derived by the type of assets. The estimates of GCF through the flow of funds approach are treated as the firmer estimates. GCF by industry of use and by institutional sectors does not include ‘valuables’ and therefore, these estimates are lower than the estimates available from commodity flow approach.


      14. GCF at current prices is estimated at Rs. 55.27 lakh crore for 2017-18 compared to Rs. 47.41 lakh crore during 2016-17. The rate of GCF to GDP increased from 30.9 per cent during 2016-17 to 32.3 per cent in the 2017-18. The rate of GCF (excluding valuables) to GDP stands at 29.8 per cent and 31.1 per cent for 2016-17 and 2017-18 respectively. The rate of capital formation in 2011-12 to 2017-18 has been higher than the rate of saving because of positive net capital inflow from ROW.


      15. In terms of the share to the total GCF (at current prices), the highest contributor is Non-Financial Corporations. However, its share has declined from 50.6 percent in 2016-17 to 49.5 percent in 2017-18 (Statement 9). Share of household sector in GCF has declined from 35.9 percent in 2016-17 to 34.9 percent in 2017-18. The share of General Government in GCF has increased from 12.9 per cent in 2016-17 to 13.3 per cent in 2017-18.


      16. Within the GCF at current prices, the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) amounted to Rs. 48.97 lakh crore in 2017-18 against Rs. 43.35 lakh crore in 2016-17. The rate of GFCF to GDP at current prices has increased from 28.2 per cent in 2016-17 to 28.6 per cent in 2017-18. The change in stocks of inventories, at current prices, increased from Rs. 1.40 lakh crore in 2016-17 to Rs. 1.74 lakh crore in 2017-18, while the valuables increased from Rs. 1.67 lakh crore in 2016-17 to Rs. 2.19 lakh crore in 2017-18.


      17. The rate of GCF to GDP at constant (2011-12) prices has increased from 33.7 per cent in 2016-17 to 35.5 per cent in 2017-18.


      Consumption Expenditure


      18. Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) at current prices is estimated at Rs. 100.83 lakh crore for 2017-18 as against Rs. 91.16 lakh crore in 2016-17. In relation to GDP, the rates of PFCE at current prices during 2016-17and 2017-18 are estimated at 59.3 per cent and 59.0 per cent respectively.


      19. At constant (2011-12) prices, the PFCE is estimated as Rs. 69.04 lakh crore and Rs. 74.17 lakh crore, respectively for 2016-17 and 2017-18. The corresponding rates of PFCE to GDP for 2016-17 and 2017-18 are 56.1 per cent and 56.3 per cent respectively.


      20. Government Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE) at current prices is estimated as Rs. 18.86 lakh crore for 2017-18 as against Rs. 15.83 lakh crore during 2016-17. At constant (2011-12) prices, the estimates of GFCE for 2016-17 and 2017-18 stand at Rs. 11.99 lakh crore and Rs. 13.79 lakh crore respectively.


      Estimates at per Capita Level


      21. Per Capita Income, i.e. Per Capita Net National Income at current prices, is estimated as Rs. 1,04,659 and Rs. 1,14,958 for 2016-17 and 2017-18 respectively. Correspondingly, Per Capita PFCE at current prices, for 2016-17 and 2017-18 is estimated at Rs. 70,175 and Rs. 76,619 respectively.


      22. More details of these estimates are available in Statements 1-9, appended to this Press Note.


      Summary of Revision in the GDP Estimates


      23. The use of latest available data from various agencies has resulted in some changes in both the levels of GVA and growth estimates for 2015-16 and 2016-17. The reasons for revision in the estimates of 2015-16 and 2016-17, released on 31.05.2018 are summarized in the Annexure.

      FORMULAE

       1. GVA at basic prices = CE + OS/MI + CFC + Production taxes (i) less Production subsidies (ii)
       2. GDP = ∑ GVA at basic prices + Product taxes - Product subsidies
       3. NDP/NNI = GDP/GNI - CFC
       4. GNI = GDP + Net primary income from ROW (Receipts less payments)
       5. Primary Incomes = CE + Property and Entrepreneurial Income
       6. NNDI =NNI + other current transfers from ROW, net (Receipts less payments)
       7. GNDI = NNDI + CFC = GNI + other current transfers (iii) from ROW, net (Receipts less payments)
       8. Gross Capital Formation (iv) = Gross Saving+ Net Capital Inflow from ROW
       9. GCF = GFCF + CIS + Valuables + “Errors and Omissions”
      10. Gross Disposable Income of Govt. = GFCE + Gross Saving of General Government
      11. Gross Disposable Income (GDI) of Households = GNDI – GDI of Govt. – Gross Saving of all Corporations

      REMARKS ON THE FORMULAE:

       1. Production taxes or subsidies are paid or received with relation to production and are independent of the volume of actual production. Some examples are:

      Production Taxes - Land Revenues, Stamps and Registration fees etc.


      Production Subsidies - Subsidies to Railways, Subsidies to village and small industries

       1. Product taxes or subsidies are paid or received on per unit of product. Some examples are:

      Product Taxes: Excise Tax, Sales tax, Service Tax and Import and Export duties


      Product Subsidies: Food, Petroleum and fertilizer subsidies

       1. Other Current Transfers refers to current transfers other than the primary incomes
       2. Estimate of GCF derived from the formula is taken as the “firmer” estimate and the difference between this estimate and the sum of GFCF, CIS and valuables is taken as “errors and omissions”, as referred in 9 above.
