      Posted On: 07 JAN 2019 5:08PM by PIB Delhi


    An Adarsh Gram evolves out of people’s shared vision, using their capacities and available resources to the best extent possible, duly facilitated by the Hon’ble Member of Parliament, the Gram Panchayat, civil society and the government machinery. The elements of an Adarsh Gram are context specific. The Gram Panchayats adopted under SAGY prepare Village Development Plans (VDP) through a participatory process under the guidance of Hon’ble Members of Parliament. The VDP includes prioritised time-bound activities to achieve holistic progress of the village. The progress of implementation of the VDPs in the SAGY Gram Panchayats as reported is satisfactory. As per data updated by the States/UTs on the SAGY website till 2nd January 2018, VDPs have been prepared by 1,155 Gram Panchayats containing 63,586 projects, out of which 32,682 (51%) projects are completed. The State-wise number of Gram Panchayats adopted under SAGY and progress of VDPs are given in Annexure.


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Rural Development, Shri Ram Kripal Yadav in Rajya Sabha today.
