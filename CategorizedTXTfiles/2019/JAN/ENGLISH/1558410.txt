      NOC for Ground Water Extraction
      Posted On: 03 JAN 2019 3:10PM by PIB Delhi


    Central Ground Water Authority has notified revised guidelines to regulate and control ground water extraction in India, which will be effective from 01.06.2019. The entire process of grant of NOC will be done online through a web based application system.


    As per the revised guidelines, Water Conservation Fee (WCF) would be levied for use of ground water depending on the category of area, type of industry and quantum of ground water withdrawal. The details in this connection are given at Annexure â€“ I.


    Central Ground Water Board along with State Ground Water Organizations carry out periodic assessment of ground water resources. The assessment units viz. Blocks/ Talukas/ Mandals etc. are categorized as safe, semi critical, critical and over exploited depending on the stage of ground water development and significant decline of ground water levels. State/UT wise categorisation of Blocks/ Talukas/ Mandals (as on 2013) is given at Annexure - II .
