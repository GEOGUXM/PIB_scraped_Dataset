      Posted On: 07 JAN 2019 5:55PM by PIB Delhi


    Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR), erstwhile DGAD, had conducted investigations on subsidies on Chinese goods and imposed countervailing/anti-subsidy duty on the following products imported from China as per the provisions under Customs Tariff Act 1975 and the Customs Tariff (Identification, Assessment, and Collection of Countervailing Duty on Subsidized Articles and for Determination of Injury) Rules, 1995:

    The Government is aware of the findings of the 145 th parliamentary committee report from Rajya Sabha which came out on 25 th July 2018 wherein it was identified that the imports of the Chinese steel have increased by 8 per cent .


    DGTR has imposed anti-dumping duty in the range of USD 44.89 to USD 185.51 per MT on straight length bars and rods of alloy steel imported from China. The anti-dumping duty is valid till 17.10.2023. Ministry of Steel has also issued the Quality Control Orders for 53 products to prevent sub-standard steel imports from China and other nations and is closely monitoring the impact of cheap steel imported from China on the domestic industry.


    This information was given by the Minister of State of Commerce and Industry, C. R. Chaudhary, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
