    No separate data is maintained on sexual assaults in the shelter homes.


    The Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is undertaking a training course for Investigation Officers and Prosecution Officers on collection, storage and transportation of forensic evidence in sexual assault cases, including use of Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit (SAECK). BPR&D is providing 100 SAECK to each State/UT as part of training for orientation.


    As per List-II in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects and the States are competent to equip their police stations suitably.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
