      Observations of 5 th State Finance Commission:


      ❖5th SFC observed that although the staff of the municipalities was given the required training, most of the municipalities were not able to provide reliable data primarily due to scarcity of staff. A large number of them had to get the services of staff of other municipalities for getting their data compiled, which resulted in poor quality of data being made available to the Commission.
