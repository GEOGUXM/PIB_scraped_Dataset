      The Defence India Startup Challenge
      Posted On: 07 JAN 2019 4:26PM by PIB Delhi


    Applications from over 500 competitors have been received and the evaluation of the applications is in process.


    The broad criteria for screening / selection from amongst competitors would be as follows:

      * Potential for proposed prototype to meet existing Indian defence needs;
      * Potential to deploy an existing technology or patent to meet existing Indian defence needs;
      * An additional but optional parameter would be whether the proposed prototype / product / technology has the ability to reach alternative civilian markets also.

    This information was given by Raksha Rajya Mantri Dr. Subhash Bhamre in a written reply to Shri Sanjay Raut in Rajya Sabha today.
