      Consumer Movement
      Posted On: 08 JAN 2019 4:34PM by PIB Delhi


    Enactment of Consumer Protection Act, 1986 has set in motion a veritable consumer movement in the country. Under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, a three tier quasi-judiciary machinery has been set up at District, State and Central levels for better protection of the interests of consumers and to provide simple and speedy redressal of consumer disputes. The consumer fora are empowered to give relief of a specific nature and award, wherever appropriate, compensation to consumers.


    A countrywide multimedia “Consumer Awareness” campaign titled ‘Jago Grahak Jago” is being conducted on various issues related to consumer rights and responsibilities across diverse subjects. The States/UT have been actively associated in the programme especially in expanding the geographic reach of the campaign on consumer awareness.


    The Department also operates the Consumer Welfare Fund to strengthen the Consumer Movement in the country by way of financial assistance to the State/UTs, VCOs/NGOs to raise awareness amongst consumers and as also to educational institutes for research on consumer issues and running of centres on consumer studies.


    The details of the funds allocated during the last three years under ‘Strengthening Consumer Fora', and ‘Consumer Awareness’ campaign are given State/UT wise at Annexure A.


    The details of funds released under the Consumer Welfare Fund to the agencies/NGOs/VCOs involved in the consumer movement are given at Annexure B .


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution , Shri C.R. Chaudhary in Lok Sabha today.
