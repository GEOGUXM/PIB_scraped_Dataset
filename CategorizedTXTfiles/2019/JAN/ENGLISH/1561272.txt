    Background


    Jharkhand had been captured multiple times on celluloid by great filmmakers including Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak when it was part of Bihar. But after attaining statehood, this scenic landscape seems to have slightly gone off the movie location map for some time. The State is making efforts to capture back its lost glory in the arena of cinema making. Since the Jharkhand State Film Policy released in 2015, the State has been steadily moving ahead in creating awareness among film-makers about its potential for film-making.


    Jharkhand was chosen as the State in Focus at IFFI 2018. Six films either shot in Jharkhand under the Jharkhand Government Film Promotion Programme, or made in the language/dialect of the state were screened during IFFI 2018. The scenic state bestowed with rugged hills, dense forests and mesmerizing waterfalls got a much-needed impetus as a film shooting destination through this initiative.
