      Posted On: 08 JAN 2019 4:30PM by PIB Delhi


    Government is aware that the International Bureau of Weights and Measures overhauled the definition of a kilogram as well as all the other basic units of measurement based on physical constants. The Government has examined these changes and supported the proposal for change in definitions of these units.


    The previous definition of kilogram was based on the mass of the international prototype ‘kilogram’ which is an artefact, however, the new definition is based on physical constant of nature. The change in the definition of kilogram will not have any implication on agriculture as well as foodgrain production in the country,


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri C.R. Chaudhary in Lok Sabha today.
