      Posted On: 08 JAN 2019 5:14PM by PIB Delhi


    At present, there is no proposal to repeal the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), 1958.


    Presently, AFSPA, 1958 is operational in entire States of Assam, Nagaland, Manipur (except Imphal Municipal area), three districts namely Tirap, Changlang and Longding of Arunachal Pradesh and the areas falling within the jurisdiction of the eight police stations in the districts of Arunachal Pradesh, bordering the State of Assam. The notification declaring Manipur and Assam as “Disturbed Areas’ have been issued by the State Governments. State Government of Nagaland has not supported extension of notification declaring Nagaland as ‘Disturbed Area’ under AFSPA, 1958.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
