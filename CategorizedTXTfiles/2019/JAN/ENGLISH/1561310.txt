    Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari will lay the foundation stone for the development of a six-lane, access controlled corridor from Akshardham in East Delhi to the Eastern Peripheral Expressway junction on Baghpat Road on the 26 th of January . The function will be held at Marginal Bund Road, Khajuri Khas, Delhi.


    The 31.3 km road stretch is part of NH-709B that will run from Akshardham to Saharanpur Bypass. The alignment of the road will be from Akshardham - Geeta Colony – Shastri Park – Khazuri Khas-Delhi/UP border-Mandola-EPE Intersection. It will be developed in two packages – first a 14.75 km stretch from Akshardham to Delhi/UP border and the other 16.57 km stretch from Delhi/UP border to EPE Intersection. There will be a 19 km elevated section . The estimated cost of the project is Rs2820 crore. The project includes construction of 3+3 lane service roads on either side of the highway, eight new underpasses, seven ramps connecting major roads, 15 major junctions, 34 minor junctions, and over-bridges at Delhi-Shahdara, New Delhi-Anand Vihar railway lines and Dilshad Garden-ISBT Metro Line. The high-speed signal-free corridor is expected to contribute to decongestion and considerable reduction in pollution levels in Delhi NCR.


    Shri Gadkriji will be accompanied by the MoS Shri Mansukh Mandaviya, MoS Dr Satya Pal Singh and Union Minister of State for External Affairs Gen V K Singh for the event.
