    The NRC 1951 in Assam is being updated under the provisions of Citizenship Act, 1955 and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003. The applications for preparation of NRC in Assam were invited in May-August, 2015 and after necessary scrutiny and verification, the complete draft NRC has been published on 30.07.2018. The claims & objections on the draft NRC have been invited until 31.12.2018. After the disposal of claims & objections, the NRC is to be finalised as per the time lines approved by the Supreme Court of India.


    The exercise to update NRC 1951 is being conducted under the Special provisions in respect of State of Assam under the Citizenship Rules, 2003. At present, there is no proposal to extend the National Register of Citizens to States other than Assam.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
