      Payment delays in MGNREGA
      Posted On: 07 JAN 2019 5:10PM by PIB Delhi


    As per Management Information System (MIS), State/UT-wise percentage of timely generation of pay order under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) since FY 2014-15 to FY 2017-18 is at Annexure-I. The Ministry along with the States/UTs has been making concerted efforts for improving the timely payment of wages. States/UTs have been advised to generate pay orders in time. This has resulted in considerable improvement in the status of timely generation of pay order and leading to improvement in actual time taken to credit wages in the workers account. The delay in payment of wages are due to implementation issues in the States which include inadequate staffing, non-timely recording and reporting of attendance, measurement, data entry, generation of wage list, Fund Transfer Order (FTO), etc.


    As per provisions under Para 29 of Schedule-II of Gandhi National NREGA, 2005 the compensation for delay in payment of wages is paid to the workers. As per Management Information System (MIS), State/UT-wise details of delay compensation paid by State Governments during current financial year 2018-19 (as on 02.01.2019) is given at Annexure-II.


    Wage rates for workers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), 2005 are notified and revised annually based on Consumer Price Index-Agricultural Labourers (CPI-AL) by the Central Government in accordance with the provisions of Section 6(1) of the Mahatma Gandhi NREGA. The revised wage rates are made applicable from 1st April of the year. The CPI-(AL) is published by Labour Bureau, Shimla. For the FY 2018-19, the wage rate has been revised w.e.f. 01.04.2018 based on CPI-(AL).


    This information was given by the Minister of State for Rural Development, Shri Ram Kripal Yadav in Rajya Sabha today.
