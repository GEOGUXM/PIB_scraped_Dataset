    The 15 km Balangir-Bichupali New Railway Line would connect coastal Odisha with western Odisha synchronising development across the State. It will reduce travel time from Bhubaneswar and Puri to major cities like New Delhi and Mumbai. The line would benefit many MSME and cottage industries in Odisha and open up opportunities for the mining sector in Odisha.
