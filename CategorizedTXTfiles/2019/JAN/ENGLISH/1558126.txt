      Posted On: 02 JAN 2019 3:10PM by PIB Delhi


    As per available information, there is no specific input about any terrorist group planning a 26/11 type attack in the Port, Cargo and oil tankers in the high seas. However, available inputs indicate that the Pakistan-based terrorist groups continue to train their cadres for underwater strike capabilities in a bid to infiltrate them into India by sea/water ways.


    Country is equipped better to face any such eventuality.


    As per available inputs, the Pakistan based terrorist organisation had exhorted its cadres for ‘Samundari Jihad’ against India.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha today.
