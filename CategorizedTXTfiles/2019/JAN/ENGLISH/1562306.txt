      Posted On: 30 JAN 2019 9:00PM by PIB Delhi


    My dear brothers and sisters!


    First of all, I offer my homage to Respected Bapu from this sacred land of Dandi that had been a witness to the freedom movement and the Satyagraha. I also pay my homage to Sardar Patel who had organized the Dandi March and was with Bapu at every step. Today, on the death anniversary of Bapu, all of us will be witnesses to an important occasion. Today, we all are lucky that the work on the National Salt Satyagraha Memorial has been completed. This Memorial is being dedicated to the nation in the year we are celebrating the150th Birth Anniversary of Pujya Bapu.


    Friends,


    Let our future generations keep prospering with the heritage that Bapu has offered to the country and the world. Today the National Salt Satyagraha Memorial of Dandi has also been associated with the same episode. Today, on the inauguration of this Memorial, I congratulate everyone, all the artisans and workers associated with its construction along with the countrymen.


    Friends,


    A short while ago, I got the opportunity to see this Memorial extensively. Gandhiji’s two palms are at the height of 40 feet and a two-and-a-half tonne white glowing rhinestone on his palms are symbols of salt. Below the palms is a 15-feet high statue of Gandhiji. It reflects the spiritual power of Gandhiji. Moreover, the statues of more than 80 satyagrahis are to remind us that in the country's freedom struggle, crores of people from various corners of the country have had the tenacity and had put their sweat and blood for the cause.


    Friends,


    A lot had been said, read and written about the Dandi March. The same has been exhibited in detail in the Museum through words and photos. Bapu's affinity towards Swadeshi, Swachhagraha or Satyagraha; I believe that this Memorial will become an important pilgrimage centre in the future. Dandi and Gujarat will get a boost from this monument in terms of tourism. The lake which has been built here is very attractive. Besides, the facility of manufacturing salt is also available here, so that the tourists can enjoy and re-live that historic moment. Dandi Heritage Path has been constructed at a cost of around Rs. 80 crores, which includes new roads and accommodation facilities.


    Brothers and sisters,


    It is essential to keep in mind the impact of the Dandi March on India's freedom movement and how the mindset of the world changed with this March. It was the Salt Satyagraha that had provided a new direction to the freedom struggle.


    During the Dandi March, the Western media had played a major role in changing the understanding towards India and our freedom movement. Prior to this historic event, most of the world watched us through the prism of Britain. But when the famous American magazine ‘Time’ chose Bapu to be the Person of the Year in the year 1930, the voice against tyranny in the world started getting new recognition.


    Friends,


    The most crucial message that Gandhi ji had attempted to give out through the Dandi March was that of creativity. Gandhi ji knew very well that the protests alone would not help us in making freedom movement successful. Therefore, he had told his colleagues that rebuilding of India would not be possible without a creative vision. Gandhiji also showed the path of uniting the common man against discrimination along with the path of civil disobedience and Khadi.


    Friends,


    When Gandhi ji had chosen salt for Satyagraha, at that time some leaders had doubted his methods. Some had even openly opposed this. But Gandhi was Gandhi. He continued with his campaign because he knew the value of salt and he recognized the relationship of salt with every class. Making salt costlier is like snatching away one morsel of meal from the poor. But the then British government had failed to understand the power of salt. The then Census General also termed this Salt Satyagraha - the attempt of creating trouble for the government with a pinch of salt - as a madness.


    Friends,


    Talking about the kind of atmosphere created by the Salt Satyagraha, the Time Magazine quoted a British journalist that two governments were operating in Bombay - on one side the British government, that had an entire administration with them, while on the other hand, the ordinary people of Bombay who were standing with one of the innumerable prisoners - Mahatma Gandhi.


    Due to the Salt Satyagraha the spirit of Swadeshi and Civil Disobedience was strengthened so much so that the British government suffered huge losses. The businessmen had to keep their shops closed for several months. Imports from the UK were reduced and the British government was shaken. The freedom fighters could clearly visualize the target of Swaraj.


    Friends,


    Just imagine! If Mahatma Gandhi had given in to the opposition by a few leaders against Salt Satyagraha; if he had changed his mind; if he had not proceeded with his March; if he had become a victim of negativity, then what would have happened?


    Friends,


    There were people back then who were opposing the move belittling the power of salt. Such a mentality existed since then. Such a mentality still exists within the country. It seems that unfortunately today more self-interest has been attached to it. I want to remind you all the type of questions that were raised during the last four - four and a half years. Think about their dialogues! Can a change be brought by constructing toilets? Is cleanliness and sanitation the job of a Prime Minister? Do lives change with gas connections? Can a poor become rich by opening bank accounts? The nation will not forget these dialogues. These are the same people. There are several such questions that were raised for personal gains. These people walk with negativity. It is pertinent to tell these people filled with negativity that a positive change occurs only when small changes are made.


    Several aspects like salt, charkha, Khadi and sanitation had empowered our freedom movement, had united the people and had made them freedom fighters. A few people at that time had belittled the Salt Satyagraha. They could not see its significance. Now they are finding a lot of work of the current government as insignificant.


    I will give you one example. Just imagine friends; because of the construction of more than nine crore toilets in the country, lakhs of people today have been saved from diseases. These toilets have made the lives of the women easier. People full of negativity cannot understand this. Their minds have been shut off with negativity. According to an estimate, the lives of 3 lakh poor people could be saved due to the construction of toilets. Those opposing Swachh Bharat and making fun of it do not care about the lives of the poor.


    Friends,


    Let them make a mockery out of it. But the New India is determined to bring these changes. Respected Bapu had said that if he had to choose between freedom and cleanliness, he would choose cleanliness first. Had these people who engage in politics in the name of Bapu, fulfilled this small dream of Bapu; had they worked towards sanitation; that would have been a real homage to Bapu.


    When the society progresses with positivity, then it can accomplish greater resolutions. On October 2 this year, when we are going to celebrate the 150 th birth anniversary of Bapu, the entire country is to be free from open defecation. I am happy that the scope of rural sanitation which was about 38 per cent in 2014 before we came to power, became 98 per cent today i.e. from thirty eight to ninety eight! This means that the country is very close to the target. Once every family in the country has toilets, then the hygiene campaign will gain more momentum.


    Friends,


    The government is relentlessly trying to ensure that the country and the world keep on seeking inspiration from Bapu's life and his lessons. You must have seen this year's Republic Day Parade on 26 th January. For the first time, the entire programme was dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi. Last year our government, our foreign department had taken an innovative step. Singers from more than 100 nations had recorded Gandhiji's favourite song - 'Vaishnava Jana to tene kahiye'. The artists from 100 nations who didn't know India's language, Gujarat's language, or who Narsi Mehta was, or the meaning of Vaishnava Jana but they could establish a heart-to-heart connection and sang this song. There are no similarities between our and their languages but they tried to grasp the song, our bhajan and its words and feelings. This is what connects Bapu with the entire world. And today I have said that these photos in Dandi will be linked to a digital system to show that these world artists have sung Vaishnava Jana. I have asked to make arrangements so that everybody can have access to this song. It will be done soon.


    Friends,


    Bapu had taken interest in Khadi and charkha but after independence people had almost forgotten about Khadi. The tradition of wearing Khadi caps to some political event or wearing long kurtas had also become limited. Khadi had almost vanished from the lives of the common man. As a result of our government's efforts, the situation has completely changed. Today the demand for Khadi jackets and other products is rising around the world. Today Khadi is not only a fashion statement in the country but also a powerful medium of women’s empowerment and telling the story of freedom.


    Friends,


    This change was not automatic. In the last four and a half years, we have modernized about 2000 institutions connected with Khadi and we have never seen which party these 2000 are connected with. We had Gandhi in our hearts, Khadi in our hearts. We had the poor weavers in our hearts. Therefore, we modernized these 2000 institutions. This has benefitted about 5 lakh people directly associated with Khadi. Now the money is directly being transferred to the workers. In the last four years, increase in the Khadi sale by two and a half times to three times, is now benefitting these artisans.


    Brothers and Sisters,


    I believe that like Swadwshi was a weapon during the freedom movement, today handloom is also an important weapon to fight poverty. Our government, considering the importance of handlooms has declared August 7 as the National Handloom Day.


    Friends,


    Overall, the village economy and cottage industry have been an important part of Gandhiji's economic thinking. This kind of thinking has been worked out in a big way in the last four and a half years. The result of the efforts of the government has been that the sale from the village enterprises which was 30 thousand crores till four years ago has more than doubled today. This has created many employment opportunities in the villages. The Government is trying to ensure 'Bharat Uday' from 'Gramoday'. It is trying to boost this mission further. The government is implementing the Gram Swaraj campaign to ensure basic amenities in the villages of the country. We are reviewing each and every village and are insisting that every house in the village has electricity, gas connection, toilets; every person living in the village has a bank account and every child gets the benefits of vaccination campaigns.


    Friends,


    We have also associated Bapu's ideals with modernity. Mission Solar Charkha is being implemented for the youth in the villages to create employment opportunities. Under this, 50 solar charkha clusters will be set up on a pilot basis in the country by next year. This will provide employment to about one lakh youth.


    You must have seen here that solar trees have been made. The power needs here will be fulfilled with solar energy. It will be consistent with Gandhi ji's ideas. The concept of this solar tree will gradually develop within every garden. People will accept it. Today, the initiative has been started from Dandi.


    Brothers and sisters,


    We are also connecting the Charkha with this solar energy so that even the elderly people can earn their living by moving the Charkha sitting at home.


    Besides Khadi, we are trying to boost the rural economy through beekeeping.


    Beekeeping in the country is being encouraged by the Honey Mission launched two years ago. The result is that, record quantity of honey is being produced in the country today. The farmers are getting additional income.


    Friends,

     1. such efforts are not only helping the nation to seek inspiration from our nation's glorious past and our heroes but also proving to be a source of livelihood for the youth. I realize that those who are used to opposing will not stop spreading their negativity. In fact such memorials like the Sardar Patel's Statue of Unity, the Kranti Mandir at the Red Fort in the memory of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, the Panchteerth spread around the country and the world in the memory of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar; the new museums being set up throughout the country for our tribal heroes; the Police Memorial in Delhi or the National War Memorial being set up for the first time since independence for the brave soldiers of India that the country will dedicate to our Army in the month of February; which have been set up in the last four and a half years are proving to be important places of heritage and tourism besides being a medium of introducing history. In the coming times, many such projects are going to strengthen heritage development and heritage tourism in India.

    Friends,


    Lakhs of job opportunities have been opened up for the youth in the last four and a half years due to just tourism. These sectors are going to expand in the future. As modern projects involving roadways, railways and airways are getting ready; India is emerging as a major tourist destination.


    Our campaign of remembering the contribution of our national heroes, enriching our culture, our history, our heritage and connecting the youth with new opportunities will continue. Dandi is not a new place for me, I have come here before. And today when I have come to Dandi, I am really grateful that you have come to bless me in such large numbers.


    Bharat Mata ki Jai!


    Bharat Mata ki Jai!


    Bharat Mata ki Jai!


    Thanks a lot!
