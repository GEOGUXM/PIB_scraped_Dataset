      Posted On: 04 JAN 2019 5:33PM by PIB Delhi


    Government has recently approved Railwaysâ€™ proposal for redevelopment of railway stations by Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Limited (IRSDC) as Nodal Agency, through simplified procedures and for longer lease tenure. Accordingly, all the stations on Indian Railways have been entrusted to IRSDC for undertaking the techno-economic feasibility studies. Based on the outcome of the feasibility studies, the stations are planned to be taken up for redevelopment, in phases.


    An agreement has been signed with the French Railway (SNCF) for joint study on Renovation Concept Design of Ambala and Ludhiana stations. Korean Railway has expressed interest in the redevelopment of New Delhi Station. Redevelopment of stations is planned through leveraging commercial development of vacant land and air space in and around railway stations, i.e. station redevelopment projects shall generally be cost neutral to Railways.


    This information was given by the Minister of State of Railways, Shri Rajen Gohain in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
