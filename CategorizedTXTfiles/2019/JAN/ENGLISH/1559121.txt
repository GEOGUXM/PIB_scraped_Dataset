      Posted On: 08 JAN 2019 5:15PM by PIB Delhi


    ‘Public Order’ and ‘Police’ are State subjects as per the Constitution of India. Therefore, equipping of police forces is the primary responsibility of the State Governments. However, the States have not been able to modernize and equip their police forces up to the desired level due to financial constraints. It is in this context that the Ministry of Home Affairs has been supplementing the efforts of the State Governments for equipping and modernizing their police forces under the scheme of ‘Assistance to States for Modernisation of Police’ [erstwhile scheme of Modernisation of Police Forces (MPF)]. Under this scheme, the States have been providing central assistance for acquisition of latest weaponry, training gadgets, advanced communication and forensic equipment etc. Jammu & Kashmir, insurgency affected North Eastern States and Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected districts have also been provided assistance for purchase of operational vehicles and for construction of police building, etc.


    The Crime and Criminal Network and Systems (CCTNS) has been rolled out nationally and as on 30.11.2018, it has been deployed in 14,764 police stations out of 15,705 police stations in the country. As on 30.11.2018, 14,724 police stations are entering all (100%) FIRs on the CCTNS software. 2.25 crore FIRs have been registered on CCTNS and 3.9 crore legacy records have been digitized (as on 30.11.2018). 12,153 police stations have been provided national level search on Crime and Criminal Data of CCTNS through Digital Police Portal.


    The Government of India assists States and UT administrations in combating cyber-crimes by providing financial grants under various schemes and issuing advisories. Ministry of Home Affairs has also approved a scheme titled ‘Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) on 5.10.2018 at an estimated cost of Rs. 415.86 crore to deal with all types of cybercrime in a comprehensive and coordinated manner. Ministry of Home Affairs has issued advisories dated 12.02.2018 and 13.01.2018 related to cyber-crime prevention and control.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
