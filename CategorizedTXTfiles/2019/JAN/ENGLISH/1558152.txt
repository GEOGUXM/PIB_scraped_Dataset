      Posted On: 02 JAN 2019 3:16PM by PIB Delhi


    Performance Related Incentive Scheme (PRIS), has not been recommended in 7th Central Pay Commission for Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).


    Government has always incentivized DRDO scientists to motivate them and boost their morale. The present incentive scheme for DRDO scientists are as follows:


    Financial Incentives:


    Up to maximum of six increments are granted to deserving Scientists at the time of promotion under Flexible Complementing Scheme (FCS) depending upon merit. Recently, the value of this variable increments has been revised, applying the fitment factor, as suggested by 7th Central Pay Commission for Basic Pay.


    Growth related Incentives:


    To give better growth and promotional avenues to the Scientists in DRDO, Merit based FCS is in place, where promotions are based on assessment and not on available vacancies.


    Further, incentivizing is a regular phenomenon on need basis.


    This information was given by Raksha Mantri Smt Nirmala Sitharaman in a written reply to Dr. P.K. Biju in Lok Sabha today.
