    Mr. Modi said that International Institutions like the World Bank, IMF and Moody’s have shown confidence on India’s economy and the reforms taken in recent times. He added, “ We have also made Doing Business cheaper. The implementation of GST and other measures of simplification of taxes have reduced transaction costs and made processes efficient. We have also made Doing Business Faster through digital processes and single point interfaces .”


    Underlining the importance of India’s growth and its strong economic fundamentals, the Prime Minister said, “ At 7.3 per cent, the average GDP growth has been the highest of any Indian government since 1991. At the same time, the average rate of inflation at 4.6 per cent is the lowest for any Indian government since 1991 when India began its process for liberalization.”


    He told the gathering that those, “ who visit India regularly will feel a change in air, in terms of direction and intensity. Over the last four years, the aim of my government is to reduce government and increase governance. We wish to take deeper structural reforms to strengthen our economy. We continue to remain one of the fastest growing economies in the world,"


    Prime Minister said that India has now one of the largest ecosystems in terms of start-ups and with its world-class research facilities provides the right kind of atmosphere for investment. He added that, “We have worked hard to promote manufacturing to create jobs for our youth. Investments through our 'Make in India' initiative, have been well supported by programmes like ‘Digital India’ and ‘Skill India’ “


    The PM added, “ We were among the highest growing tourist destinations in the world in 2017. India had a growth of 14 percent over 2016, while the world grew at an average of 7 percent in the same year. We have also been the fastest growing aviation market in the world, with double-digit growth in passenger ticketing terms, for over four years ”. He summed it up saying “ India is thus, a land of immense opportunities. It is the only place which offers you Democracy, Demography and Demand ”.


    About Vibrant Gujarat Summit, he said, “ It has now emerged as a global platform and presence of so many leaders shows that international cooperation is no longer limited to national capitals but is also extended to state capitals,"
