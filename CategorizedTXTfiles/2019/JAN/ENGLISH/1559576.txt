    The trans-Ganga/Yamuna areas in Prayagraj (namely Naini, Phaphamau &Jhunsi) currently do not have any sewage treatment facility and thereby pollute rivers Ganga and Yamuna.


    Prayagraj town already has a comprehensive sewerage network and sewage treatment facilities. However, these are with different operators and without long term sustainable mechanism for Operation and Maintenance (O&M).


    Accordingly, two projects have been sanctioned for sewage management in the trans-Ganga/Yamuna areas and O&M of existing sewerage assets costing Rs. 908.16 crore. These projects will lead to creation of I&D network and 3 STPs of total capacity 72 MLD (Naini - 42 MLD, Phaphamau - 14 MLD and Jhunsi - 16 MLD) and O&M of all the sewerage assets for 15 years. These two projects are under One City One Operator concept for implementation on Hybrid Annuity based PPP mode for the sewerage management of the town in sustainable and accountable manner and improve governance.


    These projects would lead to creation of new capacity of 72 MLD, rehabilitation of 80 MLD, operation & maintenance of existing STPs of 254 MLD capacity and 10 Sewage Pumping Stations.


    Director General, NMCG Shri Rajiv Ranjan Mishra informed the gathering that six projects in Prayagraj have already been completed which include Sewerage & Non sewerage Scheme for pollution abatement of river Ganga at District 'B' & 'E' with STP Capacity 85 MLD and sewer network 10.88 km, Sewerage Schemes for pollution abatement of river Ganga at District 'A' with STP Capacity 20 MLD and sewer network 9.24 km, Sewerage work in Sewerage District 'E' with sewer network 109.2 km , Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) at Salori (14 MLD) , Sewer network of 42.66 km in District E of Prayagraj - Part 2 (Additional Work) and Sewerage System of 134.19 km in Sewerage District 'C' & Allahapur.
