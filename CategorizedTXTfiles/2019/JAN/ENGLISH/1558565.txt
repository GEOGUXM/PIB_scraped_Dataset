    BBBP aims to address the issues of declining Child Sex Ratio (CSR) and enabling Girl Child education. Towards this purpose, multi-sectoral interventions are carried out in selected BBBP districts. Apart from this, an awareness campaign is carried out for creating awareness and visibility about the criticality of the issue of declining CSR in the country. To improve declining Child Sex Ratio in the country and to change the mindset is a long-term challenge. CSR is calculated on decadal basis by Registrar General of India through census. WCD Ministry has not made any impact assessment of the scheme, however as per the latest available reports of Health Management Information System (HMIS), data of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for 161 districts selected under BBBP during 2014-15 and 2015-16 indicate that for the time period between April-March, 2015-16 & 2016- 17, an improving trend in Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB) is visible in 104 districts, 119 districts have reported progress in first trimester registration against the reported Anti Natal Care registrations and 146 districts have reported improvement in institutional deliveries.
