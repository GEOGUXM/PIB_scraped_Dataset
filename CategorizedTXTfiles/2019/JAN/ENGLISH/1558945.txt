    Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin of Russia exchanged warm greetings for the Year 2019 in a telephonic conversation today. The Prime Minister also wished the President and Russian people on the occasion of Christmas, which is being celebrated in Russia today.


    The two leaders appreciated the major milestones achieved in the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between the two countries in the past year. Recalling successful wide-ranging discussions, inter alia, in Sochi in May and during President Putin's visit to New Delhi in October for the Annual Summit, the leaders agreed to maintain the momentum in the bilateral relations. President Putin reiterated the invitation to the annual Eastern Economic Forum in September 2019.


    Bilateral cooperation in the key areas including defence and counter-terrorism was also discussed.


    Both leaders agreed that India-Russia cooperation plays an important role in the global multilateral order. Both countries, therefore, will continue their close consultations in the United Nations, the BRICS, the SCO and other multilateral organizations.
