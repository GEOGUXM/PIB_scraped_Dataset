      Posted On: 03 JAN 2019 5:09PM by PIB Delhi


    At present, there are nine (9) nuclear power reactors at various stages of construction, targeted for completion by 2024-25. In addition, twelve (12) more nuclear power reactors have been accorded administrative approval and financial sanction by the Government in June 2017. Thus, twenty one (21) nuclear power reactors, with an installed capacity of 15700 MW are under implementation, envisaged for progressive completion by the year 2031. The details are as follows:

    *Nominal Capacity


    Discussions on finalization of project proposals in respect of setting up large size Light Water Reactors in collaboration with France at Jaitapur site in Maharashtra and USA at Kovvada site in Andhra Pradesh are underway. The cost of reactors to be set up at these sites will emerge on conclusion of the techno-commercial discussions and formulation of their project proposals. These reactors will be launched after the accord of administrative approval and financial sanction by the Government. At the other ‘In-Principle’ approved sites, the pre-project activities are at various stages.


    Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam Limited (BHAVINI), a PSU under Department of Atomic Energy, is currently constructing a 500 MWe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor at Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu. Further, it is proposed to construct a series of twin reactors as given below.

    The Government has taken several measures to enable setting up of nuclear power reactors in the country. These include:


    (i) Resolution of issues related to Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act & Creation of Indian Nuclear Insurance Pool (INIP).


    (ii) Amendment of the Atomic Energy Act-1962 (as amended from time to time) to enable Joint Ventures of Public Sector Companies to set up nuclear power projects in the country.


    (iii) Enabling agreements with the foreign countries for nuclear power cooperation including supply of fuel.


    (iv) Identification and addressing of the issues in implementation of the projects through Pro-Active Governance And Timely Implementation “PRAGATI” platform.


    The existing units are operating at their rated capacity. The unit size of indigenous Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) has already been increased from 220 MW to 540 MW and then to 700 MW, which are now under construction. In addition, Light Water Reactors of 1000 MW have also been introduced with foreign cooperation.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
