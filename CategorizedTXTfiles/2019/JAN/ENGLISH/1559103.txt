    The Programme was a 100% centrally sponsored gap filling till 2015-16. However, from 2016-17, on the recommendations of the Sub- Group of Chief Ministers, it has been classified as a Core Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) and is now part of the National Development Agenda. The funding pattern of BADP (like other Core CSSs), in respect of 8 North Eastern States (viz. Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura) & 3 Himalayan States (viz. Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Uttarakhand) is in the ratio 90:10 and in respect of 6 other States (viz. Bihar, Gujarat, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal) is in the ratio 60:40.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju in written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha today.
