    The Ministry has prepared a Labour Code on Industrial Relations, by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing the relevant provisions of the following three Labour Laws:-

     1. The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947,
     2. The Trade Unions Act, 1926,
     3. The Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946.

    The provisions of the draft Code have been discussed with stakeholders in various Tripartite Meetings and then finalized. At present, the Code is at pre-legislative Stage.


    This information was given by Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar Union Minister of State (I/C) for Labour and Employment in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
