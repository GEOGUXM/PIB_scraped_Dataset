    AMENDMENTS IN THE MINERAL AUCTION RULES


    The Mines and Mineral Development and Regulation Act, 1957 was amended in 2015. Subsequent to the amendment, the Ministry of Mines notified the Mineral Auction Rules, 2015 on 20/05/2015 to prescribe the procedure of the auction process.


    Auction of concessions for major minerals (other than coal, petroleum and natural gas) was done for the first time in the history of mineral administration in the country. 53 blocks were successfully allocated. The value of minerals auctioned out is Rs. 2,25,850.97 crore. Revenue to states over lease period are estimated at Rs. 1,83,181.59 crore. The additional revenue on account of auction process is Rs. 1,43,169.29 crore.


    The Ministry of Mines was monitoring the process very closely with the state governments. The consensus emerged that the Mineral Auction Rules need to be amended to make the process more pragmatic without sacrificing the checks on successful bidders. Accordingly, the Mineral Auction Rules have been amended on 30/11/2017.


    Amendments in the MINERAL CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT RULES (MCDR), 2017


    The lease period of merchant miners extended under the section 8A(6) of the MMDR Act, would expire on 31 st March, 2020. The auction process needs to be initiated well in advance to ensure a seamless transition from the existing to the new lessees as the new auctioned leases and that the mineral production is not affected due to expiry of these leases. Exploration of the blocks was required to done for the auction process of these mineral blocks. For expediting the exploration in these mines to be make them auction compliable, sub rule 4A was inserted in Rule 12 of Mineral Conservation and Development Rules, 2017 (MCDR-2017) by way of an amendment notification, published in Gazette of India vide G.S.R. No. 289 dated 27.03.2018. The rule mandates exploration in G2 level as stipulated under clause (a) of rule 5 of the Mineral (Evidence of Mineral Contents) Rules 2015, to be carried out in the mining leases expiring in 2020 by 1 st April, 2019. The rule also lays down the timelines for implementation of the exploration plan prepared with the approval of IBM for satisfying the requirements.


    AERO-GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY


    GSI has launched National Aero-geophysical Mapping Programme to cover 27 lakh line km of Obvious Geological Potential (OGP) and adjoining area in the country, The mapping of the total area divided into 12 blocks is envisaged to be completed in a period of 3 years by 2019 with total estimated cost of Rs.351 crore.


    New National Mineral Policy

      * Ministry of Mines vide its order No. 15/1/2017-M.V dated 14.08.2017 had constituted a Committee under the Chairmanship of Dr. K, Rajeswara Rao, Additional Secretary, M/o Mines, to review the National Mineral Policy, 2008 in accordance with the judgment dated 02.08.2017 delivered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of Common Cause Vs. UOl & Ors. [Writ Petition (Civil) No. 114 of 2014].

      * Based on the report submitted by the committee on 31.12.2017. Ministry of Mines prepared a draft National Mineral Policy (NMP) 2018 and uploaded it on the official website of the Ministry on 10.01.2018 for seeking comments/suggestions from the Stake Holders.


      * After suitably incorporating the comments/suggestions received from the concerned, a draft Cabinet Note on NMP 2018 was prepared and circulated to the concerned Ministries/ Departments for their comments/ views as part of the Inter Ministerial Consultation. Comments/ suggestions received from the Ministries/Departments have been suitably incorporated.


    STAR RATING OF MINES

      * Ministry of Mines, in its endeavor for taking up exhaustive and universal implementation of the Sustainable Development Framework (SDF) in mining, has evolved a system of Star Rating of Mines.
      * The Ministry of Mines instituted the Sustainable Development Framework (SDF) for taking up mining activity, encompassing inclusive growth, without adversely affecting the social, economic and environmental well-being, at present and also in future generation.
      * It has been institute as a two tier system providing self-evaluation templates to be filled in by the mine operator followed by validation through Indian Bureau of Mines.
      * The evaluation templates for Star Rating was notified vide notification dated 23.05.2016 for major minerals
      * Based on the performance of the mining lease, 1 to 5 star rating, the positive impact of getting higher Star Rating will drive miners to quickly adopt sustainable mining practices.
      * The Star Rating has been included as statutory provision in the MCDR for time- bound (2 years) achieving of minimum 4 stars.
      * A web enabled online system for evaluation of measures has been developed and launched on 18th August, 2016 as a vital step for ensuring compliance of environmental protection and social responsibility by the mining sector.
      * A template for star rating of miner minerals is also being prepared.
      * Since its inception, 9 mines in July 2016, 32 mines in February 2017 and 57 mines in March 2018 have been awarded “Five Star” rating so far, for assessment years 2014-15, 2015-16 & 2016-17 respectively. For the Assessment Year 2017-18, 966 mine operators have submitted online templates till date, out of which 246 lessee have self assessment of Five Star. Field verification/validation by IBM is in progress and so far 20 mines have been rated as five star.

    MINING SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (MSS)

      * Mining Surveillance System (MSS) is a satellite-based monitoring system which aims to establish a regime of responsive mineral administration by curbing instances of illegal mining activity through automatic remote sensing detection technology.
      * Ministry of Mines & Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) have developed the MSS, with assistance from Bhaskaracharya Institute for space applications and Geo-informatics (BISAG), Gandhinagar and Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY).
      * The system works on the basic premise that most minerals occur in the continuity and their occurrence is not limited to the lease area but is likely to extend in the vicinity. The MSS checks a region of 500 meters around the existing mining lease boundary to search for any unusual activity which is likely to be illegal mining. Any discrepancy is found is flagged-off as a trigger.
      * The MSS is a transparent & bias-free system, having a quicker response time and capability of effective follow-up. The deterrence effect of ‘Eyes watching from the Sky’ would be extremely fruitful in curbing instances of illegal mining.
      * A user friendly mobile app for MSS has been created and launched on 24th January, 2017 at Gandhinagar for enabling public participation in assisting the governments endeavor to curb illegal mining, which was being used by the inspecting officials to submit compliance reports of their inspections.
