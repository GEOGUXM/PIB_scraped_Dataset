    The Union Home Minister Shri Rajnath Singh said that knowledge can be used constructively with right moral and ethical values. He said that knowledge is a double edged sword and can make an individual either contribute to constructive or destructive activities. What makes the difference is the right moral and ethical values. Shri Rajnath Singh was addressing the gathering after laying the foundation stone of Kendriya Vidyalaya at Special Security Group, CISF Camp in Gautam Buddha Nagar, Uttar Pradesh today.


    The Union Home Minister said the information technocrats are contributing to nation building as India has emerged as the software hub. A few misguided youth however are using these very skills for anti-social activities by being influenced by the extremist groups such as the Al-Qaeda. He called upon the teachers to impart the right values and moral education to the students besides academic subjects.


    Shri Rajnath Singh said the new Central School will be a boon to the CAPF personnel since three CAPF Forces have camps here in the neighbourhood. Recently, the Home Minister inaugurated a Referral Hospital at this campus. The government is working towards providing Housing and Welfare facilities to CAPF personnel and their families in remote and far-flung areas, he added.


    Minister of State for Culture (I/C) and Environment, Forest & Climate Change, Dr. Mahesh Sharma, DG, CISG Shri Rajesh Ranjan were also present on the occasion.
