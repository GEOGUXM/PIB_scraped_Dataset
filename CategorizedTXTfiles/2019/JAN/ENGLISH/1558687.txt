      English rendering of PM’s Speech at the inauguration and foundation stone laying of various projects in Imphal, Manipur
      Posted On: 04 JAN 2019 6:25PM by PIB Delhi


    My dear brothers and sisters!


    It is a great coincidence that last year in the beginning of January, I was with you all for Science Congress and today I am with you all after inaugurating the Science Congress in Punjab yesterday.


    It's always great to be amongst you all. It is that part of the nation wherein diversity and unity can be felt in every corner of this region. The women here had given a boost and a direction to the freedom struggle. I salute the sisters of Manipur and all those who have laid down their lives during the freedom struggle.


    Friends,


    In Moirang, India's first interim government was formed. Our friends of the Northeast had fully supported the Azad Hind Fauj. A saying was very prevalent at that time, 'Non Pok Thong Hungani' i.e. the path of freedom will open from the east gate itself. The Azad Hind Fauj opened this gate once and then the enemy could never close it.


    Friends,


    We are now engaged in making Manipur and the Northeast, which Netaji had once made the gateway of freedom, a centre of development for New India now. The place from where you could see the new ray of freedom, from the same place you would be able to see a strong picture of the New India.


    Friends,


    In line with the same thinking, just a short while ago, about a dozen of new projects worth more than Rs.1500 crores have been either launched or their foundation stones have been laid. And I congratulate my brothers and sisters of Manipur for the same. These projects will make your lives easier. These will strengthen the facilities of education for the children, income for the youth, medicines for the elderly and irrigation for the farmers.


    Friends,


    You have been witnesses to the treatment meted out to Manipur and the Northeast by the previous governments in the past decades. Their attitude drove Delhi further away from you. For the first time, during Atal ji's tenure, there was an initiative to bring this important region of the country to the path of development. Today, the central government is vigorously pursuing his same initiative. We have brought Delhi to your door. Now unlike the earlier practice, the ministers and officers of the Centre do not just cut the ribbons and return to Delhi on the same day. Now they come and stay here amongst you all, listen to you, listen to your suggestions and understand your difficulties.


    I have come almost 30 times to Northeast during the past four and a half years. I meet you and interact with you all. It gives me a different pleasure. I don't have to ask for the reports from the officers. I get the report directly from you all. This is the difference between the previous governments and the present government. With such relentless efforts, we have turned detachment into attachment.


    Today because of these efforts, the entire Northeast is going through a phase of transformation. The projects that were in limbo for the past 30-40 years are now being completed. Efforts are going on to make your lives easier. If I give an example from Manipur itself, then a village here has become an important milestone in India's development journey. It has received an important recognition.


    Friends,


    Leisang village in the Kangpokpi district is the last village among the 18 thousand villages of the country that got rid of darkness in record time. Whenever there will be talk of the campaign to provide electricity to every village in India, the names of Leisang and Manipur will also be taken.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Today, Manipur has also received the gift of Integrated Check Post made at a cost of more than Rs. 125 crores. It is not just a check post, but also a center of dozens of facilities. Situated on the Indo-Myanmar border, this check post will facilitate passenger movement and trade. Besides, services like customer clearance, foreign exchange, immigration clearance, ATM, rest room etc. will also be available here. The national flag memorial is also being built here as a symbol of the country's honour and the first independent territory of the country.


    Friends,


    All the projects launched here today depict not only our government's commitment towards development but also reveals to you the work culture of previous governments.


    Brothers and sisters,


    The file of Dolaithabi Barrage was opened in 1987. Remember these things; the file was opened in 1987and the construction work had started in 1992 at a cost of Rs.19 crores. After that the matter got stuck. In 2004, it was made a part of the Special Economic Package but was left in a limbo for ten years.


    When we came to power in 2014, around 100 such projects across the country were reviewed. After that, the work started on this project and after spending Rs 500 crores this project of 19 crores is now ready. Had it been completed at that time, it would have been done at a cost of only Rs. 19-20 crores but as a result of their criminal negligence the project of Rs.19-20 crores reached Rs.500 crores. This money belongs to the citizens of India; this money belongs to you. They have allowed it to go waste.


    Friends,


    Had this project been completed earlier, thousands of farmers here wouldn't have had to yearn for water. Similarly, the Thangal Surung Eco-Tourism Complex, which provides employment to the youth of the city, also started in 2011. Our state government gave momentum to its work and today it is ready to serve you. The situation of Tupul's Integrated Tourist Destination Project was more or less similar. The work for this project started in the year 2009; our government expedited the work on it and today this facility which is boosting the tourism of Manipur is dedicated to you.


    Friends,


    Every section of the society, be it the farmers or the youth, had to suffer due to previous governments' culture of delaying projects. Our government is making sincere efforts to change the old habits of lethargy and negligence in the system. You must be wondering what Modi has done to expedite the schemes here. You can see the speed in the work. But today I want to tell you as well as countrymen the story behind this. How is this happening? It did not happen earlier; then how is it happening now? People are the same; the officers are the same; the office is the same; the files are the same. The needs of people are also similar, then why was the work not done? What solution did we find?


    Friends,


    After becoming the Prime Minister in 2014, I had a major challenge before me. I had to complete the decades old Projects which were in limbo for several years. Due to the approach of the previous governments, the work had slowed down. Their approach was to lay down the foundation stone of a project and win elections or to cut ribbons and win elections or to release press notes and win elections. This game was going on.


    You will be surprised to know that one Rs.100 crore project used to be completed at a cost of Rs.200-250 crores. How could I tolerate the wastage of money and resources? I could not bear it. It made me uncomfortable to see how every penny of the nation was being wasted. Had these projects been completed on time, the people there would have benefitted immensely. Therefore, I developed a system in the Prime Minister's Office and used technology in it. It was named 'PRAGATI'.


    In the PRAGATI meetings, I connect with the Central Government officials and the State Government officials through video conference. I hold question and answer sessions for each project. I try to understand the problem; then all of us together try to overcome the difficulties by sitting together in front of the video camera. I also encourage the officers and explain to them, and also assure them that they would have full cooperation of the government.


    Friends,


    Likewise, series of meetings continue and in dozens of such meetings, we have held discussions on projects worth Rs.12 lakh crores so far. These projects worth Rs.12 lakh crores were in limbo and were confined in files and foundation-stones were also missing. Those have now been found out and work is underway towards their implementation. Consequently, thousands of projects in the country which were delayed for decades have now been expedited. Our government has tried to develop such a work culture. A campaign has been started for breaking down the system of silos. Every department and every officer must work together; the centre and the states must work together and the centre must try to understand the problems faced by the states and the states should try to understand the needs of the centre. We have developed such a wonderful culture of Cooperative Federalism.


    Friends,


    We accomplish the targets set by us by putting all the hard work. We realize that the future generation of the country suffers the most from the delay in the schemes; those who have dreams suffer the most; those who want to accomplish something in life suffer the most. The poor, the ones facing challenges in life have to face greater difficulties. The common man suffers. I want to give you a few examples.


    The FCI Godown of Sawombung, important for the food security of Manipur, was inaugurated today. The work on it had started in December 2016 and we have completed this work today. Due to the timely completion, we could also save on excessive expenditure. An additional arrangement of 10,000 metric tonnes was also made to store the food grains needed for Manipur. A number of projects are underway to double the storage capacity in Manipur. They are also going to be completed soon.


    Similarly, work on the Buffer Water Reservoir started in November 2015, in view of the water needs of thousands of families in Ukhrul and its surroundings has also been completed. And today it was inaugurated. This project is going to meet the needs up to 2035.


    Work on the Churachandpur, Zone-Three project had also started in 2014 and was inaugurated today after four years. This will fulfil the water needs of about 1 lakh people here till 2030-31. Work on the scheme to quench the thirst of thousands of school children and families around the schools of Lambui had started in 2015 and were launched today after three years.


    Brothers and sisters,


    I have presented before you a small glimpse of the difference in the government's culture. There are many projects in the North-East which our government is completing even before the stipulated time. Our government is working to its full capacity to replace the old systems. In the coming days, work on the road project between Khabam Lamkhai and Hanchang Hunan, the Infectious Disease Center at Imphal, the new Community Health Center, and mini sports complex will also start here.


    Friends,


    Whether it is the central government or the government of Biren Singh ji in Manipur, our vision is 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'. No one or no area should be left out of development. The state government is reaching far-flung areas under the programmes like “Go to hills” or “Go to Villages”. Attempt to make the people a part of government schemes is commendable. This is the reason why Manipur today is trying to fulfil the hopes and aspirations by coming out of the Bandhs and blockade era. It depicts that this nation is a witness to the same.


    Friends,


    There is a need for peace and better law for development. Connectivity is equally necessary and that is why we are working on the vision of 'transformation by transportation'. In the last four and a half years, about two and a half thousand kilometers of national highways have been added in the entire North-East. More than 300 km of national highways have been added in Manipur since 2014.


    Bridges worth about 2 thousand crore rupees are being constructed in collaboration with the state government. At the same time, work is being done to connect the capitals of all the North-Eastern states with the railways. Work on 15 new railway lines worth about 50 thousand crore rupees is underway. A new rail line is also being laid between Jiribam to Tupul-Imphal in Manipur. The Jiribam-Imphal Rail Bridge, an example of the country's engineering skills, is also going to be a major foundation for the development of the North-East.


    Friends,


    Air connectivity here is being improved along with the highways and railways. Imphal is being connected by helicopter services to remote areas like Jiribam, Tamenglong and Moreh. Five helipads are being constructed under the UDAN scheme which will be linked to the Imphal Airport. Imphal International Airport is being expanded and an air cargo terminal will also start here in the coming days. Besides highways, railways, and airways, I-ways are also being built in Manipur, i.e. the Information Ways will soon connect all the panchayats and districts of Manipur with Digital Broadband I-way, which will directly deliver the benefits of the social schemes to the people. Crores of rupees are also being spent for the same.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Besides connectivity, the power system is also being strengthened here. Today, 400 kV Silchar-Imphal line has also been dedicated to the nation. This line, built at a cost of more than Rs. 700 crores, will solve the problem of power cut.


    Friends,


    Manipur is on the path of development today at every level. Manipur has also freed itself from open defecation through Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Chandel district, which is among more than a hundred aspirational districts of the country, has also seen a lot of improvement in all parameters.


    Brothers and sisters,


    Several schemes have been implemented to ensure that the young friends of Manipur do not have to go to other parts of the country for higher education and professional education. Today, the foundation stone for the projects related to education, skill and sports has been laid. Infrastructure related projects in Dhanamanjuri University or the projects related to the engineering college, will help the young friends.


    Friends,


    Manipur has also been ahead in terms of women empowerment. Soon our government will also begin the work on three new Ema Markets to further strengthen the economic empowerment of the sisters of Manipur. Besides, Jan Dhan bank accounts of about five lakh sisters have been opened by the government. Half of the 1 lakh 25 thousand loans received by the youth here under the Mudra scheme are by women entrepreneurs. At the same time, about one lakh sisters have been given free LPG gas connection through Ujjwala scheme.


    Friends,


    A Youth icon and a great example of women power in the country, Mary Kom's birthplace and work place is full of immense possibilities for sports. North-East is going to play a major role in making India a super power in sports. In every international tournament that has taken place in the last 3-4 years, the country has performed enthusiastically due to the strength of the players of North East. The National Sports University of Manipur is now enhancing the strength of the North East. Even the schemes which have been launched today include the schemes of installing flood lights in hockey stadium and Astroturf in football stadium.


    We are trying to provide the best facilities for sports in the smallest of the areas of ​​the country. Moreover, we are also building a transparent system of training and selection process. Consequently, we are able to see the results in the Commonwealth Games, the Asian Games, the Para Asian Games, in the Youth Olympics and in other World Championships. The nation is feeling proud.


    Brothers and sisters,


    The nation can never tolerate corruption, be it in the sports sector or in other government schemes. This is the reason why our government has brought even those people under the law, about whom no one could have imagined before. You are also seeing those who have betrayed the country, who made corruption their normal practice. Such people are facing legal actions today. I have come here to assure you that we will not stop unless we catch those who did favours to their loved ones with the money of honest taxpayers of the country.


    I hope that your blessings which have been on me remain upon me always for our resolution of a corruption-free New India and its development. Once again, I congratulate you for the foundation stone laying ceremony and inauguration of today's projects. "Pum na makpu amukka hanna khurumjari"


    Bharat Mata Ki Jai!!


    Bharat Mata Ki Jai!!


    Bharat Mata Ki Jai!!


    Thanks a lot.
