    Shri Hardeep S. Puri, Minister of State (I/C) for Housing and Urban Affairs, has informed that a fortnight of events named ‘Shehri Samridhi Utsav’, focusing on urban livelihoods is being organised by his Ministry, from 1 st -15 th February 2019. The event aims at extending the outreach of National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM) to the poorest of the poor and the most vulnerable, showcase its initiatives and facilitate access of SHG members to the other government schemes. Shri Puri was addressing members of the media here today. Shri Durga Shanker Mishra, Secretary, MoHUA and Shri Sanjay Kumar, Mission Director DAY-NULM were also present at the Conference.


    Shri Puri informed the gathering that Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana DAY-NULM addresses multiple dimensions of urban poverty by developing strong community-based organizations, providing placement oriented skill training, providing subsidized loans for self-employment ventures, supporting street vendors’ livelihoods and establishing shelter for the homeless. Elaborating further, Shri Puri said the Mission has made significant progress on all these fronts –

     1. Over 34 lakh urban poor women have been organized into Self Help Groups and their federations.
     2. Over 8.9 lakh candidates have been skill trained and certified with over 4.6 lakh provided placement,
     3. Over 8.5 lakh individuals and groups have been supported to access subsidized loans.
     4. 1,098 shelters have been made functional creating capacity for more than 60,000 urban homeless.
     5. 16 lakh street vendors have been identified through survey in 2,430 cities and half of them have been given identity cards.

    Addressing the media, Shri Durga Shanker Mishra informed that various activities will be organized at the city, state and national level, with the active participation from the States and Cities. The city level activities planned during the event will include the following -

      * A survey named ‘Safety Net Survey’ is being conducted to identify eligible SHG members not covered by government programs viz. SBM(U), PMAY(U), Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Surakhsa Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Yojana and National Nutrition Mission. The necessary formalities will be completed by 31 st January 2019 and the sanction letters/benefits are planned to be distributed during the pakhwada .
      * SHG members across cities will participate in a rally to spread awareness about DAY-NULM. Revolving Funds will be provided to all eligible SHGs.
      * A drive to form new SHGs, especially for vulnerable sections such as informal sanitation workers, manual scavengers, and waste pickers, will be taken up.
      * A new platform called Shehri Sahabhagita Manch has been proposed for regular meetings of ULB officials with SHG federations. This would increase participation of these collectives of the urban poor in resolution of local issues and create a mechanism for ULBs to identify gaps in provision of basic services in urban poor settlements.
      * Loan camps would be organized by banks close to the urban poor colonies, to facilitate access to credit for micro-enterprises of the urban poor. Further, all pending loan applications are proposed to be disposed by 31 st January 2019.
      * Shelters for the urban homeless under DAY-NULM would be adopted by colleges located nearby. This would create a healthy interactive environment for shelter residents and a good learning experience for college students.
