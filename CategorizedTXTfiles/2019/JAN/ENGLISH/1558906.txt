Currently there are 429 colleges/universities under these schemes. NSDC also has collaboration with Public and Private Universities to skill the students of the colleges who are undergoing UG and/or PG program only. Approximately, 1 lakh students are covered under 165 BVOC colleges, 223 Community Colleges and 64 DDU Kaushal Kendra Colleges. Further, NSDC has collaborated with Ministry of Human Resource Development for restructuring of BVOC by rolling out embedded apprenticeship under National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS). BVOC has multiple exits at Certificate, Diploma, Advance Diploma and Degree levels. Through this, the employability of the general graduates is enhanced considerably as the student can have professional experience on the shop-floor, along with their graduation
