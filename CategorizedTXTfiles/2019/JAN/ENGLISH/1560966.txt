It is also to identify youth with leadership qualities and good communication skills for their holistic development and empowerment. This will enable them to take lead in understanding the functions and policies of the government towards nation building.NYKS has been organizing National Level Declamation Contest since 2015-16. From the current financial year i.e. 2018-19, the Declamation Contest has been added in the list of core programme under Annual Action Plan.


    So far, 40192 contestants from 4020 blocks, 9281 contestants belonging to 556 Districtsof the country and 500 contestants from 29 States have participated in the Declamation Contest since its inception in 2015. The Block, District & State level Declamation Contest for the year 2018-19 has been organised from September 2018 to 15 th January 2019.


    The activities carried out by NYKS not only reach the masses in the country but also provide youth an opportunity to exhibit their presentation skills, art of public speaking and engage in positive discussion. The topic of declamation would help a great deal in creating awareness about the Prime Ministerâ€™s Flagship Financial and Social Inclusion Schemes denouncing all kinds of social evilsand promoting the spirit of Patriotism .
