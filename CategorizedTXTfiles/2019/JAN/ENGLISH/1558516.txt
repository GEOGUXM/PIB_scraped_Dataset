    With an aim to align the industry requirements with the technical skill set of students, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has developed outcome based, socially and industrially relevant Model Curriculum for Under Graduate (UG) and Post Graduate (PG) Programme in Engineering and technical subjects e.g. MBA, PGDM, Pharmacy, Architecture etc . It allows the students to take electives from the disciplines and cross- disciplines, provision for internship to understand the industry requirements, have hands-on experience and to pursue project work, relevant to industry, in their final year. This is a suggestive curriculum and the concerned University/ Institution is allowed flexibility in readjustment of course/ credits taking in account the local industry needs. The comparison between the institutions following the model curricula and others is not possible at this stage as it is the first year of implementation of model curriculum.


    This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Dr. Satya Pal Singh today in a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question.
