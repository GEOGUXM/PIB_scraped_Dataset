      Prime Minister's Office

      English rendering of PM’s statement to Media ahead of the Budget Session of Parliament on 31st January 2019
      Posted On: 31 JAN 2019 11:30AM by PIB Delhi


    Wish you all many many best wishes for 2019. Today the budget session is beginning. Shortly, respected Rashtrapatiji will address the joint session of both the Houses. We have seen the attitude of the House last time. Today, there is awareness in the country; each citizen minutely observes the proceedings of the House. Today, every minor incident in the country has a lot of reach, and so everything reaches the common man. Naturally, there is resentment in the society against those who have no interest in discussions and debates.


    I hope all our respected parliamentarians will keep the public sentiments in mind and will utilize this budget session. They should take part in the debates thoroughly and comprehensively with complete information, should present their views, and benefit the House as well as the government. Our respected parliamentarians should make the maximum use of the session to complete the work. This is my expectation from them. And I also know that they will also benefit from their best and constructive behavior in the House when they go to their constituencies.


    I believe everybody will agree to it seriously. We have worked with the Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas mantra and we are committed to it. We want to move ahead with the decisions for the country’s development with the cooperation of everybody in the House. This will be our endeavour. We are ready to debate every issue. I will welcome the discussions with an open mind, the smooth proceedings of the House, and all members should feel proud to contribute for building a future India.


    Many many thanks
