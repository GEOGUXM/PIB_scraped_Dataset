    The first experimental mission of a sub-scale Scramjet engine, towards the realization of an Air Breathing Propulsion System, was successfully conducted on August 28, 2016 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota. With this experimental flight, critical technologies such as ignition of air breathing engines at supersonic speed, holding the flame at supersonic speed, air intake mechanism and fuel injection systems have been successfully demonstrated. The Air breathing propulsion technology will be useful during the atmospheric phase of the flight of launch vehicle as the oxidizer for the fuel is derived from the atmosphere itself. This reduces the need for carrying the oxidizer along with the fuel and will benefit in bringing down the cost of access to space.


    The present developed technology is useful for launch vehicles and missiles and is not directly applicable for spacecraft propulsion.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
