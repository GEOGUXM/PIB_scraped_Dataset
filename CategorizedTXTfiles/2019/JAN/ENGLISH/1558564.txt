      Posted On: 04 JAN 2019 12:47PM by PIB Delhi


    The mapping of field functionaries on Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana-Common Application Software (PMMVY-CAS) using Local Government Directory (LGD) Code allows implementing the scheme independent of the implementing Department in States/UTs. The various Departments like Health, Women & Child Development or Social Welfare are implementing the scheme in various States/UTs. It also allows hierarchical monitoring of scheme from Pan-India to village level. Further, it allows tracking the boarding status of villages where the field functionaries for implementing PMMVY are active.


    Under Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), Review Meeting cum Workshops, as well as National level Workshops are conducted regularly for highest level monitoring and review the implementation of scheme in all States/ UTs. Review is also undertaken through video conferences with all the States/UTs periodically to monitor the progress. The scheme is implemented through web based Software, viz. PMMVY-CAS which has dashboard for regular monitoring/ review of the scheme.


    The details of suggestions/feedback reported by the users from the State/UT regarding functioning/ implementation of the scheme along with the action taken by the Government are given below:
