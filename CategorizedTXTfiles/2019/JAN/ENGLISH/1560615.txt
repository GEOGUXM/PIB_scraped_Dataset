    Welcoming the Czech Prime Minister to India, the President fondly remembered his own visit to the Czech Republic in September, 2018. He said that India counts the Czech Republic as a key partner in its growth story. He thanked the government of the Czech Republic for hosting the ‘Czech Make in India’ pavilion at the Vibrant Gujarat Summit in Gandhinagar. He said that there are immense opportunities for Czech technology and manufacturing in India.
