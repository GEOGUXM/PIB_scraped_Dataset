    Ms Erna Solberg, the Prime Minister of Norway, called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, at Rashtrapati Bhavan today (January 8, 2019).


    Welcoming the Norwegian Prime Minister to India, the President said that India and Norway share warm and friendly relations. As two vibrant democracies, with deep respect for the rule of law, cultural diversity and human rights, we are natural partners.


    The President said that India-Norway bilateral trade has been growing but there is potential for expansion. Energy, IT, health and technology sectors present opportunities. Norwegian capability in shipping, port management, fishing, defence and energy is globally known. India seeks Norwegian partnerships in these areas to support its own programmes such as Make in India, Smart Cities, Clean India, Start-up India and the Sagarmala project.
