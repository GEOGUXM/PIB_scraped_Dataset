      Posted On: 16 MAR 2019 5:44PM by PIB Thiruvananthpuram


    Southern Naval Command (SNC) has hired services of Multi-Purpose Vessel MV Triton Liberty from M/s Triton Maritime Pvt Ltd for providing Logistics Support to Lakshadweep & Minicoy Islands, sorties across Kerala and Mahe, support to naval harbour operations and other miscellaneous support functions for a period of one year commencing mid Mar 2019. The contract was signed between Commodore Deepak Kumar, VSM Chief Staff Officer (Operations), SNC and Mr Chetan Parekh, Director, Triton Maritime Pvt Ltd on 15 Mar 2019.


    Th e hiring was conducted through online open tendering process. Hiring of the vessel would substantially enhance the support to Naval detachments at Lakshadweep & Minicoy Islands wherein a fixed schedule for turnaround of personnel from naval detachments can be pursued addressing long felt need of personnel deputed at these islands. This would be particularly beneficial during monsoon months when passenger shipsâ€™ schedule gets severely reduced, as also during peak traffic seasons such as school holidays. The vessel with advanced firefighting system can also be employed for Humanitarian and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations at sea. Integration of the vessel would relieve the Naval ships from Logistics support duties for role specific operations.
