      Posted On: 08 MAR 2019 6:50PM by PIB Thiruvananthpuram


    Creating a landmark in the history of inland movement through National Waterways 3 & 9, the first barge named KPACT-1 with four (40 feet) import loaded containers was flagged off today from ICTT Cochin by Chairman(I/C), Cochin Port Trust in the presence of Chief Commissioner of Customs, officials of the Port, DP World, Customs, Shipping Line & Kottayam Port. The barge will travel to Kottayam Port & ICD reducing carbon footprint and congestion on the roads. A regular service between ICTT Cochin & Kottayam Port & ICD will greatly benefit the importers & exporters by way of reduced haulage for the last & first mile connectivity. It is expected that the cost of movement by waterway will be 30 to 40% cheaper compared to road movement. This is in line with the objective of ‘Sagarmala’, the flagship programme of Ministry of Shipping, Government of India.


    Incidentally, this was the result of the initiative taken by Cochin Port Trust. On 5th March’19, Sri A. V. Ramana, Chairman(I/C) took a meeting of all the stakeholders to discuss the possibility of early commencement of such a service & to encourage use of National Waterways for inland movement as waterways have always been an important mode of transport in Kerala.
