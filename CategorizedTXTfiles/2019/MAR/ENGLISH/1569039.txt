    Separate groups of officer trainees of the Indian Audit and Accounts Service (IAAS) and the Central Engineering Services (Roads) together called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, today (March 18, 2019) at Rashtrapati Bhavan.


    Addressing the officer trainees, the President said that IAAS officers play a critical role in ensuring the accountability of the executive to the legislature. The reports of the CAG, submitted to the legislature, play a pivotal part in enforcing this accountability. As officers of the IAAS they are guardians of public trust and financial prudence. He advised them to always bear in mind that the objective of an audit should be to improve governance strategies. He said that the credibility of their findings will determine the utility of the audit for enhancing the quality of governance.


    The President said that the Central Engineering Services (Roads) is an important contributor to what is one of the most exciting phases of road and highway development in Indian history. The challenge now is not just to build more but to build better and to build safer. Use of new technologies to make roads more durable and cost-effective in the long run should be a key determining factor while designing projects. He said that as automobile traffic in India increases issues of speed and safety also arise. The number of traffic accidents and deaths in India is far too high for comfort. He urged the engineers to be mindful of this problem and try to minimise if not entirely eliminate road tragedies in India.
