      Posted On: 20 MAR 2019 5:34PM by PIB Delhi


    In another inspring example of indigenisation of defence equipment, 5 Metre Short Span Bridge was formally handed over to the Indian Army on 20 March 2019 in a ceremony at the Talegaon facility of Larsen & Toubro Limited. The Bridge is indigenously designed & developed and is the result of close coordination between the Corps of Engineers and the DRDO laboratory at Pune R&DE (Engineers). The equipment has been manufactured by Larsen & Toubro Limited and has been delivered three months ahead of schedule. All stakeholders have put in concerted efforts to overcome challenges and realise the ‘Make in India’ initiative of the government, which aims to ensure self sufficiency in our defence needs.


    The Bridge will meet the important requirement of providing mobility to own forces by speedy establishment of bridges. The Bridge is one of the numerous indigenous projects of Corps of Engineers which have made significant progress and are nearing induction and will soon join the units of Corps of Engineers.
