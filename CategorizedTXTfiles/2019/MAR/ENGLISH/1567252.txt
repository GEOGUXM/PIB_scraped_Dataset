    The Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu has visited the historic National War Memorial, built in the premises of India Gate, here today.


    The Vice President said that he was overwhelmed with emotion to visit the National War Memorial. I am happy that we have a National War Memorial dedicated to the thousands of India’s defence personnel who laid down their lives to defend India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, he said. This edifice will keep the flame of patriotism eternally shining within each Indian’s heart and illuminate our future pathways, he added.


    Shri Naidu said that with a unique Indian design, it has four concentric circles named Amar Chakra, Veerta Chakra, Tyag Chakra and Rakshak Chakra. He further said that the names of all our soldiers who died in defence of India are etched in stone in these concentric circles. It also has the statues of all the Pram Vir Chakra awardees, he added.


    The Vice President said that this war memorial is an eternal reminder of the great sacrifices of our brave soldiers who have guarded our motherland and peace prevailed. Ours soldiers are the unsung heroes of our democracy and they are the silent conscientious sentinels of peace. Let us pay sincere homage to the fallen heroes, he added.


    Shri Naidu paid tributes to all the soldiers and hoped that all citizens will keep remembering the role brave soldiers play in the country’s security.
