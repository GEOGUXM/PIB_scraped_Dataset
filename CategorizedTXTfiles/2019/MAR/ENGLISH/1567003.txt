    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today flagged off the Tejas Express between Madurai and Chennai. At a large public function in Kanyakumari, he also laid the Foundation Stone for the restoration of rail connectivity between Rameswaram and Dhanushkodi, and the restoration of the Pamban bridge. The Prime Minister inaugurated some road projects as well.


    Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister said that every Indian is proud that the brave Wing Commander Abhinandan belongs to Tamil Nadu.


    He also congratulated the Vivekananda Kendra on being conferred the Gandhi Peace Prize a few days ago.


    He said the Tejas Express is one of the most modern trains and is a great example of ‘Make in India.’


    He said that the Rameswaram-Dhanushkodi rail line got damaged after the disaster of 1964 but for over fifty years, no attention was paid to this line. Better late than never, he added.


    The Prime Minister said as part of the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, over 1.1 crore farmers have already got their first instalment in their bank accounts. He said a scheme announced on 1st February has become a reality in the same month itself. We worked 24 hours non-stop to ensure the scheme is rolled out in 24 days, he added. He said in ten years, about 7.5 lakh crore rupees would have been received by hard-working farmers.


    The Prime Minister said that people want honesty, development, progress, opportunities and security from the Government.


    Talking about defence and security, the Prime Minister said that India has been facing the menace of terrorism for years. He said that the big difference now is that India will no longer be helpless in the wake of terror. He said that this is a New India that will return the damage done by terrorists with interest. In matters of defence and national security, we are Indians first and Indians only, the Prime Minister asserted.


    The Prime Minister also elaborated upon the steps taken by the Union Government against corruption.
