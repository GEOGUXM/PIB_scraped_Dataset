    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:


         1. Crude oil production by ONGC during February, 2019 was 1598.79 TMT which is 14.16%lower than the monthly target and5.09%lower when compared with February, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-February, 2018-19 was 19273.94TMT which is 8.10% and 5.38% lower than the cumulative target and production respectively,during the corresponding period oflast year.Reasons for shortfall are as under:


      * Electric submersible pump (ESP) problem in some wells of NBP field.

      * Loss from WO-16 fields in the absence of MOPUs SagarSamrat.
      * Sub-sea leakage in some well fluid lines of Mumbai High &NeelamHeera Asset, leading to flow restriction.
      * Less than envisaged production due to reduced EOR effect in Santhal and Balol fields in Mehsana. Air injection rates under optimization.

         1. Crude oil production by OIL during February, 2019 was243.68 TMT which is 19.93%lower than monthly target and 6.45% lower when compared with February, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-February, 2018-19 was 3015.06 TMT which is 11.24% and 2.57% lower than the cumulative target and production respectively during the corresponding period of last year.Reasons for shortfall are as under:


      * Loss from bandh and miscreant activities in operational areas.

      * Less than planned contribution from work over well and drilling wells.

         1. Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs in PSC regime during February, 2019 was 721.25 TMT which is 8.94% lower than the monthly target and8.30%lowerthanFebruary, 2018.Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-February, 2018-19 was 9059.98TMT which is 3.21% and 1.29% lower than the cumulative target and production respectively during the corresponding period of last year.Major reasonsin for lower production are;


      * Loss from Mangala due to delay in upgrade of Mangala Processing Terminal (MPT) and delay in drilling, completion and hooking up online 45 infill wells(CEIL).

      * Lower yield from NE development drilling campaign due to geological uncertainties(CEIL).
      * Closure of around 98 oil wells due to various reasons like liquid handling constraint at MPT plant, pump failure, surface facility limitation, etc(CEIL).

    2.Natural Gas


    Natural gas production during February, 2019 was 2565.75 MMSCM which is 3.29% higher when compared with February, 2018 although 8.71% lower than the target for the month. Cumulative natural gas production during April-February, 2018-19 was 30057.41MMSCM which is marginally higher by0.64% when compared with the production during corresponding period of last year, but is lowerby 7.53% than target for the period.Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II . Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of February, 2019 and cumulatively for the period April-February, 2018-19vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

    Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production


         1. Natural gas production by ONGC during February, 2019 was 1953.74 MMSCM which is 8.54% higher when compared with February, 2018 although 4.46% lower than the target for the month. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC duringApril-February, 2018-19 was 22539.76MMSCM which is 5.07% lower than the cumulative target but5.25% higher than the production during the corresponding period of the last year. Some of the reasons for lower production viz monthly target is decline in p ressure/potential in GS-4 Gas cap reservoir in Gandhar field.


         1. Natural gas production by OIL during February, 2019 was 203.70MMSCM which is 8.92% lower than the monthly targetand2.69% lower than February, 2018. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-February, 2018-19 was 2486.78 MMSCM which is 13.03% and 5.97% lower than the cumulative target and production respectively during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall are as under:


      * Loss of potential in Deohal area due to presence of CO 2 in production stream.

      * Loss from bandh and miscreant activities in operational areas.

         1. Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during February, 2019 was 408.31 MMSCM which is 24.65% lower than the monthly target and14% lower when compared with February, 2018. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-February, 2018-19 was 5030.87MMSCM which is 14.75% lower than the cumulative target and13.25% lower than the production during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * Sohagpur West CBM Block: Increase in number of wells requiring workover due to sanding, scaling and resultant pump replacement requirement etc. 36 development wells which are still under dewatering phase and gas breakout is yet to be seen. (RIL)

      * Loss from Mangala due to delay in upgrade of Mangala Processing Terminal (MPT) and delay in drilling, completion and hooking up online 45 infill wellsand lower inputs from NE development drilling campaign (CEIL).

     1. Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)


    Refinery production during February, 2019 was 20083.43TMT which is marginally higher (0.01%) when compared with February, 2018, but 1.54%lower than the target for the month. Cumulative production during April-February, 2018-19 was 234709.43 TMT which is 0.69% and 1.69% higher than the cumulative target and production respectively during the corresponding period of last year. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III . Company-wise production for the month of February, 2019 and cumulatively for the period April-February, 2018-19 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

         1. CPSE Refineries’ production during February, 2019 was 11939.71TMT which is 2.26%higher than the monthly targetand3.94%higher when compared with February, 2018.Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-February, 2018-19 was 138221.71 TMT which is 1.98% and 4.16% higher than the cumulative target and production respectively during the corresponding period of last year. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


      * IOCL-Guwahati: Lower due to Crude Distillation Unit(CDU) idling for 3days due to extended Delayed Coker Unit shutdown.

      * IOCL-Gujarat: Lower due to Intermediate Stock (ISD) depletion for Vacuum Gas Oil – Teater (VGO-T) shutdown
      * NRL Numaligarh: Lower due to less Crude receipt.

    3.2 Production in JV refineries during February, 2019 was 1642.33TMT which is 13.03% higher than the target for the month and13.56% higherwhen compared with February, 2018.Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-February, 2018-19 was 16391.13TMT which is 4.69% and 17.05% higher than the cumulative target and production respectively during the corresponding period of last year.


    3.3 Production in private refineries during February, 2019 was 6501.38TMT which is lowerby 10.56% than the target for the month and9.04% lowerwhen compared with February, 2018. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-February, 2018-19 was 80096.59 TMT which is 2.21% and 4.76% lower than the cumulative target and production respectively during the corresponding period of last year.


    3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of February, 2019 and cumulatively for the period April-February, 2018-19vis-à-vis April-February, 2017-18 are given at Annexures -IV and V respectively.
