      No Ban on use of Diesel Agriculture Pumps
      Posted On: 08 MAR 2019 5:21PM by PIB Delhi


    It has come to notice that some unscrupulous elements have been spreading the message among farmers in the NCR that use of diesel agriculture pumps have been banned by the Hon’ble National Green Tribunal (NGT). They are apparently harassing the farmers and forcing them to buy new pumps. There has been no such order so far by Hon’ble NGT and it is clarified that Hon’ble NGT vide its order dated April 07, 2015 in OA No. 95 / 2014 had directed that all diesel vehicles (heavy or light) which are more than 10 years old, will not be permitted on the roads of National Capital Region(NCR), Delhi.


    Therefore, it is made abundantly clear that aforesaid order relates to diesel vehicles and not to agriculture pumps using diesel .


    This is also for the information of all State Governments and the enforcement agencies to make sure that such misinformation campaign should not be allowed to continue and to ensure that farmers are not harassed.
