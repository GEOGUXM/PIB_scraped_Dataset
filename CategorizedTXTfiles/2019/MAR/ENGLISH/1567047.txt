    Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari will inaugurate a four-lane flyover at Dhaula Kuan junction near Dhaula Kuan Metro Station on NH 8 tomorrow. The flyover, which will reduce waiting time at the traffic light by 30 minutes at peak hours, is the first step towards development of an eight-lane, signal free Dhaula Kuan – Airport corridor.


    National Highway No.8 (New NH-48) is the prime link providing connectivity to IGI Airport from Delhi and NCR. The frequent traffic jams in the corridor results in travel time of 10-30 minutes in crossing this stretch of about 3 kms. NHAI has taken up development of signal free corridor from Dhaula Kuan interchange to Airport at an estimated cost of Rs.270 crore. The work on the project commenced in March, 2018.


    The project has huge challenges in terms of traffic management of about 3 lakhs PCUs per day, presence of a large number of Civil and Defence utilities, shifting of Defence infrastructure and getting security clearances. The work on the project started 274 days back, out of which work could not be executed on 136 days on account of security restrictions and environmental prohibitions. So the work of the flyover was completed in a record time of just 136 working days.


    Besides the flyover being inaugurated tomorrow, the complete signal free Dhaula Kuan – Airport corridor consists of widening of Dhaula Kuan – IGI corridor from 6-lanes to 8-lanes, a three-lane flyover from Janakpuri road to merge with NH-8, three-lane vehicular underpass at Parade Road junction, 3 PUPs, 2 VUPs and an FOB for pedestrians.


    This project would be in addition to the nine other projects being implemented for decongesting NCR Delhi. These include the 22 km, 6-lane elevated corridor on Gurugram-Sohna Road costing Rs 2000 Crore on which work has started; 8-lane Delhi-Panipat highway from Mukarba Chowk to Panipat on NH-1 being constructed at a cost of Rs 2300 and nearly 48 % done; the 29 km, 8 lane access controlled Dwarka Expressway costing about Rs 9500 crore on which work has started; package II, III and IV of Delhi-Meerut Expressway costing Rs 5900 Crore, where package II is 36 % done, package III in 76% done and package IV is 32 % done; 4 laning of 124 km Khekra – EPE junction to Shamli-Saharanpur (NH-709 B) at a cost of about Rs 1200 Crore; Rangpuri Bypass to connect Dwarka/NH-08 with Vasant Kunj-Nelson Mandela Road at a cost of Rs 1000 Crore, which is in DPR stage; 75 km Urban Extension Road (UER-2) third Ring Road for Delhi under Bharatmala to be developed at a cost of Rs 4000 Crore which is in DPR stage and the 31.3 km, 6-lane access controlled corridor from Akshardham NH24 Junction to EPE Junction on Baghpat Road at a cost of about Rs 2600 Crore.
