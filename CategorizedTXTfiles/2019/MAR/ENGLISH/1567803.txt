    Financial implications:

      * Each ATL receives a grant in aid of Rs. 12 lakhs in the first year, and upto 2 lakhs per year for subsequent 4 years, for maintenance of the ATL equipment and operational expenses.
      * Each selected AIC would be receiving grant in aid upto Rs 10 crore over 3-5 years in tranches per year, based on review and evidence of planned milestones reached.
      * Innovators will receive commercialization and technology deployment grants upto Rs. 1 crore under the ANICs.

    Impact:

      * The potential for employment generation from these innovations driven Startups is quite high.

    Implementation Strategy and targets:


    AIM selects each beneficiary through open, competitive, online applications, and disburses grants directly. Furthermore, AIM leverages its experts and networks around the country to build capacity in ATLs, AICs, etc. connecting various kinds of populations. Additionally, corporate and international partners are connected to AIM beneficiaries, to ensure flow of information and technology between academia, innovation, and the start-up ecosystem as well as provide mentoring support to ensure success of AIM's initiatives. Till date, 5441 Atal Tinkering Labs have been selected across the country, out of which 2171 ATLs from 623 districts have already received the first tranche of grant-in-aid for establishment of the labs in their respective schools. 101 Atal Incubation Centres have been selected nationwide, out of which 31 have received the first tranche of grants.


    Twenty-four Atal New India Challenges (ANIC) have been launched and more than 800 applications have been received. 2-3 winners per ANIC would be selected and receive a grant of upto Rs 1.0 crore in 3 tranches based on review and evidence of planned milestones achieved.


    AIM's Mentor of Change Programme is mandated to ensure the success of the ATLs. Through this programme, well-qualified mentors from different professional backgrounds are selected to provide pro-bono mentoring to ATL students over a range of skills. Mentors also collaborate with the School administrators to ensure the ATLs operate in the manner, mandated by AIM. As on date, more than 2,500 mentors are actively mentoring students in over 1,300 ATL schools.


    Background:


    AlM's objectives are to create and promote an ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship across the country at school, university, research institutions, MSME and industry levels. The Mission has been set up under NITI Aayog, in accordance with the Hon'ble Finance Minister's declaration in the 2015 Budget Speech.
