      Posted On: 07 MAR 2019 6:24PM by PIB Delhi


    The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has decided to mandate advanced braking systems, technologies and performance requirements for improved road safety and reducing accidents. The provision will be binding on all vehicles with 9 seats and above. A notification to this effect was issued yesterday. The existing vehicles will be required to adopt new provisions with effect from April 2021, while all new vehicles rolling out from April 2022 will have these pre-fitted.


    This includes mandatory fitment of Anti lock braking system, introduction of stringent braking performance, endurance braking requirements, intelligent braking system to assist drivers in managing braking force, and electronic stability for better stability and to reduce roll over. With this, Indian braking regulations will be at par with European standards.
