      Press Statement
      Posted On: 06 MAR 2019 4:30PM by PIB Delhi


    Post our warning to the Pakistan Army “ NOT to target civilian areas ”, the overall situation along the Line of Control remains relatively calm. In the last 24 hours, the Pakistan Army resorted to intense & unprovoked firing with heavy caliber weapons in selected areas of Krishna Ghati and Sunderbani, targeting Indian posts & civilian areas with Mortar bombs & heavy Arty Guns. The same was effectively retaliated by the Indian Army. There have been no casualties on the Indian side.


    We would reiterate that as a professional Army we are committed to avoid civil casualties, especially along the Line of Control. All actions taken by our defence forces are targeted towards counter terrorism and terrorist infrastructure, away from civilian areas, to avoid civilian casualties.


    We are maintaining strict vigil along the Line of Control and IB. Any further provocation or misadventure by Pakistan will be responded in a befitting manner with dire consequences.


    Lt Col Mohit Vaishnava
