    Officer Trainees of the 72 nd batch of the Indian Revenue Service called on the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, today (March 8, 2019) at Rashtrapati Bhavan.


    Addressing the IRS Officer Trainees, the President said that India is the world’s fastest growing major economy. Over the coming decade, its GDP is expected to more than double. This will create more opportunities all-round. It will increase tax revenues and enhance challenges for Revenue Officers. They will need to address the challenges while facilitating the economic engine of our country.


    The President said that in recent years the government has taken several initiatives to clean our financial system and defeat the menace of black money. IRS officers are frontline soldiers in this battle. Steps such as demonetisation, the Income Declaration Scheme, and amendment to the Benami Transactions Prohibition Act have demonstrated the will of the people and the government to make our economy more transparent.


    The President said that common people have great expectations from our public servants and particularly from the IRS officers. They are one of the most important interfaces between the government and citizens. He advised them to never forget that it is from “We, the People” that they derive their power and authority to serve the very same people – the people of India.
