    The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today offered prayers, at Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi. He addressed the gathering at Kashi Vishwanath Temple, after a symbolic ground-breaking ceremony. He said that he is indeed blessed, to be associated with the project of Kashi Vishwanath Dham. He complimented the officers involved with the project, for performing their task with devotion. He thanked all the people who had property around the temple, and have allowed its acquisition for the project.


    He said the Kashi Vishwanath Temple has survived the vicissitudes of centuries. He recalled and praised Queen Ahiyabai Holkar for her work on the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, over two centuries ago.


    He said that since then, not much thought had been given by those in power, to the entire area around the Temple.


    He said about 40 Temples near the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, had been encroached over time, and have now been freed of that encroachment. He said the entire Temple complex is now in the process of rejuvenation, and the results are becoming visible. He said a direct link is being established between the River Ganga, and Kashi Vishwanath Temple.


    He said this project will become a model for similar projects elsewhere, and would give a new global identity to Kashi.
