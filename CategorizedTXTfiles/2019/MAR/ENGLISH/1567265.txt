    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, presented Colours to Air Force Station, Hakimpet, and 5 Base Repair Depot at the Air Force Station, Sulur, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, today (March 4, 2019).


    Speaking on the occasion, the President said that India’s growing stature in the comity of nations is consistent with the strength and capabilities of our armed forces. India remains firmly committed to peace, but in case the need arises, we will use all our might to protect the nation’s sovereignty. Our Armed Forces, exemplified by our air warriors reflect our firm resolve to defend our nation. Their valour and professionalism was on display very recently, as the Indian Air Force carried out pre-emptive strikes on a known terrorist camp.


    The President said that besides safeguarding the sovereign skies of our nation, the Indian Air Force has also been at the forefront of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) operations. The resilience and tenacity displayed by our valiant air warriors is a great source of pride for the nation.
