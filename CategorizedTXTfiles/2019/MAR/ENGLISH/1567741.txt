    Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Shipping and Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation Shri Nitin Gadkari received a report on Hybrid Simulation for Traffic Mapping and Modelling for easing traffic congestion in big cities. The objective of the study was to prepare Hybrid Model and utilize it for preparing and testing short term and long terms strategies/interventions to remove traffic congestion in Delhi. The scope of the model can be extended to the entire Delhi NCR region and similar models can be built for other major metropolitan cities of India. This model is also useful in understanding the impact assessments of various upcoming infrastructure projects like, roads, flyovers, underpasses and other rapid transit projects.


    The report has been prepared by a JV between Medulla Soft Technologies Private Limited-Transport Simulation Systems, Spain. The study, aimed at creating one of the most dynamic traffic models of the world with extremely high traffic density and more than 900 intersections, was awarded through Indian Academy of Highway Engineers - a subsidiary of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. The University of New South Wales, Sydney Australia through its Transport and Innovation Hub (Research Centre for Integrated Transport Innovation) played an advisory role in completion of the project.


    This model can help replace various traffic feasibility studies, demand assessments for individual projects etc. The model can be updated every two years with relevant traffic data so as to make it useful over the next coming years.
