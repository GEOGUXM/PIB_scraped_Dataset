    The National Film Archive of India and TIFA Working Studios are hosting a festival to celebrate Women in Transnational Cinema on 15th March, 2019 at NFAI, Pune.


    The festival will witness film screenings, presentations, a panel discussion, a multi-channel film installation and a Wikipedia edit-a-thon. The festival sheds light on under-represented moving image history and wants to initiate a revision of the established film canon. It wants to highlight the work of female film artists not only as directors and actors, but also as cinematographers, composers, editors, costume designers and so forth. A focal point will be on film form and aesthetics created around gender representation, womanhood and girlhood. The festival seeks to create a dialogue among national cinemas throughout film history.


    Screening Schedule:


      * Achhut Kannya (Franz Osten, 1936) at 4.15 PM


      * Subarnarekha (Ritwik Ghatak, 1965) at 6.30 PM


    The festival is free and open for all. For more information, contact contact@tifa.edu.in or 9623444433.
