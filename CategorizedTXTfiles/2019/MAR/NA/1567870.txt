    Speaking on the occasion, Dr Bhamre said, “I would like to apprise you that Ministry of Defence [in June] last year had mandated that Janaushadhi Kendras to be empanelled with ECHS as Authorised Local Chemist (ALC) which will benefit the provisioning of medicines at much cheaper rate vis-a-vis market rate.”


    It will also help the hospitals to procure bulk medicines for ECHS patients from the Janaushadhi Kendra as a registered vendor, leading to cost reduction in procurement of drugs through ECHS as well as DGLP funds. The speed of delivery will provide succour and greater satisfaction to veterans and their dependents.

    The Janaushadhi Kendras provide quality generic medicines at affordable costs for all. Presently there are 5,053 Janaushadhi Kendras in 652 districts providing quality generic medicines that are cheaper by 50-90 per cent as compared to average market price.
