    The Election Commission has instructed that the photograph of the candidate should be printed on the ballot paper which is inserted in the ballot unit of the Electronic Voting Machine as well as on the postal ballot papers. The candidates will have to submit recent stamp size photograph for printing on the ballot paper.


    It is to be noted that the format of nomination form normally provides a box in the nomination form itself for candidates to affix their recent photograph. Further, photograph is also required to be affixed on the affidavit in Form 26. In view of the amendments in the nomination form, the Commission has directed that the candidates will be asked to submit two identical photographs, one for the nomination form and another for the affidavit.
