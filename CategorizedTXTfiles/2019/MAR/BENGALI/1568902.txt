    In a 'Naval Aviation - Industry Interaction' organised by the Naval Liaison Cell (Barrackpore) in Kolkata today, representatives of industries in the region interacted with officers from the Indian Navy. With an aim to familiarise the industry with the naval organisation, procedures, policies and requirements, interaction was held with more than 100 firms. Apart from replying to queries raised by industrialists, Navy officials also provided contact details of nodal officers at various units to take matters forward.


    Presiding over the meet, Rear Admiral VM Doss, Assistant Chief of Naval Staff (Air Material) said, most defence components needs were being met by various foreign companies so far. However, under the Centreâ€™s 'Make in India' initiative, the defence forces have eased the procedures for Indian industrialists to supply their products and the opportunity is immense. Once they start manufacturing and supplying components to the defence forces, they will be able to export them as well, he said.


    On the potential of supplying to Navy, the Rear Admiral said, the number of warships and aircraft will increase leading to more requirement of components within the next ten years. A naval aviation indigenisation road map has also been prepared for next five years to indigenise over 550 components (flight critical and non-flight critical).The industries can be involved in upgradation, repair work or reverse engineering and may supply their products to various PSUs/Defence PSUs, Ordinance factories and R&D organisations, he also said.
