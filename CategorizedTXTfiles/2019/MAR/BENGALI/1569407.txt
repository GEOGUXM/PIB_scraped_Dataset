    Kolkata, 25 March 2019


    The Election Commission of India on Saturday (23.03.2019) has issued a notification related to broadcast in connection with General Elections to the 17 th Lok Sabha 2019 and State Legislative Assemblies of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim in 2019.


    In the notification, the Commission once again reiterated that the TV/Radio channels and cable networks/internet website/social media platforms should ensure that the contents of the programmes telecast/broadcast/ displayed by them during the period of 48 hours referred to in Section 126 do not contain any material, including views/appeals by panelists/participants that may be construed as promoting/prejudicing the prospect of any particular party or candidate(s) or influencing/affecting the result of the election. This shall, among other things include display of any opinion poll and of standard debates, analysis, visuals and sound-bytes. In this connection, Section 126A of the R.P. Act 1951 has also been stated since it prohibits conducts of Exit Poll and dissemination of its results during the period mentioned therein, i.e. the hour fixed for commencement of poll in the first phase and half an hour after the time fixed for close of poll for the last phase in all the States.


    This has been issued since sometimes allegations of violations of the provisions of the Section 126 of R.P. Act 1951 by TV Channels in the telecast of their panel discussions/debates and other news and current affairs programmes came up in the past. The Commission has clarified in the past that the said Section 126 prohibits displaying any election matter by means, inter alia, of television or similar apparatus, during the period of 48 hours ending with the hour fixed for conclusion of poll in a constituency. "Election matter" has been defined in that Section as any matter intended or calculated to influence or affect the result of an election. Violation of the aforesaid provisions of Section 126 is punishable with imprisonment upto a period of two years, or with fine or both.
