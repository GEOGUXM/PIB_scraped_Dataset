      Posted On: 27 JUN 2019 1:02PM by PIB Delhi


    As per Gazette Notification G.S.R. 1361(E), dated 02.11.2017, all vehicles under category M & N, sold after 1 st of December 2017 are required to be fitted with FASTag by the manufacturer of the vehicle or its authorized dealer. To make availability widespread and maximizing existing vehicles to affix FASTags, Government has made it mandatory to affix FASTag for issuance of National Permit (N/P). A wide number of banks (22 numbers) have been certified to issue FASTag across the country. Further, bank neutral FASTag “NHAI FASTag” have been launched for easy availability at petrol-pump and on e-commerce site Amazon. By adopting these measures, Government endeavours to increase penetration of FASTag substantially and moving towards 100% cashless.


    This information was given by the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Shri Nitin J Gadkari in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
