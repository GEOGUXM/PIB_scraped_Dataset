    Earlier, in order to spread awareness about its health and other benefits of practicing yoga, a special session for the family members was also arranged through Ms. Vandana Rawat, a Yoga teacher.


    The International Day of Yoga is being celebrated the world over to let people know that regular yoga practice will lead to better mental, physical, and intellectual health. Yoga is an ancient physical, mental and spiritual practice that originated in India. The word ‘yoga’ derives from Sanskrit and means to join or to unite, symbolizing the union of body and consciousness. In recognition of its universal appeal, on 11 December 2014, the United Nations proclaimed 21 June as the International Day of Yoga. The International Day of Yoga aims to raise awareness worldwide of the many benefits of practicing yoga.
