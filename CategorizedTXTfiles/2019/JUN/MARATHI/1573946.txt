    National Film Archive of India will be paying tribute to the stalwart artist Girish Karnad with the screening of his acclaimed films Ondanondu Kaladalli, Kanooru Heggadithi, Kaadu and Jabbar Patel’s Umbartha starring Karnad.


    Girish Karnad, an acknowledged multifaceted personality in Indian cinema, passed away on 10th June 2019 at the age of 81. In a career span of more than five decades, Karnad wore many hats; starting as a playwright, he excelled in several aspects of filmmaking including screenwriting, direction and acting. Karnad’s films brought ruralism, history and mythical pathos with contemporary themes.


    Ondanondu Kaladalli (1978), an epic film was Karnad’s tribute to Kurosawa’s samurai films. The film attempts to revive a South Indian martial arts technique which survives mainly in the Kerala-based form of Kalaripayattu. Noted for its cinematography and stunt sequences, the film won Best Kannada film Award at 26th National Award.


    Kanooru Heggadithi (1999) is noted as comeback film of Karnad into direction. It was another National Award winning film and was based on the novel "Kanooru Subbamma Heggadithi" by Kannada writer Kuvempu.


    Kaadu (1973) was the first solo directorial venture of Karnad. The film presents a violent rural drama about the rivalry between two villages, from the perspective of a young boy. The film is recognized as one of the earliest films in Kannada Parallel Cinema.


    Umbartha (1981), a landmark Marathi social realist film directed by Jabbar Patel, starred Girish Karnad and Smita Patil in the central roles. Renowned filmmaker Jabbar Patel himself will be present during the screening on Saturday and will introduce the film and share his thoughts and memories on the occasion.
