    While talking to the audience after the programme, the Union Minister emphasized the need for conservation of water, as mentioned by the Prime Minister in Mann Ki Baat.


    Prime Minister said in Mann Ki Baat today that “Water scarcity affects many parts of the country every year. You will be surprised that only 8% of the water received from rains in the entire year is harvested in our country. Just and just 8%! Now the time has come to find a solution to this problem. I believe, like the other problems on hand, we can also solve this predicament by the participation of the people, Janbhagidari and their power, Janshakti we are bound to find a solution through the strength, cooperation and resolution of one hundred and thirty crore citizens.”
