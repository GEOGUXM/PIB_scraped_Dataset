    RITES Limited will set up toilet complexes within the premises of 100 railway stations in West Bengal. Eastern Coalfields Ltd will provide fund for setting up these toilets in circulating area of various stations within the jurisdiction of Eastern Railways in the state. Thus, a tripartite ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ for this purpose was signed between Eastern Railways, Eastern Coalfields Ltd. and RITES, here today. Shri Anuj Mittal, Chief Planning & Design Engineer, Eastern Railways; Shri R K Srivstava, General Manager (Welfare and CSR) of Eastern Coalfields Limited and Shri P R Kumar, General Manager (Regional Project Office – North) of RITES Ltd. signed this tripartite MoU for spearheading efforts towards building a ‘Swacch Bharat’.


    Apart from serving the passengers and railway staff, these toilet complexes would also come handy for numerous people who run small shops and stalls and make a living in the vicinity of railway stations. Each toilet complex will consist of two toilets for men, two for women and one for divyangs which are to be cost-free. This apart, the toilets will have sanitary napkin and condom vending machines and incinerators. Two such toilet complexes have already been started at Anand Vihar in Delhi and Prayagraj stations, informed Shri P R Kumar of RITES Ltd.


    Shri S S Gehlot, Additional General Manager of Eastern Railways was present at the MoU signing today.
