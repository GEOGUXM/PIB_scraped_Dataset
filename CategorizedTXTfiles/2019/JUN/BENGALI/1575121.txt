    The Income Tax Settlement Commission is a premier Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) body in the country. The ITSC is mandated with resolving income tax and wealth tax disputes between the Income Tax department and income tax assessees, stated Shri Mohammad Ashraf, Vice Chairman, ITSC, Kolkata Bench here today. Speaking at an interactive session on "Income Tax Settlement Commission-Current Scenario" organized by Calcutta Chamber of Commerce, Shri Ashraf and Shri B. D. Gupta, Member, ITSC said that it was setup to allow a one-time tax evader or an unintending defaulter to come clean. The Income Tax Settlement Commision allows taxpayers to disclose additional Income before it over and above what has been already disclosed before the Income Tax Department. The applicant has to pay full amount of tax and interest on the additional income disclosed before the Commission, before filing the application. The Commission then decides upon the admissibility of the application and in case of admitted applications, carries out the process of settlement in a time bound manner by giving an opportunity to both parties for being heard, they added.


    The Income Tax Settlement Commission is required to pass the settlement order within 18 months of filling of the application. It has wide power of granting immunity from penalty and prosecution for the income tax assessee. Shri Gupta informed and added that the orders passed by the Commission are final and conclusive.


    Shri Vasudev Agarwal, President, ACAE; Shri Jinesh S. Vanzara, Sr. Chartered Accountant and Shri Om Prakash Agarwal, President, CCC were also present on the occasion.
