      Posted On: 11 JUN 2019 5:07PM by PIB Thiruvananthpuram


    A two-day marine familiarisation programme was organised for a batch of 178 Coastal Wardens, recruited from the fisherman community across Kerala, by Southern Naval Command (SNC) at Naval base, Kochi on 10 and 11 Jun 19. During the programme the recruits were given an insight into nautical subjects such as survival at sea, rope work, boat handling and navigation at Seamanship School. They were introduced to various systems fitted at Joint Operation Centre (Kochi), for monitoring coastal security along the Kerala coast.


    The trainees were briefed on threats from the sea and the importance of Coastal Security. They were also explained various procedures to be followed on detecting a security threat at sea, or when faced with a life-threatening situation. The trainees were also shown around the Fast Interceptor Craft (FIC) of Sagar Prahari Bal (Kochi) â€“ a unit of the Navy which carries out round the clock patrolling of the coastline to guard against any security threat and is also part of search and rescue operations in times of emergency. The familiarisation programme for these 178 Coastal Wardens was part of their curriculum at the Kerala Police Academy, Thrissur where they are undergoing training to strengthen coastal security and to equip them for effective lifesaving at sea.
