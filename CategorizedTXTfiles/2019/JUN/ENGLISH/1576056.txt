      Drive to rescue Missing Children
      Posted On: 27 JUN 2019 5:47PM by PIB Delhi


    The Ministry of Women and Child Development has developed web portals “TrackChild” and “Khoya-Paya” to track the missing and found children. The TrackChild Portal is implemented in association with various stakeholders including Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Ministry of Railways, State Governments/UT Administrations, Child Welfare Committees, Juvenile Justice Boards and National Legal Services Authority. The “Khoya-Paya” has been integrated as a citizen corner on TrackChild portal.


    In addition, Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) has been prepared for tracing the missing children, and has been circulated to all States and UTs for further dissemination to all other stake holders such as Police and Child Welfare Committees (CWCs) Juvenile Justice Baoards (JJBs). This SOP lays down the uniform guidelines for expediting the search and rehabilitation of a missing child all over the country. The drive to rescue missing children at major Railway Stations is available through a dedicated toll free number, 1098 which is a 24X7 Child Helpline called Childline. It can be accessed by children in crisis or by adults on their behalf from any place in the geographical location of India.


    Further Ministry is also collobarating with Ministry of Railways to rescue and rehabilitate children in difficult circumstances who come in contact with Railways by setting up child help desks at Railway platforms. These Child help Desks are being manned by Childline partners at the Railway Stations.


    Currently, Child Help Desk (CHD) has been set up at 97 major Railway Stations. The details regarding children in contact with Railways in major railway stations who have been provided services during the last three years is given below:
