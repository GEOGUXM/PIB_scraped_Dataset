D and Post-Doctoral research programmes.A list indicating subjects/ courses of study which will qualify for consideration for award of scholarship is at Annexure-I .The prescribed financial assistance shall be provided till completion of the course/ research or the following period, whichever is earlier: -


     1. Post-Doctoral Research - 1& 1/2 years (One and a half year)


    (ii) Ph.D. - 4 years (four years)


    (iii) Master’s Degree -1/2/3 years (One/Two/three years) depending upon the duration of the Course.


    The extension of stay beyond prescribed period for levels of courses as mentioned above, may be considered without financial assistance of any kind except the air passage to return to India, if and only if recommendation of the competent concerned authority in the educational institution/ university as well as the Indian Mission abroad is received certifying that such an overstay for a specified period, is absolutely essential for facilitating the candidate to complete the course.
