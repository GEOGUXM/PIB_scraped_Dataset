    The Menstrual Hygiene Scheme of the Health Ministry encompasses the following:

      * Increasing awareness among adolescent girls on menstrual hygiene.
      * Improve access to and use of high quality sanitary napkins by adolescent girls primarily in rural areas.
      * Ensuring safe disposal of sanitary napkins in an environmentally friendly manner.
      * Provision of funds to ASHAs to hold monthly meetings in Anganwadicentres or similar platforms with adolescents to discuss issues related to menstrual hygiene.
      * ASHAs across the country are trained and play a significant role in promotion of use and distribution of sanitary napkins. She receives an incentive @Rs 1 per pack sold and a free pack of napkins every month for her own personal use.

    A range of IEC material has been developed around maintenance of good menstrual health, using 360 degree approach to create awareness among adolescent girls about safe and hygienic menstrual health practices. This includes mass and mid media coverage by audio clips and videosalong with reading material for adolescent girls and job-aids for ASHAs and other field level functionaries for communicating with adolescent girls.
