      Posted On: 27 JUN 2019 5:43PM by PIB Delhi


    The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) Scheme aims to address the critical issue of declining Child Sex Ratio (CSR). The specific objectives of the scheme are:

     1. prevent gender biased sex selective elimination
     2. ensure survival and protection of the girl child
     3. ensure education and participation of the girl child through coordinated and convergent efforts.

    Out of 640 districts (as per Census 2011), 405 districts are selected under Multi-sectoral intervention and advocacy & media campaign, while remaining 235 districts are covered under advocacy & media campaign only.


    BBBP scheme has provision for awards and recognitions but no provision for direct individual cash transfer for any strata of society including daughters of poor women. It is not a DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) scheme. Under the scheme, combined data of urban and rural areas are considered for the Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB).


    The latest reports of Health Management Information System (HMIS) of Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW) for the time period between F.Y. 2015-16 and F.Y. 2018-19, reveal that SRB is showing improving trends from 923 to 931, which include urban areas as well as rural areas of the country.


    This information was given by the Minister of Women and Child Development, Smriti Zubin Irani, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
