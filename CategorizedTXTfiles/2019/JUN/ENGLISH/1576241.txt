      Posted On: 28 JUN 2019 5:54PM by PIB Delhi


    There is no specific scheme of the Government to promote organized farming. However, the Government is promoting contract farming and formation of Farmer Producer Organization (FPOs) in order to promote farming in organized manner.


    The Government of India, through Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC), has been promoting formation of FPOs with technical handholding and financial support to leverage the collectivization from pre-production to post-harvest marketing.


    The Government has formulated and released the progressive and facilitative Model Act “The ---State /UT Agricultural Produce & Livestock Contract farming and Services (Promotion & facilitation ) Act, 2018” in May, 2018 for its adoption by the States/Union Territories (UTs). The aforesaid Model Contract Farming Act provides that Farmer Producer Organisation (FPO) may enter into agreement with the contract farming sponsor to draw all the benefits of contract farming all long the agri-food value chain. Self Help Groups (SHGs) as part of FPOs can avail the benefits.


    This Information was given by the Union Minister for Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Shri Narendra Singh Tomar in Rajya Sabha today.
