      Depression over Eastcentral and adjoining Southeast Arabian Sea & Lakshadweep area: Pre- Cyclone Watch for Gujarat Coast
      Posted On: 10 JUN 2019 1:06PM by PIB Delhi


      The depression over Southeast and adjoining Lakshadweep & Eastcentral Arabian Sea moved northwards with a speed of about 31 kmph in last three hours and lay centred at 0830 hrs IST of today, the 10 th June, 2019 near latitude 12.5°N and longitude 71.0°E over Eastcentral and adjoining Southeast Arabian Sea & Lakshadweep area, about 240 km northwest of Aminidivi (Lakshadweep), 760 km south-southwest of Mumbai (Maharashtra) and 930 km south-southeast of Veraval (Gujarat). It is very likely to intensify further into a deep depression during next 06 hours, into a Cyclonic Storm during the subsequent 24 hours and into a Severe Cyclonic Storm thereafter. It is likely to move north-northwestwards during next 72 hours.


      It is very likely to cause adverse impact in terms of wind & rainfall over Saurashtra & Kutch mainly on 13th & 14th June, 2019.


      Forecast track and intensity are given in the following table:
