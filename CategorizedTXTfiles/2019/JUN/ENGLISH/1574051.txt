      VAYU to cross Gujarat coast between Dwarka and Veraval around afternoon of 13th June
      Posted On: 12 JUN 2019 6:18PM by PIB Delhi


    The Very Severe Cyclonic Storm ‘VAYU’ (pronounced as VAA’YU ) over Eastcentral Arabian Sea moved north-northwestwards with a speed of about 16 kmph in last six hours and lay centred at 1430 hrs IST of 12 th June, 2019 near latitude 18.8°N and longitude 69.9°E over Eastcentral Arabian Sea, about 310 km nearly west of Mumbai (Maharashtra), 230 km south-southwest of Veraval (Gujarat) and 310 km nearly south of Porbandar (Gujarat).


    It is very likely to move nearly northwards and cross Gujarat coast between Dwarka and Veraval as a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm with wind speed 155-165 kmph gusting to 180 kmph around afternoon of 13th June 2019.


    After crossing, the system is likely to move along & parallel to Saurashtra & Kutch Coast affecting Amreli, Gir Somnath, Diu, Junagarh, Porbandar, Rajkot, Jamnagar, Devbhoomi Dwarka and Kutch.
