    The Programme aims to integrate cross-country experiences and best practices in field administration. It is led by the Ministry of External Affairs, Govt. of India.


    To set the tone of the interaction, NDMA made a presentation on the global trends in disasters, the institutional mechanism for Disaster Risk Reduction in India and the functioning of the Authority. This was followed by a detailed discussion on relevant issues.


    Knowledge exchange and sharing of best practices is an important tool for reducing risks and empowering vulnerable communities. Discussions at the meeting would mutually benefit both the countries in their efforts towards Disaster Risk Reduction.
