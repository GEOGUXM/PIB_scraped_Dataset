      Posted On: 27 JUN 2019 2:29PM by PIB Delhi


    There is an increase of Rs. 26.00 crore in the budgetary allocation for incentives to sportspersons. In the Interim budget this year, the allocation is Rs. 87.00 crore as compared to Rs. 61.00 crore in the previous year.


    All eligible sportspersons are being provided cash awards, meritorious pension as per existing policy and guidelines. In view of inadequate provisions last year money for distributing cash awards to medal winners was borrowed from the National Sports Development Fund and the same would be reimbursed out of allocation of the current year.


    While augmentation of sports infrastructure / sports facilities for high performance at international arena is a continuing process , the extant infrastructure, facilities and incentives being provided by the Central Government have been motivating sportspersons to excel in international sports competitions.


    This Information was given by the Minister of State (I/C) Shri Kiren Rijiju in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
