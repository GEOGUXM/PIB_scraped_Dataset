      Posted On: 25 JUN 2019 6:33PM by PIB Delhi


    The Basic Savings Bank Deposit (BSBD) Accounts are designed as savings accounts, which offer certain minimum facilities free of charge. There is no requirement of maintaining a minimum balance in such accounts.


    Individual Public Sector Banks (PSBs) have their own helpline/toll free numbers. Most of these banks are providing accounts related information, including the nature of accounts through this facility. Besides, the type of account is also printed on the passbook provided by some banks to their customers. The customer can also view the details of the account using Internet Banking Facility.


    The Government, as such, does not maintain any helpline number or any other source to inform customers of individual banks about their account details.


    This was stated by the Union Minister of Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharamanin a written reply to a Parliament Question in Rajya Sabha today.
