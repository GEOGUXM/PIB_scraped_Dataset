      Posted On: 25 JUN 2019 12:55PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government has constituted a Commission on 2 nd October, 2017 under article 340 of the Constitution to examine the issues of the sub-categorization of Other Backward Classes with the following terms of reference:

     1. To examine the extent of inequitable distribution of benefits of reservation among the castes or communities included in the broad category of Other Backward Classes with reference to such classes included in the Central List;
     2. To work out the mechanism, criteria, norms and parameters in a scientific approach for sub-categorisation within such Other Backward Classes; and
     3. To take up the exercise of identifying the respective castes or communities or sub-castes or synonyms in the Central List of Other Backward Classes and classifying them into their respective sub-categories.

    The Commission has not submitted its report to the Government. The four-member Commission headed by Justice (Retd.) G. Rohini, Chief Justice (Retd.), Delhi High Court was to submit its report in twelve weeks time from the date of assumption of charge by the Chairperson. However, the Commission expressed the need for obtaining the caste-wise data for which additional time was required. Therefore, the tenure of the Commission has been extended by the Government from time to time. At present the term of the Commission was extended for the sixth time up to 31.07.2019.


    This information was given by Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Shri Krishan Pal Gurjar in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
