      Distribution under PDS
      Posted On: 25 JUN 2019 4:29PM by PIB Delhi


    Under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA), the eligible households are entitled to receive foodgrains, namely- Wheat, Rice & Coarse-grains through Public Distribution System (PDS). As per entitlements under the Act, the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households are eligible to receive 35 kg of foodgrains per family per month, whereas the Priority Households (PHH) beneficiaries are eligible to receive 5 kg of foodgrains per person per month.


    Distribution of subsidized sugar of 1 Kg per AAY family per month is also continued under PDS.


    Further, clause 9(9) of Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) (Control) Order, 2015, empowers the State/UT Governments to allow sale of commodities other than distribution of foodgrains through Fair Price Shops to improve the viability of the fair price shop operations.


    As per the information received from States/UTs upto 22.05.2019 a Statement indicating State-wise total No. of ration cardholders is at Annex-I.


    Few complaints about foodgrains and other commodities not being given to the consumers in full quantity from Government ration shops under PDS have come to the notice of the Government in some State/UTs. Therefore, as and when such complaints are received by the Government, these are referred to the concerned State/UT Governments for inquiry and appropriate action.


    Under the PDS, the distribution of cereals and other commodities is presently being done as per the details furnished under part (a) above.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri Ram Vilas Paswan in Lok Sabha today.
