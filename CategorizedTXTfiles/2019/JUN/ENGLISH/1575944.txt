    NHs are designed and constructed as per Indian Roads Congress Codes and the Ministryâ€™s relevant Guidelines / Policies. Road Safety measures and provisions are part of the design and construction of NHs. Road Safety audits are also carried out as part of NH development projects on Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) / Build Operate Transfer (BOT) modes. Identification and rectification of road accident black spots, improvements on safety on NHs through Road Safety Annual Plan, taking up of Road Safety audits, installation of crash barriers at accident prone locations in Hilly terrain etc, are taken up to minimize accidents on NHs.


    Safety of Road Construction Workers and Environmental Protection are also part of design and construction of NHs and these are implemented as per the relevant policies / guidelines and provisions of the Contract / Concession Agreements.


    The Ministry has promulgated the Green Highways (Plantation, Transplantation, Beautification & Maintenance) Policy, 2015 with regard to planting of trees in place of trees cut due to widening of NHs as per the Statutory conditions by different agencies. Planting of trees in lieu of the cut trees is generally done after substantial completion of Civil construction works to avoid damage to the planted saplings. Like tree cutting, planting is done by different agencies, including the Forest Department, depending upon the requirements of individual project and contractual conditions.


    This information was given by the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Shri Nitin J Gadkari in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
