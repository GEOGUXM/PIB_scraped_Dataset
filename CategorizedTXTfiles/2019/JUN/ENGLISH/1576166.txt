      Minimum Support Price (MSP) FOR MILK
      Posted On: 28 JUN 2019 4:04PM by PIB Delhi


    This Department does not regulate the prices of milk in the country. Prices are decided by the Cooperative and Private dairies based on cost of production. Since milk is a highly perishable product, this department does not have any proposal to fix MSP for milk in the country.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Balyan in Rajya Sabha today.
