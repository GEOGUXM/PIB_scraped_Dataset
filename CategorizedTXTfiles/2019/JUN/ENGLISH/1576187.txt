      India Newborn Action Plan (INAP) was launched in 2014 to make concerted efforts towards attainment of the goals of “Single Digit Neonatal Mortality Rate” and “Single Digit Still birth Rate,” by 2030. Comprehensive Lactation Management Centres (CLMCs) at facilities with SNCU and Lactation Management Units (LMUs) at Sub-district level are made functional to ensure availability of Human Milk for feeding small newborns. Home Based Newborn Care (HBNC) and Home Based Care of Young Children (HBYC) are provided by ASHAs to improve child rearing practices.


      Early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding for first six months and appropriate Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices are promoted in convergence with Ministry of Women and Child Development.

      Universal screening of pregnant women including anaemic pregnant women is carried out at all public health facilities and 180 iron & folic acid (IFA) tablets are given in the antenatal and 180 IFA tablets are given in the post-natal period to all pregnant women. Double doses tablets are given as a part of treatment regimen to those found to be clinically anaemic.

      Nutrition Rehabilitation Centres (NRCs) have been set up at public health facilities to treat and manage the children with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) admitted with medical complications.


      Iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation for the prevention of anemia among the vulnerable age groups, home visits by ASHAs to promote exclusive breast feeding and promote use of ORS and Zinc for management of diarrhoea in children under Intensified Diarrhoea Control Fortnight (IDCF), administration of de-worming tablets to all the children in the age group of 1-19 years during National De-worming Day (February and August) are carried out.
