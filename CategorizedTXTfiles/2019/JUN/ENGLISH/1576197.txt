      Posted On: 28 JUN 2019 4:42PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government of India is implementing One Stop Centre (OSC) scheme for setting up One Stop Centre since 1 st April 2015 to support women affected by violence. In Bihar, 38 OSCs have been sanctioned for in a phased manner during the financial years 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2018-19.


    During the year 2017-18, no fund was released, however, the fund released in the previous year was revalidated for utilisation during the year 2017-18. Further, during 2018-19, Rs.308.32 lakh was released to the districts of Bihar by the Government of India. These funds have been released to the districts of Bihar for running of the OSCs by setting them up in pre-existing buildings as well as for construction of new buildings for OSCs as per the provisions of the OSC Scheme. Since the OSC Scheme is an ongoing scheme, all unutilised funds are available with the State Government/ District Authorities for its implementation. Directions have been issued from time to time for speedy implementation of the OSC scheme and proper utilisation of its funds. Presently 38 OSCs are operational in all the districts of Bihar is given below:
