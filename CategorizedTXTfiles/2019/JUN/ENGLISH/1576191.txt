    The beneficiaries under the Anganwadi Services Scheme are identified on the basis of Aadhaar which is used as identity document for delivery of services or benefits which brings in transparency and efficiency and enables beneficiaries to get their entitlements.


    The beneficiaries not possessing Aadhar card are assisted by the field functionaries to obtain the Aadhar card. Till such time they get the Adhaar card, they are provided the Anganwadi Services on the basis of alternative identification document. This is an important tool to eliminate fake beneficiaries, if any, and it is an ongoing exercise. It is applicable to all the States/UTs including Kerala.


    This information was given by the Minister of Women and Child Development, Smriti Zubin Irani, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
