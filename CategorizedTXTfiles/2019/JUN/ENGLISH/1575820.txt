    Indian cashew industry is heavily dependent on the imported raw cashew nuts (about 50% of requirement) for fulfilling domestic and export demand for cashew kernels. Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), under Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), has drawn up strategies to increase domestic production by massive area expansion of cashew and replacing of senile cashew plantations with high yielding varieties in traditional and non-traditional states. DAC&FW has approved the roadmap programme of Directorate of Cashew nut & Cocoa Development (DCCD) to extend the area of cashew cultivation by 1.20 lakh hectare. Production of raw cashew nut during 2017-18 has increased by 4.83 % to 8,17,045 Metric Tons as compared to production of 7,79,335 Metric Tons during 2016-17 and 21.89% increase compared to the production of 6,70,300 Metric Tons during 2015-16.
