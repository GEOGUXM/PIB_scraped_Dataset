    Pro-jihadi books, publications besides pamphlets, magazines and posters published by the proscribed organization SIMI and various incriminating documents/literature related to IS have been recovered from arrested persons.


    A multi-pronged strategy has been adopted to check the Islamic State (IS) and to bring back the misguided youth on the right path. The measures include socio-economic development of vulnerable communities and focus on educational empowerment. As IS uses various internet based social media


    platforms to propagate its ideology, the agencies concerned closely watch Cyber space and take action as per law. Counselling of radicalised individuals has been undertaken with the involvement of families.


    Besides, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the States Police have registered cases against IS members/sympathizers. The Islamic State (IS)/ Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL)/ Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)/ Daesh has been notified as a Terrorist Organization and included in the First Schedule to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 by the Central Government.
