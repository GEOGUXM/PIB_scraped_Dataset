      Posted On: 21 JUN 2019 6:02PM by PIB Delhi


    The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, through Mahalanobis National Crop Forecast Centre (MNCFC) has involved 8 agencies/ organizations to carry out pilot studies for Optimization of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) in various States including Andhra Pradesh under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY).


    During Kharif 2018, the Pilot Study was conducted for paddy crop in West Godavari district and during Rabi 2018-19, the study is being conducted in East Godavari and Krishna districts. The studies used various technologies, including Satellite data, Artificial Intelligence, Modeling tools etc. for reducing the number of CCEs required for insurance unit level for yield estimation. The studies have showed the possibility of reducing the number of CCEs up to 25-70% (depending upon crops and location), through the use of technology.


    Carrying out large number of CCEs for calculation of yield data vis-à-vis claims at Gram Panchayat level is a major issue under PMFBY. A High Power Committee has been constituted to evaluate results obtained in these studies and provide recommendations for their implementation in the upcoming seasons.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar in Rajya Sabha today.
