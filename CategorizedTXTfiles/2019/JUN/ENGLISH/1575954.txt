    The Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Nityanand Rai called on the Vice President of India, Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu, here today.


    During the interaction, the Vice President advised Shri Rai to expedite the completion of the Southern Campus building of the National Institute of Disaster Management at Kondapavuluru village in Krishna District, which is coming up on a 10-acre site. The foundation stone for the building was laid by the Vice President on May 22, 2018 in the presence of the then Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju.


    An interim setup of NIDM southern campus is currently operating in the campus of Andhra Pradesh Human Resource Development Institute at Bapatla.


    In view of the vulnerability of the coastal districts to frequent cyclones and natural calamities like floods, the Vice President advised the Minister to enhance capacity building, organize training programs in disaster preparedness and management.


    The southern campus aims at ground level issues, local planning, last mile connectivity and mainstreaming disaster management into Sustainable Development Goals through its training and capacity building.


    The geography of South India plays a vital role in designing the institute’s programs with special emphasis on disasters specific to Southern states.


    The Minister of State for Jal Shakti and Social Justice and Empowerment, Shri Rattan Lal Kataria and the Minister of State for Women and Child Development, Sushri Deboshree Choudhary also called on the Vice President and informed him about their respective departmental programs and activities undertaken by their Ministries.
