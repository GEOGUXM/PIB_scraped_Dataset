The Hon’ble Prime Minister shared the idea of youth becoming the voice of India in his ‘Mann ki Baat’ on 31 st December, 2017 and also reiterated his desire to organise the Youth Parliament in his address during inauguration of the 22 nd National Youth Festival on 12 th January, 2018. Accordingly, in the year 2019, the National Youth Festival was merged with National Youth Parliament Festival and was organised from 12 th January to 27 th February, 2019 with an objective to hear the voice of youth, to encourage the youth to engage with public issues, understand the common man’s point of view, form opinion and express it in an articulate manner and to develop and enhance decision making abilities. The National Youth Parliament Festival was inaugurated by the then Hon’ble MoS(IC) Col. Rajyavardhan Rathore (Retd.) on 12 th January, 2019. The festival was conducted at National, State and District level wherein about 88,000 youths were heard through walk in and digital screening. 56 finalists were heard by a panel of eminent jury members in final round held on 26 th February, 2019 at Dr. B.
