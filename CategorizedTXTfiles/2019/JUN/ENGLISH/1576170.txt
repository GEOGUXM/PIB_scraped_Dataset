      Action on Complaints regarding TPDS
      Posted On: 28 JUN 2019 4:11PM by PIB Delhi


    There have been complaints about irregularities in the functioning of the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) including leakage/diversion of foodgrains, foodgrains not reaching the intended beneficiaries, issuance of ration cards to ineligible persons, etc. in some States/regions in the country. TPDS is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and the State/Union Territory (UT) Governments wherein the operational responsibilities for implementation of TPDS within the State/UT rest with the State/UT Governments concerned. Therefore, as and when complaints are received by the Government from individuals and organizations as well as through press reports, they are sent to State/UT Governments concerned for inquiry and appropriate action. A State/UT-wise statement indicating number of such complaints received during the last three years is at Annex.


    An offence committed in violation of the provisions of TPDS (C) Order, 2015 is liable for penal action under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. Thus, the Order empowers State/UT Governments to take punitive action in case of contravention of relevant provisions of these Orders.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution , Shri. Danve Raosaheb Dadarao in the Rajya Sabha today.
