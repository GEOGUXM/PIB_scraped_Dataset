      Terrorist Activities
      Posted On: 25 JUN 2019 3:54PM by PIB Delhi


    Terrorist activities have reduced significantly in the Hinterland of the country. Similarly, terrorist incidents have reduced in North Eastern States and also in Left Wing Extremism affected areas. In Jammu & Kashmir, security forces are proactively engaging with terrorists as per the Government policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism, resulting in neutralization of large number of terrorists and causalities to Security Forces. The details of the terrorist/insurgent/extremist incidents that have taken place in the country during the last five years, along with number of security personnel / civilians killed are at Annexure.


    Close and effective coordination between intelligence and security agencies at the Centre and the State level is being maintained in order to avert terror incidents in the country. The Multi Agency Centre (MAC) has been strengthened and re-organized to enable it to function on 24x7 basis for real time collation and sharing of intelligence with other Agencies and State Governments. With a view to enhance the capacity of State forces, the Central Agencies have been organising training programmes for the States forces on intelligence sharing and investigation of terrorism cases. Many States have raised special forces to deal with terrorism. Central Armed Police Forces and National Security Guards have also been stationed at different locations to assist the States in dealing with such incidents.


    As far as Jammu & Kashmir is concerned, the Government regularly reviews the security situation. In order to combat activities of terrorists, several steps have been taken including strengthening operational grid, enhancing coordination amongst security agencies, effective retaliation of terror acts, etc. The Government has implemented a number of measures to mainstream the youth, including providing employment opportunities, sports and cultural activities and youth exchange programme. Development activities are also being undertaken under Prime Minister Development Package, 2015.


    As per available information, these two organisations have released a report on human rights violation in Kashmir. The organisations are known to present a malicious and biased view, while ignoring facts and ground realities in the State.
