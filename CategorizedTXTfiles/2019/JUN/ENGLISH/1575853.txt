    This Ministry has launched a new regular employment-unemployment survey, namely, Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) during April, 2017 with certain changes in survey methodology, data collection mechanism and sampling design vis-à-vis the earlier quinquennial (once in every five years) Employment and Unemployment surveys of NSSO. The PLFS has been launched with an objective of measuring quarterly changes of various labour market statistical indicators in urban areas as well as generating annual estimates of these indicators both for rural and urban areas, which can be used for policy making.


    The unemployment rates in usual status separately for males and females in rural and urban areas as per the Annual Report on PLFS (July, 2017- June, 2018) are as under:

         
All-India
