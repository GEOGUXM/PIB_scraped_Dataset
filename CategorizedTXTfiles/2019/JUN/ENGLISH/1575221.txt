      Posted On: 21 JUN 2019 5:09PM by PIB Delhi


    During the year 2019-20, as on 16.06.19, buffer of around 44,205 MT of onions has been built through procurement from crop of Rabi-2019 season as against a buffer of 13,508 MT built in 2018-19.


    Stock limits on onions is periodically reviewed keeping in view the price and availability situation. The stock limit on onion was withdrawn on 31 st March, 2018 in view of the market scenario. Onion from the buffer was released during lean periods of 2017-18 & 2018-19 to moderate the prices and disincentivize hoarding. The Central Government has offered onions from the buffer to States/UTs at no profit no loss basis to improve availability and moderate prices of onion during lean season.
