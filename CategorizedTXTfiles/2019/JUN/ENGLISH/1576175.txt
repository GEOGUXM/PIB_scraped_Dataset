      Posted On: 28 JUN 2019 4:16PM by PIB Delhi


    Department of food while in view of the fact that some of the beneficiaries may be experiencing difficulty in getting their entitled foodgrains because of their inability to visit the Fair Price Shop (FPS) themselves for reasons such as old age (above 65 years), physical disability, etc. has issued instructions to all States/UTs for special dispensation of foodgrains. Further, in this regard no objection has been received from any State/UT by the Department.


    Public Distribution System (PDS) is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and State/UT Governments. Central Govt. is responsible for procurement, allocation and transportation of foodgrains upto the designated depots of the FCI. The operational responsibilities for identification of eligible beneficiaries/families, issuance of ration cards to them and maintenance of all record s relating to beneficiaries and distribution of foodgrains, etc. rest with the concerned State/UT Government.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri. Danve Raosaheb Dadarao in the Rajya Sabha today.
