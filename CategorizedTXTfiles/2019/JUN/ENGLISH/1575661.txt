    The Swadesh Darshan and PRASHAD Schemes Guidelines have provision for developing nature and environment friendly destinations for both global and domestic tourists. The Ministry has made it mandatory for the State Governments/UT Administrations to prepare the Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) involving eco-tourism aspects viz. use of clean/renewable energy; eco-friendly materials and equipment, recycling & reuse while submitting proposals under the PRASHAD and the Swadesh Darshan Schemes.


    Ministry of Tourism is regularly promoting adventure tourism, religious tourism and eco-tourism as part of Incredible India 2.0 Campaign in domestic and overseas markets. Ministry of Tourism is also releasing specific media campaigns for promoting tourism destinations in North East States. North Eastern States are also being showcased on the Incredible India website. These destinations and niche tourism products are also being promoted on regular basis by India tourism offices in exhibitions and fairs held in India and abroad.
