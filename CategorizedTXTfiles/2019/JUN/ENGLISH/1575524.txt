    The scheme of Mechanism for Marketing of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) through Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Development of Value Chain for MFP covers various activities including procurement of MFPs when their market price falls below their notified MSP, setting up/expansion of storage facilities, expanding the knowledge base on MFP, training for sustainable collection, value addition, etc. The activities involving expanding knowledge base, training for sustainable collection, value addition, etc. are done through by the Ministry and the Central Government bears 100% of the expenditure incurred for these activities.


    While there is no proposal to introduce a separate scheme/policy on this matter, Ministry of Tribal Affairs desired to brand the activities being undertaken by it under the existing scheme of Mechanism for Marketing of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) through Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Development of Value Chain for MFP as “Van Dhan Vikas Karyakram”.
