      Posted On: 27 JUN 2019 1:01PM by PIB Delhi


    The Government vide, G.S.R 490(E) dated 24.05.2018 has notified mass emission standards for flex-fuel Methanol M15 or M100 and Methanol MD 95 vehicles. M-15 is a blend of 15 % methanol and 85 % Gasoline. Use of blended fuel M-15 in BS-IV cars can result in lowering down greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by about 5 to 10 percent thereby improving air quality. M-15 fuel blending is available as an option and there is no proposal to make such blending mandatory in the near future.


    This information was given by the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Shri Nitin J Gadkari in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
