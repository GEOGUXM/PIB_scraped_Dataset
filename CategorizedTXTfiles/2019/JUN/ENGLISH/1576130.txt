    Giving a written reply to a separate question on capping prices of cancer drugs, in Rajya Sabha today, Shri Gowda stated that NPPA has put a cap on Trade Margin of 42 select non-scheduled anti-cancer medicines under ‘Trade Margin Rationalisation’ Approach, w.e.f. 27 th February, 2019. By this approach, the MRP of 526 brands of these medicines have been reduced by up to 90%. This move will result in an approximately annual savings of around Rs. 984 crore to the patients, the Minister added.
