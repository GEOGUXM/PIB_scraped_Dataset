    As per latest available Annual Report 2016-17 and 2017-18 of Ministry of Home Affairs, the foreign contribution of over Rs. 15 thousand crore was received in the year 2016-17, as against over Rs. 20 thousand crore in year 2015-16, under Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 (FCRA, 2010). No reason has been stated for the decline in the foreign contribution in the Report.


    The Government and Reserve Bank of India are closely monitoring the emerging external position including exchange rate of the rupee on an on-going basis and are calibrating policies or regulations to support robust macroeconomic outcome.


    This was stated by the Union Minister of Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in a written reply to a Parliament Question in Rajya Sabha today.
