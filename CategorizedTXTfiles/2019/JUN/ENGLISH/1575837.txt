    Receipt of proposals for electrification of Railway lines from various States is a continuous process. Ministry of Railways has planned to electrify balance Broad Gauge routes of Indian Railways encompassing all the States. Balance route electrification work have already been sanctioned.


    No new infrastructure for production of Diesel Locomotives has been proposed by Railways after the decision of 100% electrification in September, 2018. Diesel locomotives that will be manufactured at Diesel Locomotive Factory Marhowra shall be required by Indian Railways for strategic, emergency and certain operational reasons.


    This information was given by the Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
