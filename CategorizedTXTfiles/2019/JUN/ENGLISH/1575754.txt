      Posted On: 26 JUN 2019 3:40PM by PIB Delhi


    Incidents of misuse of social media to commit cyber crimes including online abuse and stalking of women are reported. “Police” and “Public Order” are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibility to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of citizens rests primarily with the respective State Government/ Union Territory. The State Governments/ Union Territories are competent to deal with cases of misuse of social media to commit cyber crimes.


    Ministry of Home Affairs is implementing a scheme namely Cyber Crime Prevention against Women and Children (CCPWC) under which an online cybercrime reporting portal, ( www.cybercrime.gov.in ) has been launched in September, 2018 to enable public to report complaints pertaining to Child


    Pornography/Child Sexual Abuse Material, rape/gang rape imageries or sexually explicit content. The Portal facilitates the States/UTs to view complaints of cyber crime online and take appropriate action. Since inception of the portal, more than 16000 complaints, including other cyber crimes, have been received through this Portal, till 15.06.2019 for action by the States/ UTs concerned. Steps have also been taken to spread awareness, issue of alerts/advisories, training of law enforcement agencies, improving cyber forensics facilities , etc. These steps help to prevent such cases and speed up investigation.


    This was stated by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri G. Kishan Reddy in a written reply to question in the Rajya Sabha today.
