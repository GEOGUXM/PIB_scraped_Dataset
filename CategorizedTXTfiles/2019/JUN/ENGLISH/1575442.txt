    In the year 2018-19, Coal India Limited (CIL) had supplied 491.54 Million Tonnes (MT) coal to power plants which was 8.2% more than the coal supplied in 2017-18. Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) supplied 55.3 MT coal to power plants in 2018-19 which was a growth of 3.6% over the same period of previous year. This has led to creation of a coal stock of 30.95 MT at the power plants as on 31.03.2019 which was sufficient for 18 days requirement. In 2018-19, the power plants of Tangedco have been supplied 23.26 MT coal from CIL with a growth of 3.5% over the supply of 22.49 MT in 2017-18. As on 16.06.2019, Tamil Nadu power plants have coal stock of 9.67 lakh tonne which is sufficient for 12 days requirement. At present, no power plant in Tamil Nadu is in critical/super critical category. Some of the numerous steps taken to augment coal supply to power plants are:


     1. The power plants in close vicinity of coal fields have been advised to move coal through road mode.

     2. For proper utilization of Goods sheds, the power plants have been advised to move coal through road-cum-rail mode.
     3. Optimal utilization of the captive modes of transport like, MGR, Belts, Ropes to move coal to the concerned power plants.
     4. Supply of coal to Power plants through rail mode is prioritized.
     5. Coal supplies to Power sector is monitored regularly by an Inter-Ministerial Sub-group comprising representative of Ministry of Power, Ministry of Coal, Ministry of Railways and Ministry of Shipping, Coal India Limited etc.

    As a result of these steps, coal stock at power plants as on 16.06.2019 has increased to 27.01 MT from 15.44 MT as on 16.06.2018.


    This information was given by the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines Shri Pralhad Joshi in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha today.
