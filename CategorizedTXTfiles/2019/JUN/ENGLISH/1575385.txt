This is achieved through induction of new equipment and technological upgradation of capabilities. The equipment requirement of the Armed Forces are planned and progressed through a detailed process which include 15 year Long Term Integrated Perspective Plan (LTIPP), a five year Service-wise Capital Acquisition Plan, a two year roll-on Annual Acquisition Plan and deliberations by the Defence Acquisition Council chaired by the Raksha Mantri.
