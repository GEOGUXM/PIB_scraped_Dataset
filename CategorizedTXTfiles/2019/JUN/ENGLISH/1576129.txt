      Posted On: 28 JUN 2019 1:05PM by PIB Delhi


    At present, the Government does not have any authentic estimates of allied professions, other than what is being reported by various associations/similar bodies. On the basis of available information, 53 Allied and Healthcare Professions under 15 recognized categories have been included in the Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2018, already introduced in RajyaSabha.


    As on date, there is no Central regulatory body for allied health professions. However few States are reported to have statutory mechanism for regulation of allied and healthcare related professions (Paramedical Council or State Physiotherapy or Occupational Therapy Council etc.).


    The Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2018 provides for regulation and maintenance of standards of education and services by allied & healthcare professionals besides maintenance of Central Register of such professionals, who lack a comprehensive regulatory mechanism.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), ShAshwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
