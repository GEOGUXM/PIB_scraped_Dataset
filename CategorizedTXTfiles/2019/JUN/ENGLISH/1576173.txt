      Black Marketing of Goods and Commodities
      Posted On: 28 JUN 2019 4:14PM by PIB Delhi


    In the recent past no specific incident of large scale black marketing of essential commodities has come to the knowledge of the Government. The Essential Commodities Act (EC Act), 1955 and the Prevention of Blackmarketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, (PBMMSEC Act), 1980 provide the legislative and administrative foundation to control hoarding and blackmarketing of essential commodities. Powers to control hoarding, blackmarketing etc. under these Acts have been delegated to States/ UTs. State/UT Governments are advised/sensitised from time to time to take appropriate action against hoarding & blackmarketing and enforce the two Acts, effectively.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, and Shri. Danve Raosaheb Dadarao in the Rajya Sabha today.
