    Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Shri G. Kishan Reddy visited the National War Memorial here today and paid tribute to the jawans who laid down their lives for the country post-independence.


    While paying homage, he assured the families of Defence Forces and Central Armed Police Forces that the whole nation stands firmly with the Jawans and appreciates the hardships and sacrifices being made by them. He also thanked Honâ€™ble Prime Minister, who for the first time after Independence thought about the construction of a Memorial where we can commemorate the sacrifices of our soldiers. Shri Reddy added, the Memorial will act as a valuable source of inspiration for our future generations about the supreme sacrifices and selfless services rendered by brave soldiers for a safe India.
