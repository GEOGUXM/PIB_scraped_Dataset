    A university or medical institution in India which grants a medical qualification not included in the First Schedule of Indian Medical Council (IMC) Act, 1956 applies to the Central Government, to have such qualification recognized, and the Central Government, after consulting the Medical Council of India, by notification in the official Gazette, amends the First Schedule so as to include such qualification therein, and any such notification also directs that an entry shall be made in the last column of the First Schedule against such medical qualification declaring that it shall be a recognized medical qualification granted after a specified date.


    Medical Council of India (MCI)/Board of Governors did not recognize any degree, Post Graduate diploma or any certificate course after Indian Medical Council (IMC) Amendment Act, 1993 without prior permission and recognition of Medical Council of India or Board of Governors.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), ShAshwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
