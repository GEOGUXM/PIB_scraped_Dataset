    National Cooperative Dairy Federation of India (NCDFI) informed that, they have launched an online marketplace namely “NCDFI e-Market” in June, 2015 for trading of bulk dairy commodities i.e. Skimmed Milk Powder and Butter. Presently, only member cooperatives of NCDFI are allowed to sell at the portal. Major dairy cooperatives like Karnataka milk Federation Ltd(Nandini dairy) and Gujarat Milk marketing Federation Ltd(Amul) have their own digital platform to sell their milk products. Besides above, as per information available at cyberspace(Internet), a number of private digital platforms like www.countrydelight.in , www.awesomedairy.com , www.grofers.com , www.naturesbasket.co.in , www.fast2cart.com , www.bigbasket.com etc. also market dairy products in the country.
