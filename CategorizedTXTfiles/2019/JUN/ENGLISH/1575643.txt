    RBI has deregulated the interest rate on advances and these interest rates are determined by banks with the approval of their respective Board of Directors subject to extant guidelines. Loans to MSMEs are provided as per the interest rate structure of the bank. The interest rate is finalized based on various factors which inter-alia include, cost of funds to the institution, credit rating of the unit, tenure of loan, purpose of loan etc.


    This was stated by the Union Minister of Finance & Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in a written reply to a Parliament Question in Rajya Sabha today.
