      Ministry of Steel

      Policy to Increase Export of Steel
      Posted On: 26 JUN 2019 3:42PM by PIB Delhi


    Export incentive schemes of Ministry of Commerce & Industry are aimed at incentivising merchandise exports including steel. Over the last three years, steel imports from China have come down from 2.163 Million MT to 1.562 Million MT. This is a result of imposition of Antidumping and Countervailing measures on Chinese steel imports.


    Steel being a deregulated sector, specific decision on recruitment of employees in private steel sector is taken by individual steel companies/investors on the basis of their requirement. In the case of Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), Steel PSUs, in the last three years and current year regular employment to about 4067 people have been provided.


    This Information was given by the Union Minister for Steel Shri Dharmendra Pradhan in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
