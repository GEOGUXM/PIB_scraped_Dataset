    A group of 140 students, comprising 20 students from Ramban, Reasi & Rajouri and 120 students from Baramulla accompanied by four teachers on a national integration tour visited New Delhi. The group interacted with General Bipin Rawat, Chief of the Army Staff on 10 June 2019 who shared his experiences while serving in these areas and motivated them to work hard and contribute actively in the nation building process. He also exhorted them to join the Indian Armed Forces and serve the Nation.


    The national integration tours are educational and motivational tours for the youth of Jammu & Kashmir and North Eastern states, with an aim to provide an insight into the rich heritage of the country as well as various developmental and industrial initiatives that are underway. This initiative exposes them to various career options and enables them to interact with renowned personalities.
