    The ambit of the PM- Kisan Scheme has been expanded to cover all farmers in the country irrespective of the size of their land holdings, subject to the other existing exclusion criteria.


    The total number of landholding farmers in the country is about 15.11 crore, which has been estimated on the basis of projections of Agricultural Census 2015-16 data for 2018-19. The State-wise details is at Annexure-I . The total number of beneficiary farmer families under the Scheme, after application of exclusion clause, is estimated to be 14.50 crore.


    As per the provisions of the Scheme, the entire responsibility of identifying the eligible beneficiary farmers and uploading their data on PM-KISAN Portal for enabling release of benefits to them is entrusted to the State/UT Governments only. They have already been requested to expedite 100% enlistment of eligible beneficiaries for the revised Scheme and timely uploading of corrected data on PM-KISAN portal. The Central Government on its part regularly monitors the uploading of data by them through Video Conferencing with their State Nodal Officers (PM-Kisan) and Principal Secretaries (Agriculture).


    Farmers who do not own any land are not eligible for this scheme; and


    The survey of landless farmers has not been conducted, therefore, their exact numbers are not available. However, State-wise number of wholly leased-in operational holdings as per the Agriculture Census 2010-11 is available and is annexed at Annexure-II . Various schemes run by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers’ Welfare aim at benefitting the cultivators irrespective of the ownership status, though the PM-Kisan Scheme’s benefit is aimed at land owning farmers.
