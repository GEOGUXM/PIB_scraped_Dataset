    All 35 districts (as per census 2011) of State of Maharashtra are covered under implementation of the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme (BBBP). Out of these, 31 districts are covered under multi - sectorial intervention, Media & Advocacy component and remaining 4 districts are covered under alert Media & Advocacy outreach component of the Scheme.


    The overall target and objective of the Scheme is to improve declining Child Sex Ratio in the country and create an enabling environment for the education of girl child and this requires long-term attitudinal change. The key indicator to achieve this target is to improve the Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB) by 2 points in a year . The latest reports of Health Management Information System (HMIS) of Ministry of Health & Family welfare (MoHFW) reveal that SRB is showing improving trends and has increased from 923 to 931 at National level for the time period between F.Y. 2015-16 & 2018-19.


    At the State/UT level, SRB in 21 States/UTs is showing improving trends whereas 3 States/UT are stable in comparison of previous F.Y. 2017-18. The State of Maharashtra has improved the SRB by 6 points from 924 (2015-16) to 930 (2018-19).
