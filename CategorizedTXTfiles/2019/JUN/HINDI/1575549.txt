    AB-PMJAY covers deprived families in rural areas and families of workers of identified occupational categories in urban areas, as per the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) - 2011 data. All such beneficiary families under RSBY that do not feature in the targeted groups as per SECC data, are also covered under PMJAY. At present, there is no proposal to extend the coverage of PMJAY.


    The State/UT-wise details of beneficiaries covered under AB-PMJAY is given below:
