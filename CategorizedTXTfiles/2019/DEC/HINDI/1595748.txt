      Posted On: 10 DEC 2019 5:24PM by PIB Delhi


    Only possession of Aadhaar number was optional for release of 1st Installment under the scheme pertaining to the 4-monthly period December, 2018 - March, 2019. For release of 2nd installment pertaining to the 4-monthly period April - July, 2019 and onwards, Aadhaar seeding of beneficiaries’ data was compulsory, except for the States of Assam, Meghalaya and J&K where Aadhar penetration is miniscule. In view of delay in Aadhaar seeding of beneficiaries’ data on the part of the State / UT Governments, this condition was relaxed and made applicable for release of 3rd installment pertaining to the 4-monthly period August - November, 2019 and onwards, except for the States of Assam, Meghalaya and J&K which were given exemption till 31.3.2020. However, possession of Aadhaar number remained compulsory for release of 2nd installment. This requirement was further relaxed till 30th November, 2019. The mandatory requirement of Aadhaar seeding of beneficiaries’ data continues to be applicable for release of all installments falling due w.e.f. 1st December, 2019 onwards.


    As on 30.11.2019, 7,60,65,061 beneficiaries in the county have been transferred the financial benefit under PM-Kisan Scheme. The total number of farmers in the country are only estimates made on the basis of the Agriculture Census, 2015-16. Agriculture census is conducted on a quinquennial basis following census-cum-survey approach to collect data on number of operational holdings in the country.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shri Narendra Singh Tomar in Lok Sabha today.
