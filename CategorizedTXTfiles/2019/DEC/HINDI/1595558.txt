The report further mentions that India is placed at 120 th amongst 122 countries in the water quality index, with nearly 70% of water being contaminated.


    As per the 5 th Minor Irrigation Census (with reference year 2013-14) conducted by Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti), there are 20.52 million wells in the country, which includes dug wells, shallow tube wells, medium tube wells and deep tube wells. On the other hand, NITI Aayog figures include only shallow, medium and deep tube wells and do not include dug wells.
