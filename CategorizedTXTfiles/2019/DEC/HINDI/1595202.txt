      Posted On: 06 DEC 2019 1:37PM by PIB Delhi


    As on 03.12.2019, 9,124 private hospitals are empanelled under Ayushman Bharat- Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY). A real time dashboard is active where all the implementing states provide details of utilization of benefits in empanelled hospitals in all districts. Regular reviews are held in cases of apparent underutilization or over utilization.


    Also, beneficiaries reach out to implementing State Health Agency (SHA) or National Health Authority (NHA) when denied treatment at any empanelled hospitals. So far, 346 such complaints were received at NHA helpline/grievance portal that were resolved with the help of concerned SHA.


    Beneficiaries are also informed through auto messages from the system from the time they register for e-cards and are provided the helpline number for any complaint or grievance.


    Further, regular IEC activities are undertaken by implementing SHAs to make beneficiaries aware about the scheme and how to utilize benefits under the scheme.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
