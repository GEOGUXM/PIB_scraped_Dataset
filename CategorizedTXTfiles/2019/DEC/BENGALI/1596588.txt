    Kolkata, 15 Dec 2019


    Kolkata was witness to the annual Military Tatoo, which showcases the military might of the Indian Army, on 15 December. The Hon'ble Governor of West Bengal Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar was the Chief guest of the event which was graced by the Army Commander Eastern Command, Lt Gen Anil Chauhan, senior military, civillian dignitaries and guests from Bangladesh. This open-to- public event saw a huge turnout of people from across the city and state.


    This grand event showcased the various military skills of the Army that are generally not displayed regularly for the common public. The show started with an impressive fly past of Army helicopters which included Advanced Light Helicopters and Rudra, the indigenously built Attack Helicopter, which was later on display for the attendees. The paratroopers of the elite Parachute Regiment and the Special Forces also carried out gravity-defying free fall jumps from thousands of metres and executed perfect landings in front of the grand stand.


    The event witnessed a captivating show by the Army Mules who were brought specially for the show. The Army equestrian team also entertained the audience with scintillating riding display and entertained all with trick riding feats. The event culminated with motorcycle show by Indian Army Team Tornadoes.


    Events of such nature are ideal for creating awareness amongst the public about the Army.
