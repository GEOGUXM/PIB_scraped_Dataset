    Infrared measurements are done during bright sunlit conditions while X-ray measurements are carried out during phases of solar activity.


    Imaging Infrared Spectrometer (IIRS) aims to identify and map the location of minerals using absorption features in the reflected sunlight from the Moonâ€™s surface. The extended operational band of IIRS also enables clear identification and mapping of water-ice on the sunlit lunar surface. The extended band of 3-5 microns in infrared enables improved capability to subtract the thermal background which otherwise causes uncertainties in estimating the water signature.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
