    Exports of jute goods to Top 20 countries during last 3 years with export value is enclosed at Annexure –I .


    A number of schemes have been implemented to provide assistance to jute industries in order to enable them to compete in the global market. The details of the scheme are given below:


    (i) Export Market Development Assistance Scheme (EMDA):It is being implemented to facilitate registered manufacturers and exporters of jute products to participate in international fairs and business delegation abroad for export promotion of lifestyle and other JDPs and boost exports. The registered jute exporters are entitled for reimbursement of the expenditure on space rent +decoration upto maximum 50% and economy class Airfare (for 2 passengers) + Accommodation up to maximum 50% subject to maximum of Rs 3.75 lakh(being 50% of total expenditure of Rs 7.50 lakh). During 2014-15 to 2018-19, an amount of Rs 1720 lakhs has been disbursed to registered jute exporters for participation in International fairs for export, promotion of Jute Products under the scheme. Export of jute products are also covered for benefit under Duty Drawback Scheme and other market linked export promotion schemes of Ministry of Commerce, Govt. of India. The schemes facilitate the jute exporters to negotiate the business deals with international buyers at reasonable price.


    (ii) Incentive Scheme for Acquisition of Plants & Machinery (ISAPM): The Incentive Scheme for Acquisition of Plant & Machinery (ISAPM) for modernization in Jute mills & JDP units is implemented to increase the productivity of the jute machinery and making them efficient by replacing the old machines by new and technologically advanced machines. During 2014-15 to 2018-19, capital subsidy amounting to Rs. 49.71 crores to jute mills and JDP units has been released.


    Whenever the market price of raw jute falls below a certain level, the Jute Corporation of India (JCI) procures raw jute without any quantity ceiling at Minimum Support Price (MSP), fixed on the basis of recommendation of the Commission for Agricultural Cost and Prices (CACP) from jute growers to safeguard their interest. CACP takes the view of all the stakeholders and factor in all the contributors catering to inflation, before giving the recommendation of MSP for every year.


    Due to cost advantage for jute mills in Bangladesh along with export subsidy and other incentives by the Bangladesh government along with better quality of raw jute available in Bangladesh, Bangladesh is able to out price India in most of the foreign markets. However, Government of India has been taking all possible measures to boost jute industry in the country by implementing various schemes for development and promotion of jute sector. Further, for computing the Allocation Ratios for the jute mills for distribution of government orders of B. Twill sacking each year, incentive is given to mills for greater product diversification with higher dispatch value in domestic/foreign markets.


    Details of steps / schemes formulated by the Government to promote jute industry have already been enumerated in the above reply. The issue of re-opening of closed mills is a subject being handled by the respective states. However, to protect/revive the jute industries, Government of India has decided to continue Jute Packaging Material (Compulsory Use in Packing Commodities) Act, 1987 keeping in view the interest of raw jute growers and workers involved in the jute industry. This Act has provided uninterrupted market for jute bags. Also, the Government of India has imposed Anti-Dumping Duty to protect Indian Jute growers and farmers. After the imposition of Anti-dumping duty w.e.f. 5.1.2017, an additional demand of 2 lakh Metric Tonnes has been generated in the domestic market for the jute industry, which has led to the reopening of more than 10 Jute Twine Mills located in Andhra Pradesh, benefitting 20,000 workmen directly and indirectly.


    The information related to jute sector has already been enumerated in the above points. In regards to Handloom Sector, a 90% subsidy is provided for procurement of upgraded looms and accessories under HathkarghaSamvardhanSahayataYojna for better quality and productivity of handloom products. 10% subsidy is provided on hank yarn which is applicable on cotton, domestic silk, wool and linen yarn with quantity caps. 100% subsidy in case of SC/ST, Women and BPL weavers is provided for construction of work shed and 75% subsidy in the case of weavers above poverty line. The Government is also providing reimbursement of 75% of fees towards admission to NIOS/IGNOU courses in case of SC, ST, BPL and Women learners belonging to handloom weaver’s families.
