    Key initiatives taken up during the Year 2019:

      * To lay emphasis on water related works, special drive was taken up under Jal Shakti Abhiyan and 1,220 water stressed blocks were targeted for water conservation in a project mode from 1st July to 15th September, 2019 (Phase I) and 1st October to 30th November, 2019 (Phase II). An expenditure of Rs. 3,158.91 crore was incurred in completion of 3.12 lakh works.
      * A 100 Days programme for Completion of NRM Works was also taken up. A focused approach was followed for enhancing implementation of water related works across all the rural blocks from 5th July to 15th October, 2019. 12.47 lakh works were completed.
      * The Ministry has initiated an integrated holistic planning of the Gram Panchayats based on watershed development using GIS approach. So far, plans for 12,365 GPs have been designed in a saturation mode for three-years planning.

    Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G)


    In the context of Government’s priority for “Housing for All” by 2022, the erstwhile rural housing scheme has been restructured into Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), which came into effect from 1 st April, 2016.


    PMAY-G aims to provide a pucca house with basic amenities to all houseless households and households living in kutcha and dilapidated house by 2022.The target number of houses to be constructed by the year 2021-22, to achieve the objective of “Housing for All” is 2.95 Crore which is proposed to be achieved in phases. In the first phase 1.00 crore houses were taken up for construction in 3 years i.e., 2016-17 to 2018-19 and in the second phase 1.95 crore houses would be taken up for construction in 3 years i.e., 2019-20 to 2021-22. PMAY-G enables construction of quality houses by the beneficiaries using local materials, designs and trained masons. For houses to become homes, adoption of a habitat approach through convergence is proposed.


    Main features / initiatives under the scheme

     1. Unit assistance Rs.1,20,000 in plain areas and Rs.1,30,000 in hilly states/difficult areas/IAP districts.

     1. In addition to the unit assistance, the beneficiaries through convergence with Swachh Bharat Mission and MGNREGA would be provided the following :-

     1. Rs.12,000/- as assistance for construction of toilet
     2. Unskilled wages of 90 /95 person days for construction of house

      * III. Ensuring Transparency through


    Identification of beneficiaries


         1. Identification of beneficiaries based on housing deprivation parameters as per Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) 2011 data after due verification by Gram Sabha.

         2. Out of a total of 4.04 crore households found to be eligible as per SECC 2011 data, 2.50 crore households have been found eligible for getting assistance under PMAY-G after due verification by Gram Sabha as on 17th December, 2019.

    Use of comprehensive E and M- Governance solutions

     1. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) : Under PMAY-G, the assistance to beneficiaries is to be transferred electronically through the AwaasSoft-PFMS platform. This ensured seamless transfer of funds electronically into the Bank/Post Office account of each beneficiary through Fund Transfer Order (FTO). During the year 2019-20 (as on 17th December, 2019), a total of 9.01 lakh FTOs amounting to Rs.29,000.76 crore have been generated involving 79.78 lakh beneficiaries.
     2. Evidence based monitoring of house construction using Mobile Application : C apturing and uploading geo-tagged, time stamped photographs of the house at various stages of construction has been made mandatory for sanction and release of assistance to the beneficiaries. The mobile application “Awaasapp” developed for capturing the different stages of construction of houses has reduced the time of verification. As on as on 17th December, 2019 , 10.33 crore images have been captured and 5.32 crore images have been approved after due inspection.

      * IV. Real time convergence with other schemes


     1. Real time web link has been developed with NREGASoft to allow auto creation of a NREGA work against each PMAY-G house sanctioned. This ensures that a beneficiary is able to claim his/her entitlement of 90/95 days of paid unskilled labour for construction of PMAY-G house under convergence with MGNREGA


     1. The guideline of the scheme of Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) implemented by Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas have been modified wherein beneficiary of PMAY-G is eligible for getting free LPG connection under the scheme. IN order to ensure real time convergence, the data of the beneficiaries of PMAY-G whose houses have been completed or nearing completion is being shared with Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas through web services so that all the beneficiaries of PMAY-G are provided free LPG connection.


     1. Other initiatives

     1. Release of Social Audit Guidelines: The guidelines for Social Audit in PMAY-G have been prepared in consultation with National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj (NIRD&PR). The same were released on 13 th November 2019 by Hon’ble Minister of State for Rural Development. The States/UTs have initiated the process of conducting social audit of the scheme in the Gram Panchayats as per the guidelines issued.

     1. Release of Standard Operation Procedure (SoP) in respect of Unwilling Beneficiary of PMAY-G : The SoP had been prepared in consultation with all the States / UTs and have been issued by MoRD on 13.12.2019. The SoP covers almost all scenarios where the beneficiary is unable to construct his/her PMAY-G house due to reasons such as permanent migration, beneficiary not traceable, beneficiary residing in reserved forests, to name a few. The guidelines also detail out the actions to be taken by the State, District and Block agencies in such cases.

     2. Celebration of Awaas Diwas : Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi released the Framework For Implementation (FFI) of PMAY-G and formally launched the scheme on 20 th November, 2016 in Agra, U.P. Since then, every year, 20 th November is celebrated as Awaas Diwas nation-wide. In present year also on 20 th November, 2019, all the states/UTs celebrated Awaas Diwas or Awaas Saptah with zeal and enthusiasm wherein various activities were undertaken with active participation from the beneficiaries of PMAY-G. Some of the common activities include:

     1. Sensitization of beneficiaries about PMAY-G viz. number of installments in which assistance is provided to beneficiary, availability of different housing designs available in that area, awareness about mason training program and availability of trained masons.

     2. Organizing interaction of PMAY-G beneficiaries with local banks to facilitate loan to beneficiaries of PMAY-G.
     3. Organizing Bhoomi Pooja, Grehpravesh in presence of state dignitaries.

     1. Financial Reconciliation Module and Admin Module: Administrative Fund Management System i.e. Admin Module has been developed to track the flow of admin funds till end user level through AwaasSoft. This module also helps in tracking activity-wise flow of admin funds.


    Further, to rectify discrepancies in the financial progress reports of AwaasSoft and to ensure accounting compliance, Financial Reconciliation Module has been developed.


    These modules were made mandatory to use with effect from 1 st September 2019.


     1. House Quality Review Application - Geo-tagged photographs of the PMAY-G houses at different stages of construction including completion are being captured in AwaasSoft. MoRD with the help of NIC has developed a “House quality review application” in AwaasSoft to review the quality of the houses using the captured geo-tagged photographs.


     1. National Awards : Every year Ministry organizes National Awards ceremony towards the year-end wherein the Hon’ble Minister of Rural Development in presence of the other dignitaries of MoRD, awards trophies and certificates to the best performing States, Districts and Blocks for various MoRD schemes including PMAY-G. Also, individual awards and certificates are given to officials / functionaries from State, District, Block and Panchayat for their contribution towards the implementation of PMAY-G. This year also, National Awards Distribution function was held on 19 th December, 2019 wherein Awards were presented to various categories in respect of PMAY-G.


     1. Workshop with building materials manufacturers and suppliers’ association for ensuring Sustained availability of good quality construction materials - The enormous housing targets under PMAY-G demands a huge supply of construction materials which may lead to its scarcity, resulting in an increase in the cost of the materials and supply of degraded materials to meet the demand. The issue of sustained availability of good quality construction materials is being approached by the MoRD from both demand and supply side. With this background, a workshop was organized with building materials manufacturers and suppliers’ association to augment sustained availability of good quality construction materials under PMAY-G on 17 th July 2019.


     1. Updation of Permanent Wait List : Requests have been received from States / UTs with regard to inclusion of those households who though eligible for assistance under PMAY-G as per the parameters specified under SECC-2011, but have not been included in the list of eligible beneficiaries. Since a provision in this regard already exists in the Framework for Implementation of PMAY-G, Ministry of Rural Development has developed Mobile Application “Awaas+”, as well as a module in AwaasSoft to capture details of such beneficiaries. Last date for completion of this exercise was 7 th March, 2019. Ministry has already constituted a Committee of Experts for analysis of the data captured using mobile application “Awaas+” so as to arrive at the most logical methodology to identify and including the most deserving households in the PWL for aiding under PMAY-G.


     1. Mason Training


    One of the major initiatives of Minisry of Rural Development in the direction of improving the quality of PMAY-G houses and providing livelihood opportunities has been towards ensuring ‘Skill Development of Rural Masons’. This is being done through a formal mechanism of training, assessment and certification. Ministry of Rural has developed Rural Mason Qualification Pack (QP) in consultation with Construction Skill Development Council of India (CSDCI) and got it approved by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC). As on 1 st December, 2019, a total of 90,469 have been enrolled for mason training out of which 79,680 have been assessed and 54,990 have been certified under rural mason training programme


     1. House Design Typologies


    Department of Rural Development in this direction in collaboration with UNDP and IIT, Delhi had taken up studies in 18 States viz., West Bengal, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Sikkim, Manipur, Chattisgarh, Tripura, Meghalaya, Maharashtra, Bihar, Odisha, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Mizoram, and Rajasthan. The states have been divided into different housing zones which have been identified on the basis of local materials and technologies, vulnerability to disasters / hazards, livelihood aspects linked to housing designs and existing community skills. The housing zones identified in a State also took into consideration the prevailing socio-cultural practices. Different house design typologies that are suitable for different housing zones have been identified for the above States. A Compendium titled 'Pahal' comprising of 106 identified house design typologies has also been compiled by the MoRD. The compendium aims to provide government decision makers, engineers engaged in PMAY-G implementation, Panchayats, masons and potential beneficiary households with wider range of options related to designs, materials and technologies for implementation of PMAY-G.


    House design typologies have also been developed by Gujarat, Arunachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Punjab & Tamil Nadu. States/ UTs are encouraged to adopt design typologies compiled in 'Pahal' and/ or developed by the States.


    Demonstration houses based on house design typologies are constructed in the States of Tripura, Sikkim and Maharashtra.


     1. Regional Workshops on “Sharing of Best Practices”: Regional workshops for sharing of best practices were organized for Northern, Eastern, Western, North-Eastern and Southern States. The objective of the workshop was to


     1. Inculcate and adopt best practices: During these workshops all the participant states share the best practices adopted by the States to improves scheme implementation.

     2. Address open issues and challenges : Officials from various divisons of MoRD and other related Central Government Departments like National Informatics Centre (NIC), Internal Finance Division (IFD), Public Finance Management System (PFMS), Construction Skill Development Council (CSDC), Chief Controller of Accounts (CCA) also accompanied during these workshops held at various locations across India. The purpose is to address issues raised by the participant States / UTs and try to solve maximum issues on the on the spot.
