    Under the North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme (NESIDS) against allocation of Rs.1510 crore, so far 55 projects costing Rs.1765.12 crore have been sanctioned. The excess is on account of adjustment for savings which accrued in the erstwhile scheme of Non- Lapsable Central Pool of Resources (NLCPR), which has been restructured as NESIDS.


    The details of the projects sanctioned under NESIDS are as under:-
