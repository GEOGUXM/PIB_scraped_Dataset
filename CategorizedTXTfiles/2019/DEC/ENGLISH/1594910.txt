      Regulation of E-Commerce Companies
      Posted On: 04 DEC 2019 4:46PM by PIB Delhi


    There is no distinction between the taxation regimes of Indian and foreign e-commerce companies as such, however the taxation regimes applicable to domestic companies and foreign companies differ.


    The income of domestic companies is taxed at the rate of 30% plus surcharge and cess however the Finance (No.2) Act, 2019 introduced a tax rate of 25 % plus surcharge and cess for domestic companies having a turnover or the gross receipt up to Rs. 400 crores. Further, in order to attract fresh investment, create jobs and stimulate overall economic growth the Taxation Laws (Amendment), Ordinance, 2019 promulgated on 20.9.2019 gave an option to existing domestic companies not availing any incentive/deductions to pay tax at the rate of 22 % plus 10 % surcharge and 4 % cess subject to meeting certain conditions. In addition, it also provided that new manufacturing companies not availing any incentive/deduction, set up on or after 01.10.2019 can avail the option to pay tax at the rate of 15 % plus 10 % surcharge and 4 % cess subject to meeting certain conditions.


    In case of foreign companies, the income can arise in India in the following scenarios:

     1. As a foreign company
     2. Through branch of a foreign company operating in India
     3. Through a domestic company as a subsidiary of a foreign company

    The income of a foreign company is taxed at the rate of 40 % when the foreign company has a Permanent Establishment (PE) in India subject to the provisions under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between India and the foreign country of which the foreign company is a resident, if any.


    In 2016, India enacted and implemented the Equalisation Levy, which is a flat rate tax of 6% on the revenue derived by a non-resident MNE providing digital advertising services to Indian customers, without having a physical presence in India. The Levy is not a corporate income-tax and is not subject to any limitations under India’s tax treaties.


    (b): Not Applicable.


    (c): The extant Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy on e-commerce sector, inter-alia, specifies that e-commerce marketplaces will not directly or indirectly influence the sale price of goods or services and shall maintain a level playing field. Violations of FDI policy are covered under the penal provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA).


    In order to provide clarity to the extant FDI policy on e-commerce, this Department has issued Press Note 2 of 2018 on 26.12.2018 (Annexure-I) , and no changes have been made in the recent past in the FDI Policy on e-commerce sector.


    Further, in order to ensure compliance of FDI guidelines contained in Press Note 2(2018), this Department has requested DEA and RBI to notify the following clause under FEMA:


    “e-Commerce marketplace entity with FDI will have to obtain and maintain a report of statutory auditor by 30th of September of every year for the preceding financial year confirming compliance of the e-commerce guidelines.”


    A National e-Commerce policy is under preparation. The first draft of the policy was placed in public domain on 23 rd February, 2019 for seeking comments/inputs of stakeholders. On the basis of the inputs/comments received, the draft National e-Commerce policy is being prepared with an aim to create a facilitative regulatory environment for growth of e-commerce sector in India.


    The measures taken by the Government to give impetus to Startups is at Annexure-II .

    Steps specific to taxation for Startups:


    In order to provide an impetus to start-ups and facilitate their growth in the initial phase of their business various measures have been undertaken by the Government including the following:


    1. In order to facilitate ease of doing business and to promote start up India numerous tax incentives have been provided as under:


    (a) 100% deductions to the profit of the start-up:


    Section 80-IAC in the Act has been provides for 100%, deduction to profits of eligible start-ups for three consecutive years out of seven years from the year in which such start-up is incorporated. The benefit is available to start ups incorporated on or after the 1st day of April 2016 but before the 1st day of April, 2021 and are engaged in innovation, development or improvement of products or processes or services, or a scalable business model with a high potential of employment generation or wealth creation.


    (b) Exemption from capital gains for investment in start-up:


    In order to incentivize the investment in the eligible start-up, section 54GB of the Income-tax Act has been amended so as to provide that capital gain arising from transfer of residential property (residential house or plot of land) to an individual or HUF shall be exempted from taxation if the same is invested in the capital of eligible start-up subject to fulfilment of certain specified conditions.


    (c) Relaxation for carry forward and set-off of loss by start-up:


    Section 79 of the Income-tax Act contains certain restrictions for carry forward and set-off of losses in case of certain companies in case of change of majority shareholding. In order to facilitate the new investment in the start-up, the provisions of section 79 have been amended so as to allow an option to an eligible start-up to carry forward and set-off of losses even in the case of change in majority shareholding if the original shareholders continue to hold their shares.


    (d) Exemption from deeming of income for excessive share valuation:


    Section 56(2)(viib) provides for deeming of income in case the shares are issued at a price higher than the fair market value of such shares. In order to ease the compliance burden as well as to promote the start-ups, this provision has been relaxed in the case of recognised start-ups. Under this relaxed regime, the provisions of section 56(2)(viib) are not applicable to the recognised start-up if it files a declaration. As this regime was notified in February, 2019, a circular has been issued by the CBDT for making this regime applicable to the assessment completed in the past also.


    2. Further, a series of announcements have been made by the Hon’ble Finance Minister in her Budget Speech of 2019 and also on 23 rd August, 2019 addressing the grievances of Startups. To give effect to these announcements, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has issued various circulars/clarifications in the matter.


    (i) Assessment of Startups: -


    The circular No. 16/2019 dated 7 th of August,2019 provided the following procedure for pending assessment of the Startups so that the process of scrutiny assessment is made hassle free in the case of eligible Startups: -


     1. In case of Startup companies recognized by the DPIIT which have filed Form No. 2 and whose cases are under “limited scrutiny” on the single issue of applicability of section 56(2) (viib) of the Act, the contention of the assessee will be summarily accepted.


     1. In case of Startup companies recognized by DPIIT which have filed Form No. 2 and whose cases have been selected under scrutiny to examine multiple issues including the issue of section 56(2) (viib) of the Act, the issue will not be pursued during the assessment proceedings and inquiry on other issues will be carried out by the Assessing Officer only after obtaining approval of the supervisory authority.


     1. In case of Startup Companies recognized by the DPIIT, which have not filed Form No. 2, but have been selected for scrutiny, the inquiry in such cases also will be carried out by the Assessing Officer only after obtaining approval of the supervisory authorities.


    (ii) Procedure for addition made u/s 56(2) (viib) in the past assessment: The clarification issued on 9 th August, 2019 provided that the provisions of the section 56(2)(viib) of the Act shall also not be applicable in respect of assessment made before 19 th February, 2019 if a recognized Startups has filed declaration in Form No. 2 and ensuring a hassle free environment to eligible Startups during appellate stage as well.


    (iii) Income-tax demand: - It has also been intimated that the outstanding Income-tax demand relating to additions made under section 56(2) (viib) shall not be pursued and no communication with the assessee in respect of outstanding demand shall be made for this purpose. In respect of other Income-tax demand, it was decided that the Income-tax demand shall not be pursued unless the demand is confirmed by the ITAT.


    (iv) Constitution of Startup cell: In order to redress the grievances and to address various tax related issues in the case of Startups, a Startup Cell at the level of CBDT has been constituted on 30 th August, 2019. This Startup cell has been given wide publicity and is placed at the public forum so that it remains easily accessible to all kinds of queries from the Startups.”
