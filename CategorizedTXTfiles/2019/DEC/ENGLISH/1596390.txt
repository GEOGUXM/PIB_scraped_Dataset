      Posted On: 13 DEC 2019 5:47PM by PIB Delhi


    The prototype of one kilogram(NPK-57) is already available in India and placed at the National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi as per the provisions made under the Legal Metrology (National Standards) Rules, 2011. The new definition of kilogram which has come into effect from May, 2019 and few countries have developed the system of realisation of unit of mass ‘kg’. The previous definition of kilogram was based on the mass of the international prototype ‘kilogram’ which is an artefact, however, the new definition is based on physical constant of nature. The change in the definition of kilogram will not have any implication in daily life in weighing of pharma and precious metals.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri Danve Raosaheb Dadarao in Rajya Sabha today.
