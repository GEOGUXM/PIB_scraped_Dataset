    These are the figures of adoption only under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. A large number of domestic adoptions happen under the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act (HAMA), 1956, details of which are not maintained by CARA.


    The details of children supported under Child Protection Services (CPS) Scheme as informed by the States/UTs as on 28.11.2019 is at Annexure-I .


    Adoptions under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 and Adoption Regulations, 2017 are being regulated by State Adoption Resource Agency (in-country adoptions) and Central Adoption Resource Authority (inter-country adoptions).


    Under the regulations, specified time-lines have been stipulated for each process and the responsibilities of different agencies have been fixed. The process of adoption is executed with the help of an online application - Child Adoption Resource Information and Guidance Systems (CARINGS), in order to complete the process in transparent manner.


    In case Specialized Adoption Agencies (SAAs) do not subscribe to the provisions of Act or Adoption Regulations, penal provisions for taking actions against SAA have been prescribed under Sections 65 (4) & 66 (3) of JJ Act, 2015 and Regulation 25 of Adoption Regulations, 2017.


    Details of complaints of illegal activities reported against SAAs are at Annexure-II .

MahadevShishuGreh, Mirzapur, UP                                    The SAAs were de-licensed by the State Government after numerous complaints were received against the agencies by the prospective adoptive parents and large numbers of deaths of children were reported. Further, inquiry by the State Government revealed irregularities and poor child care by the agencies which were run by the same person. The agencies have approached the High Court of Allahabad against the decision of the State Government.
