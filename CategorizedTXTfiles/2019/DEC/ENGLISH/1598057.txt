Around one lakh GPs have onboarded this interface.
     3. Gram Manchitra: Gram Manchitra is a Spatial Planning Application launched by Hon’ble Minister of Panchayati Raj on October 23, 2019 on the occasion of National Panchayat Awards, 2019, for facilitating and supporting GP users to perform planning at Gram Panchayat level with the use of geo-spatial technology.
