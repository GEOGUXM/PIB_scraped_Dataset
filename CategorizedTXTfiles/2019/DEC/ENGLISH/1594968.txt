      Funds for North-Eastern States
      Posted On: 04 DEC 2019 5:44PM by PIB Delhi


    As per extant guidelines, each Central Ministry/Department is expected to spend 10% of its Gross Budgetary Support (GBS) as per prescribed norms in North Eastern Region (NER). However, no state-wise allocations are made and funds are released to the States based on requirements against sanctioned projects/schemes. In addition, Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (MDoNER) and North Eastern Council (NEC) implement some schemes like Non-Lapsable Central Pool of Resources (NLCPR), North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme (NESIDS), North East Road Sector Development Scheme (NERSDS) etc. for bridging the infrastructure gaps in certain identified sectors in the NER. Normative allocations under schemes of MDoNER and Schemes of NEC are done as per prescribed norms which inter alia include area; population; human development index, road density; percentage of census villages electrified; number of hospital beds; percentage of households having safe drinking water and completion rate of projects. Release of funds by MDoNER and NEC under their schemes is based on the progress of implementation of projects. The status of funds released during the last five years under the schemes of MDoNER and NEC is as under:-

    Although in some cases, delays have been noticed in completion of the projects from the schedule, keeping in view various constraints like short working season, difficult terrain, etc., the pace of development in North Eastern States is considered satisfactory. Continuous efforts are being made for further improvement in the pace of development.
