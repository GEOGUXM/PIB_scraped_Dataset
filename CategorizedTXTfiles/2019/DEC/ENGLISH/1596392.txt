      Disposal of Cases by Consumer Courts
      Posted On: 13 DEC 2019 5:49PM by PIB Delhi


    At present, National Commission, 35 State Commissions and 650 District Consumer Forums are operational. As per the CONFONET portal, during last 5 years (2014-2018), 8,33,823 cases have been filed in these Consumer Fora for violation of consumer's interests out of which 546017 cases have been adjudicated as per the norms/Act. Vacant posts of President and Members in Consumer Commissions, shortage of support staff etc. are some of the reasons for low rate of disposal of consumer cases.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri Danve Raosaheb Dadarao in Rajya Sabha today.
