    e-NAM, which aims at integrating mandis on a virtual platform, is a reform linked scheme. States/ Union Territories (UTs) who have carried out three mandatory reforms namely (i) single trading license to be valid across the State (ii) single point levy of market fee across the State and (iii) provision for e-auction / e-trading as a mode of price discovery; are eligible for integrating their wholesale regulated markets with e-NAM platform. Based on the proposals received from requisite reformed States/UTs, the wholesale regulated markets are approved and integrated with e-NAM platform. As per the target, 585 wholesale regulated markets have already been integrated with e-NAM platform and additional 415 wholesale regulated markets have been approved for integration with e-NAM platform.
