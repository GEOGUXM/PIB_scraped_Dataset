    MDoNERhas implemented two Livelihood programs, namely, North East Rural Livelihood Project (NERLP) and North Eastern Region Community Resource Management Project (NERCORMP). NERLP has concluded on 30 th September, 2019 and NERCORMP is scheduled for completion on 31 st March, 2020. Ministry of Rural Development has extended its Scheme, DAY-NRLM (DeenDayalAntyodayaYojana - National Rural Livelihood Mission), to all the blocks in all the districts of the North East Region with focus on community mobilisation, institution building and livelihood financing. In order to avoid duplication of efforts and resources, MDONERhas decided to restructure the two livelihood programmes of MDoNER i.e. NERLP and NERCORMP by merging them into one and rename the new project as ‘ North East Agri-Horticulture and Economic Development Project’.
