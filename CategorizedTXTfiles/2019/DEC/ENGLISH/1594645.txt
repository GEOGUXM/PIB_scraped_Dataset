    The performance of States/UTs is assessed through State Health Index (SHI) report and Conditionality Framework. SHI (Health States Progressive India) report is an annual systemic tool to focus attention of States/UTs on achieving better outcomes. The Health Index consists of a limited set of relevant indicators categorized in the domains of Health Outcomes, Governance and Information, and key Inputs/Processes. States and UTs are grouped in three categories to ensure comparability among similar entities, namely 21 Larger States, 8 Smaller States, and 7 UTs. 2 rounds of the report have been published so far by NITI Aayog and the latest (second) round of the report was published in June, 2019 and same is accessible at: http://social.niti.gov.in/uploads/sample/health_index_report.pdf


    Similarly, Health System Strengthening – Conditionality Report of States 2018-19 reviews the annual performance of States/UTs. The framework of conditionality has been developed keeping in mind the priorities in the health sector in India. This also gives the current State administrators ample opportunity for better implementation and improvement in performance on key programme areas and health sector reforms. Health System Strengthening – Conditionally Report of States 2018-19 has been published in 2019 and same is accessible at https://nhm.gov.in/showfile.php?lid=714


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
