In order to have all Institutes / Centres working in the field of tribal health on a single platform, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare established Tribal Health Research Forum (THRF) on 9 th August 2010, which is committed to prioritize research addressing specific health needs of the tribal population.


    Under the THRF, there are 16 Institutes / Centres and major Divisions of ICMR under leadership of National Institute of Research in Tribal Health (NIRTH), Jabalpur. 10 Tribal Health Research Units (THRUs) have been established by ICMR in two phases, which are functioning with an overall mandate to improve tribal health through diagnosis and develop strategies for management in their sub-population with emphasis on various infectious diseases as well as non-communicable diseases, apart from haemoglobinopathies, nutrition and maternal and child health etc. These units worked to outline the health problems of tribal population and generated evidence for policy change.
