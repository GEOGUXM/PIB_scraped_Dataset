    Presently six AIIMS at Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Jodhpur, Patna, Raipur and Rishikesh are fully functional with 100 MBBS, 60 B.Sc. (Nursing) and PG seats. Hospital services are also operating with substantial capacity. All key hospital facilities and services such as Emergency, Trauma, Diagnostic, Pathology, Blood Bank are functioning. Basket of services in these six AIIMS has been expanded and presently, on an average, more than15000 patients are visiting OPD daily besides more than 15000 patients getting treatment in IPD every month with more than 3500 major surgeries getting performed every month.


    Besides AIIMS Bhubaneswar which is already functional, presently there is no proposal to set up more new AIIMS in the state of Odisha.


    As far as Medical Colleges are concerned, five districts namely Balasore, Baripada (Mayurbani), Bolangir, Koraput and Puri have been approved for establishment of new medical colleges under Phase-I and one in the District of Jajpur under Phase-II of centrally sponsored scheme “Establishment of new medical colleges attached with existing district / referral Hospital”


    Further, Phase-III of the Scheme has been approved by the Cabinet on 20.08.2019, wherein 75 more new Medical Colleges are being established all over the country. The State/UT Governments have been requested to send their proposals under the Phase-III scheme along with Detailed Project Report as per scheme guidelines for consideration by the Ministry. However, so far, no proposal has been received from State Government of Odisha for establishment of new Medical College under Phase-III.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
