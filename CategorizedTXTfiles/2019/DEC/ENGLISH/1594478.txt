Under the Scheme, a total of Rs. 4,62,115.61 crore of loan amount has been provided to women entrepreneurs as on 15.11.2019.


    In addition to the above , a loan facilitator and skill training programme is going on through Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs) under which assistance is given to aspiring entrepreneurs in the form of bank credit and skill training through RSETI to become self-employed and start their own micro enterprises with focus on rural poor. Presently, 583 RSETIs are functioning in 27 States (expect Goa) and 6 UTs (except Delhi, Chandigarh and Daman & Diu).
