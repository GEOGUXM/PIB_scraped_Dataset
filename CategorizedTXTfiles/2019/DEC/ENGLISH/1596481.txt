    Narcotics Control Bureauâ€™s (NCB) Delhi Zonal Unit and Operations achieved a major breakthrough in busting an International and pan-India level drug cartel and has effected the largest catch of cocaine.


    The cumulative seizure of cocaine done by NCB in India is around 20 Kgs, having international value of Rs. 100 crores. 55 Kgs Cocaine and 200 Kgs of Methamphetamine have been seized in Australia. The total international worth of the seized drugs from the drug cartel is about Rs. 1300 crores.


    In pan India level operations, 5 Indians, 1 American national, 2 Nigerian nationals and 1 Indonesian national have been arrested. Consignments of psychotropic drugs in India were found to be sourced from Canada, Australia and USA. The shipments of cocaine and methamphetamine were sent from India to Australia.


    The seizures made by NCB have reflected national and international ramifications which warrants deeper probes to understand the various linkages of these cartels. Looking into the gravity of the offences, NCB has constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to further probe links of this network and for launching effective prosecution.
