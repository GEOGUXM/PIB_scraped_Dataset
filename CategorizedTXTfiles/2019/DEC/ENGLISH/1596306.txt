      Breast Milk Banks
      Posted On: 13 DEC 2019 12:47PM by PIB Delhi


    As per the “National Guidelines on Establishment of Lactation Management Centres in Public Health Facilities”, Breast Milk Banks in India are known as Comprehensive Lactation Management Centres (CLMC) and Lactation Management Unit (LMU), depending on the level of health facilities where these units are established. The national guidelines with operational and technical guidance on establishment of Lactation Management Centres in public health facilities have been shared, and funding support is provided to the States and UTs for the same as per proposals received in their Annual Programme Implementation Plans.


    The foremost endeavour of the health care providers in a health centre is to conserve the natural act of breastfeeding. Lactation Management Centres are in no way intended to lessen the importance of mother’s own milk or the practice of breastfeeding. If mother’s own milk is insufficient or not available for any unavoidable reason, Donor Human Milk (DHM) is the next best alternative to bridge the gap.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), ShAshwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Lok Sabha here today.
