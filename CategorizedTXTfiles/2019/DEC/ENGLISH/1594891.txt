      Redressal of Complaints
      Posted On: 04 DEC 2019 4:16PM by PIB Delhi


    The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances have issued guidelines which provides that a grievance should be redressed within a period of maximum of two months of its receipt. If finalization of a decision on a particular grievance is anticipated to take longer than two months, an interim reply should invariably be sent. These guidelines are also available on pgportal.gov.in. Further Review meetings are being held on regular basis with the Central Ministries/Departments/State Governments/Union Territories for monitoring the pendency of public grievances on the Centralized Public Grievance Redress And Monitoring System [CPGRAMS].


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
