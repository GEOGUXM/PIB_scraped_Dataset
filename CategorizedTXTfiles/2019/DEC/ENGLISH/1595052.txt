    The significant feature of the allocations is that for the first time, the successful bidders shall have the flexibility to sell 25% coal produced in the open market. This will boost the coal production in the country and reduce the dependence of industries on imported coal. It is also envisaged that this step will generate huge revenue for State Governments where the mines are located in the form of Upfront Amount, Royalties and other applicable taxes.
