This will help the sellers in general and the MSMEs in particular to access easy credit and do better business with the government. In addition, GeM is contemplating the creation of EMD pool account for making it easy for sellers to comply with the EMD requirements while responding to bids.

It is an initiative of the Government of India which offers a one stop inclusive platform for facilitating online procurement.
