The main objective of this project is on-site collection of accident data through app-based software and analyse data for identification of black spots and other accident prone areas.


    789 black spots have been identified based on accidents/fatality from year 2011 to 2014. A total of 660 black spots are on the stretches of National Highways (NHs) and 129 black spots are under State Government. 395 black spots have already been rectified and 215 black spots are at implementation stage on stretches of NHs.


    This information was given by the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Shri Nitin Gadkari in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today.
