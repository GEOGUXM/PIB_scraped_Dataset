      Posted On: 02 DEC 2019 6:02PM by PIB Delhi


    There are certain tribal communities who have declining or stagnant population, low level of literacy, pre-agricultural level of technology and are economically backward. These groups are among the most vulnerable section of our society as they are few in numbers, have not attained any significant level of social and economic development and generally inhabit remote localities having poor infrastructure and administrative support. 75 such groups have been identified and categorized as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).


    Ministry of Tribal Affairs is implementing the scheme of “Development of PVTGs” which covers these 75 PVTGs for the activities like education, housing, land distribution, land development, agricultural development, animal husbandry, construction of link roads, installation of non-conventional sources of energy for lighting purpose, social security or any other innovative activity meant for the comprehensive socio-economic development of PVTGs. Under the scheme, State Governments submits Conservation-cum-Development (CCD) Plans on the basis of their requirement. 100% grants-in-aid are made available to States as per the provisions of the scheme. The monitoring mechanism put in place is as detailed below:-


    (i) Utilization Certificates are insisted upon as a pre-requisite for further release of funds as per the norms of GFR;


    (ii) Progress reports regarding the status of implementation of schemes is obtained;


    (iii) Officers while visiting States/UTs also ascertain the progress of implementation of various schemes/ programmes of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs;


    (iv) Meetings/ Conferences are convened at the Central level with State officials for ensuring timely submission of proposals, speeding up of implementation of the schemes/ programmes, and reviewing the physical and financial progress;


    (v) The physical progress of works sanctioned under the schemes including“Development of PVTGs” is monitored through online system of Ministry of Tribal Affairs - http://stcmis.gov.in/smis wherein real time data has to be uploaded by the State Government.
