    BACKGROUND


    The National Energy Conservation Awards Programme recognizes the energy efficiency achievements in 56 sub sectors across industry, establishments and institutions such as thermal power stations, office and BPO buildings, hotels, hospitals, shopping malls, zonal railways, railway workshops and stations, municipalities, State Designated Agencies and manufacturers of BEE Star labeled appliances/equipment and electricity distribution companies.


    As part of its awareness outreach, every year on the national conservation day, BEE recognizes and encourages endeavors of industries and other establishments in reducing energy consumption by felicitating them with National Energy Conservation Awards. Apart from it, BEE also felicitates prizes to the winners of National Painting Competition on Energy Conservation.


    Ministry of Power through Bureau of Energy Efficiency is implementing various policies and schemes viz PAT Scheme, Standard and Labelling, Energy Conservation Building Codes and Demand Side Management. These programmes are helpful in achieving significant energy savings and also, in promotion of the efficient use of energy across society.


    Furthermore, the development of Energy Conservation Guidelines and State Energy Efficiency Preparedness Index are complimented within different sectors of Industries and States for implementing the energy efficiency programmes more effectively. Energy Conservation Building Codes for residential sector are also being developed for curtailing the rising energy demand of the country.


    In order to realize the development goals, India’s energy demand is expected to double between 2013 and 2030, to approximately 1500 million tons of oil equivalent. The mission of BEE is to assist in developing policies and strategies that will help reduce this energy demand by promoting widespread adoption of energy efficiency measures.
