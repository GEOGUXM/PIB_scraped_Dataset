    p- provisional


    The fish and milk production have been increasing with an average annual growth rate of 6.86 % and 6.41 % respectively, during the last five years. These increases are primarily due to several initiatives/policies taken up by the Government of India Viz . implementation of various Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS)/ Central Sector Scheme (CS).


    Furthermore, the Union Government has also created a separate Ministry for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying with two separate Departments namely (i) Department of Fisheries and (ii) Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, which provides focused attention for the overall development of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying sectors, including enhancement of production and productivity, improving the livelihood of the marginal farmers who are associated in these sectors of the country.


    India is self-sufficient in the production of fish and milk to fulfil the demand, as India is the second largest fish producing county in the world, as well as first position in world with regards to milk production. However, fish and milk production in India have been increasing steadily. Besides, the countryâ€™s per capita availability of egg is estimated at 74 per person per year as per the Basic Animal Husbandry Statistics. However, as per recommendation of National Institute of Nutrition, the requirement of eggs per capita per year will be 183 eggs.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Fisheries, Animals Husbandry & Dairying, Shri.Pratap Chandra Sarangi in Rajya Sabha today.
