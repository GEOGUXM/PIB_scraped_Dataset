      Posted On: 11 DEC 2019 4:24PM by PIB Delhi


    Indian Railways is committed to make its Railway stations and trains accessible for Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan) as part of “Sugamya Bharat Mission” or Accessible India Campaign of Government of India. Improvement/ augmentation of amenities at Railway stations, including those for differently abled passengers, is a continuous process. Provisions of facilities for Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan) are to be made at all stations over Indian Railways. The categorization of stations is reviewed every five years. In April, 2018, it has been decided to change the categorization of Stations from ‘A-1’, ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’, ‘E’ & ‘F’ category to NSG1, NSG2, NSG3, NSG4, NSG5 & NSG6, SG1, SG2 & SG3 and HG1, HG2 & HG3 based on passengers handled and earnings of the stations.


    In order to provide better accessibility to Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan), Short Term Facilities and Long Terms facilities have been planned at all stations (including erstwhile B category stations), beginning with Non Suburban Group ‘NSG1’, ‘NSG2’, ‘NSG3’ & ‘NSG 4’ category stations. The details of Railway stations provided with Short-Term Facilities so far for Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan) under all categories of stations over Indian Railways are as under:-
