      Posted On: 10 DEC 2019 5:26PM by PIB Delhi


    Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare is implementing Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) for holistic development of Horticulture in the country, which includes assistance for development of Post Harvest Management (PHM) including setting up of cold storages. Under MIDH, Rs. 31.50 crore were allocated to the State of Nagaland during 2016-17, Rs. 41.50 crore in 2017-18 and Rs. 32.00 crore in 2018-19 for various horticulture activities including construction of cold storages. However, the State Government of Nagaland has reported that no funds have been utilised for construction of cold storages during this period.


    Further, Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MOFPI) is implementing the Scheme for “Integrated Cold Chain and Value Addition Infrastructure” as one of the components of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana with the objective of reducing post-harvest losses of horticulture & non-horticulture produce and providing remunerative price to farmers for their produce.


    Under the scheme, MoFPI has approved one cold chain project in Dimapur, Nagaland during 2017-18 with an assistance of Rs.8.10 crore which has been completed and is functional. Another cold chain project in Dimapur, Nagaland has been approved during 2018-19 with an assistance of Rs. 9.67 crore, which is under implementation. No cold chain project was approved for Nagaland by MoFPI during 2016-17.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shri Narendra Singh Tomar in Lok Sabha today.
