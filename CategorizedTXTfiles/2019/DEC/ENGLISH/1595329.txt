Year     Amount (Rs. in Crore)
                              
                              
                              
                              
                              
2018-19  1652.67              
                              
                              

    Waiting list passengers can cancel their tickets till 30 minutes before the scheduled departure of the train and take refund as per extant refund rules. Since the passengers can cancel the tickets on their own due to change of plan or due to non-availability of confirmed accommodation, it is not practically feasible to identify the cancellations done only on account of non-confirmation of tickets.
