      Posted On: 02 DEC 2019 4:57PM by PIB Delhi


    Since Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has denied grant of Environment and Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearances for setting-up of Indian Coast Guard Academy at Azhikkal, Kerala, as the project site at Azhikkal falls under CRZ-1(A) area, wherein no construction is permissible as per the CRZ notification, the project of Indian Coast Guard to establish Indian Coast Guard Academy at Azhikkal, Kerala has been dropped.


    This information was given by Raksha Rajya Mantri Shri Shripad Naik in a written reply to Shri Elamaram Kareem in Rajya Sabha today.
