    The Central GST and State GST authorities have organized a nationwide GST Stakeholder Feedback Diwas on New GST Returns on 7 th December 2019 for getting an on-the-spot response to the new GST Returns to be introduced from 1 st April 2020. The focus would be on assessing the ease of compliance and uploading of these new returns so that the trade does not face any difficulty when the returns are made legally mandatory. These feedback sessions would be attended by all prominent chambers of commerce and industry and other organisations representing taxpayers and tax practitioners & compliance managers. The tax officers shall be available to hand hold the taxpayers and assist them in trying out the new returns. This is the first time after introduction of GST that taxpayer consultation is being done on such a large scale.


    On 16 th November 2019 Union Finance Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman had invited some GST taxpayers, Chartered Accountants and Tax practitioners to assess first-hand the response to the various GST returns especially the new Returns to be introduced w.e.f. 1 st April 2020. Several useful suggestions were also received. This initiative by the Finance Minister was widely welcomed by the entire tax fraternity and hailed as a step in the right direction for greater transparency in tax administration. Accordingly, Finance Minister decided that such interaction with stakeholders should be replicated nationwide on 7 th December 2019 to get a much larger feedback on the new return system .


    All GST stakeholders are requested to actively participated in these feedback sessions in their nearest CGST or SGST Office cross the country.
