      Posted On: 03 DEC 2019 1:30PM by PIB Delhi


    Central Government has not issued any guidelines to State Governments to provide medical treatment to the Central Government Pensioners who have valid CGHS Cards. Central government pensioners having valid CGHS cards, which are issued on payment of subscription as prescribed from time to time, are eligible to avail hospitalization care at any of the private hospitals empanelled under CGHS and central government hospitals. Further, provision for availing treatment at hospitals empanelled under Central Services(Medical Attendance) Rules, 1944/ Employees Contributory Health Scheme by CGHS pensioner beneficiaries and their dependent eligible family members already exists under the scheme.


    No permission is required for treatment in any State-run hospitals and any expenditure incurred for treatment at such hospitals is reimbursed under CGHS as per extant rules.


    The Minister of State (Health and Family Welfare), Sh Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated this in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha here today.
