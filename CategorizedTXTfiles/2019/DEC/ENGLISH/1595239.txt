    P-Provisional


    Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare provides the financial assistance to the States and seed producing agencies for production and distribution of seeds through various ongoing crop development programmes/schemes viz. National Food Security Mission, Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture, Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, Sub-Mission on Seeds and Planting Materials under National Mission on Agricultural Extension and Technology etc.


    Organic textiles are the low volume of production and the demand for organic cotton-based products is negligible within the country, mostly because of its high price.


    This information was given by the Union Minister of Textiles, Smriti Zubin Irani, in written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
