Sadananda Gowda, told the Rajya Sabha on 28 th June that NPPA has so far fixed the ceiling prices of the 857 formulations included in Revised Schedule-I of the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO) up to 31st May, 2019.

    In order to make these sanitary pads more affordable and accessible to the women of India, Government of India has now decided to make these pads available at rate of only Rs 1.00/- per pad as promised by the Prime Minister. This is an important step in ensuring the health security for the section of Indian women who still use unhygienic aids during menstrual period due to non-affordability of sanitary pads available in the market.

This step taken by the Department of Pharmaceuticals will ensure the achievement of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s vision of “Affordable and Quality Healthcare” for all. It will also help in fulfilling the Prime Minister’s dream of “Clean India & Green India” as these pads are oxo-biodegradable and environment friendly.
