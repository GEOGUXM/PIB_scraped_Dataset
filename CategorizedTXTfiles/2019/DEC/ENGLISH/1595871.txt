    The Ministry has fully utilized the allocated budget and there has been no underutilization.


    During the period 2015-19, the Government has taken steps to delegate substantial financial power to the Service Headquarters for both normal and emergent procurements. This has resulted in faster decision making and ensured full and optimal utilization of allocated budget.
