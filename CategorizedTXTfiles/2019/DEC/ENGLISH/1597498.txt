    Union Minister of State for Culture and Tourism (IC) Shri Prahlad Singh Patel has said that sign boards in Chinese language have been put up at 5 ASI protected archaeological sites located in Uttar Pradesh. They include the archaeological site at Sarnath, the Buddhist relics at Chaukhandi Stupa, Kushinagar and the Mahaparinirvana Temple, Piparahwa and Shravasti .


    Shri Patel said that keeping in mind the convenience of foreign travelers, Ministry had instructed the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) that sign boards of foreign languages will be installed at all the iconic archaeological sites in India where more than 1 lakh tourists from a particular country visit those places every year. A total of 5 such foreigncountry languages can be included in it. He told that in this series, the work of installing sign boards in Sinhali language has been completed in November 2019 in view of the large number of Sri Lankan tourists visiting Sanchi.


    Shri Prahlad Singh Patel said that our objective is to increase the number of tourists both foreign and domestic, under the Prime Minister's Vision 2020. He said that the Prime Minister is the biggest brand ambassador in our country. The Union Minister said that to increase the number of domestic tourists, the Ministry of Tourism is considering various cultural fairs and other events through which the people of India will get to know India in a better way.
