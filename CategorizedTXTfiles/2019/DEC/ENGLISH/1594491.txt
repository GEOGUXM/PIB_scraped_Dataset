    Since inception of the Phase-I of FAME-India Scheme, about 2.8 lakh hybrid and electric vehicles (xEVs) have been supported through Demand Incentives. As pilot project, about 425 electric/ hybrid buses were sanctioned to various States (city transport undertaking) supported by Department of Heavy Industry (DHI) under FAME-India Scheme (Faster Adoption of Electric (and Hybrid) Vehicles in India). However, since Automobile Sector is a liberalized Sector, the Department of Heavy Industry is not required to maintain the data related to sale of vehicles including Electrical vehicles.
