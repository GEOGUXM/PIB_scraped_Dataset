      Performance of Agricultural Schemes
      Posted On: 06 DEC 2019 5:12PM by PIB Delhi


    As per the erstwihile Planning Commissionâ€™s estimates based on the survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) in 2011-12, 25.7% of rural population is living below the poverty line (BPL) including farm and non-farm rural population. However, separate estimate on the number of farmers living below the poverty line is not available.


    Keeping in view the challenges before the farming community, Government of India regularly monitors and evaluates Schemes from time to time through independent agencies/institutes and revamps them based on the feedback.


    The outcome of performance evaluation of some schemes are as follows and many of them have been revamped based on such studies:


    Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana- Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied Sector Rejuvenation (RKVY-RAFTAAR): The concurrent evaluation of implementation of the RKVY was done during 2016-17 by Institute of Economic Growth (IEG) Delhi. Based partially on the recommendations, the scheme was revamped as RKVY-RAFTAAR which is currently in operation for 2017-18 to 2019-20 with major focus on pre & post-harvest infrastructure, besides promoting agri-entrepreneurship and innovations.


    National Mission on Micro Irrigation: An Impact evaluation study was conducted in 2014 by Global Agri System and conclusions reached were that due the operation of the scheme (i) Irrigation cost reduced by 20% to 50% with average of 32.3%. (ii) Electricity consumption reduced by about 31%. (iii) Average productivity of fruits and vegetables increased by about 42.3 % and 52.8%. (iv) Overall income enhancement of farmers was in the range of 20% to 68% with an average of 48.5%.


    Soil Health Card Scheme: Two impact evaluation studies have been conducted for Soil Health Card Scheme. The first study was by the National Productivity Council (NPC) in February 2016 and the 2 nd study was conducted by MANAGE, Hyderabad in 2017. Constant improvement is carried out in scheme design and implementation based on such studies.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Shri Narendra Singh Tomar in Rajya Sabha today.
