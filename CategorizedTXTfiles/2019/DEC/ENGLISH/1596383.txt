      Posted On: 13 DEC 2019 5:38PM by PIB Delhi


    During 2018-19, China bought frozen shrimp worth USD 392 million (66929 tonne) from India against USD 89 million (13107 tonne) in 2017-18. In the current year (April-September 2019), China has imported frozen shrimp worth USD 404.94 Million (69571 tonne) from India as compared to USD 131.03 Million (21823 tonne) during the same period last year, registering a growth of about 209%.


    Chinese Customs authorities through Embassy of India in Beijing have informed the detection of White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) and Infectious Hypodermal and Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus( IHHNV) in 10 consignments of Vannamei shrimp exported from India and suggested to investigate the cause of detection and take effective control measures in this regard. Since this issue of detection of viruses occurred before India opting out of RCEP, it may not be linked to the same.


    This information was given by the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
