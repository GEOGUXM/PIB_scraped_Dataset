    Indian Railway has kept the passenger fares lower, keeping in view the affordability for common man. Last passenger fare revision was done in 2014-15. Indian Railway continues to incur losses in passenger segment under social service obligations, like- on account of concessions in passenger fares, on EMU suburban services, on uneconomic branch lines, on strategic lines, due to pricing of fares below cost etc.


    Indian Railways continuously strives to improve passenger traffic over its network. With a view to ensure optimum utilisation of available accommodation and enhance earnings, the utilisation of reservation quota is reviewed on a periodical basis and necessary adjustments made, wherever required.


    Further, various initiatives like augmentation of on-board capacity, rationalisation of flexi-fare scheme, graded discount in classes and sections with low occupancy and offering fare of AC chair Car and Second class unreserved for AC-3tier coaches and Sleeper class coaches respectively having low occupancy on particular sections, extension of Alternate Train Accommodation Scheme known as VIKALP have also been undertaken. Measures to improve passenger traffic and enhance earnings is a continuous and an on-going process. New passenger services like Vande Bharat Express, Tejas Express, Air-conditioned Electrical Multiple Unit(EMU) services, Gatiman Express, Anubhuti Coaches etc. with improved features and amenities have been introduced, with appropriate fare structures.


    This information was given by the Minister of Railways and Commerce & Industry, Shri Piyush Goyal in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
