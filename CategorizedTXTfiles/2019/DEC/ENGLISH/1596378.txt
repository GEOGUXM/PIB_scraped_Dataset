    Under Duty Free Import Authorisation (DFIA) scheme, authorization is issued to allow duty free import of inputs. No change has been made regarding transferability in DFIA scheme under para 4.29 of Foreign Trade Policy 2015-20.


    The DFIA scheme is valid only for those export products where a valid Standard Input Output Norms (SION) is in place. The scheme is not available in cases where Standard Input Output Norms have been suspended.


    This information was given by the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.
