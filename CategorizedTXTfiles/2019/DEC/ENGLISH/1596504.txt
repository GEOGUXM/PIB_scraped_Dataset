      Posted On: 14 DEC 2019 6:49PM by PIB Delhi


    The Ministry of Coal has allotted two Coking Coal mines, Rohne and Rabodih, to the Steel Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSE’s). Allocated under the Coal Mines (Special Provision) Act, 2015, these mines located in Jharkhand will add about more than 10 MT per annum and boost the coking coal production in the country. This is a significant step towards reducing the dependence of Steel Industry on imported coal.


    The ‘Rohne’ Coal Mine has been allotted to National Mineral Development Corporation Limited for Sale of Coal and will also serve the purpose of captive use of coking coal to NMDC’s upcoming steel plant at Nagarnar.


    The ‘Robodih OCP’ coal mine has been allotted to Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited for captive use of production of Iron & Steel.


    These mines will, over their lifetime, generate about Rs. 7000/- crore revenue for State Government, besides royalties and other applicable taxes. Both NMDC and RINL would set up their Washeries for washing coal.


    This allotment is in addition to 5 coal mines which have been allocated to successful bidders and 6 coal mines which have allotted to PSU’s. In all, the 13 mines will add more than 35 MT per annum coal to the domestic availability of coal. Apart from the royalties and applicable taxes, the mines are slated to generate about Rs.31000/- crore revenue over their lifetime for State Governments.
