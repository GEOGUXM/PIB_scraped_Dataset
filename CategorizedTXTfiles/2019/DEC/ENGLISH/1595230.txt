    The two-day National Workshop on Preparedness, Mitigation and Management of Heat wave concluded successfully today in Bengaluru with all stakeholders resolving to work towards reducing the adverse effects of Heat Wave in 2020. The workshop was organised by National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), in collaboration with the Government of Karnataka.


    This was the fourth annual workshop in a series that NDMA has been conducting since 2017 to build a momentum ahead of the start of the Heat Wave season. These workshops facilitate States to prepare and implement their Heat Action Plans. In fact, with the combined efforts of all stakeholders, the number of heat-related deaths in the country has significantly come down in the recent years.


    Important deliberations on a range of topics were carried out in five technical sessions during the workshop. These are as follows:

      * Discussions were held on Impact of Climate Change on heat wave. Measures on how to reduce the risk related to heat waves were explored. Panellists discussed the impact of extreme heat on health in India and mainstreaming of Heat Action Plans based on the latest National Guidelines.
      * Senior officials from India Meteorological Department (IMD) also discussed Early Warning and forecasting, and communications strategy for dissemination of heat wave related messages.
      * Some vulnerable States shared their experiences and best practices to help other stakeholders prepare and implement their Heat Action Plans. The success stories from these States emphasised the importance of advanced planning, better preparedness and timely intervention.
      * Presentations were made on capacity building and issues pertaining to effective response; and panel discussions were held on inter-agency coordination.

    Members and senior officials from NDMA, experts on heat wave, early warning and forecasting agencies, State governments, research institutions and members of the civil society participated in the workshop.
