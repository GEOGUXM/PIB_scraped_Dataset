    The Ministry of Textiles, Government of India, participated in World Cotton Day celebrations observed from 7 th October to 11 th October 2019 at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Geneva. The WTO organized the World Cotton Day event in collaboration with the Secretariats of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the International Trade Centre (ITC) and the International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC). Union Minister of Textiles, Smriti Zubin Irani, participated in the plenary session of the event which was attended by heads of states and heads of international organisations.


    WTO hosted the event at the request of the Cotton – 4 countries, Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali to celebrate their official application for the recognition of 7 th October as World Cotton Day by the United Nations. World Cotton Day celebrated the many advantages of cotton, from its qualities as a natural fibre, to the benefits people obtain from its production, transformation, trade and consumption. World Cotton Day also served to shed light on the challenges faced by cotton economies around the world because cotton is important to least developed, developing and developed economies worldwide.


    Between 2011 and 2018, India implemented a Cotton Technical Assistance Programme (Cotton TAP-I) of about USD 2.85 million for seven African countries namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali and Chad and also Uganda, Malawi and Nigeria. The technical assistance focused on improving the competitiveness of the cotton and cotton-based textiles and apparel industry in these countries through a series of interventions which had significant outcomes leading to a demand for a follow on project.


    At the Partners Conference in Geneva, Textiles Minister announced that India will launch the second phase of the Cotton Technical Assistance Programme (TAP) for Africa. In the five year long second phase, the programme will be scaled up in size and coverage and will be introduced in five additional countries, namely Mali, Ghana, Togo, Zambia and Tanzania. The Cotton TAP programme will now cover 11 African countries including the C4 (Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali).


    Cotton is a global commodity that is produced all over the world and a single tonne of cotton provides year-round employment for five people on average. Cotton is a drought – resistant crop ideal for arid climates, it occupies just 2.1 % of the world’s arable land, yet it meets 27% of the world’s textiles need. In addition to its fibre used in textiles and apparel, food products are also derived from cotton like edible oil and animal feed from the seed.

    Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has published an Indian Standard for identification, marking and labelling of Pashmina products to certify its purity in August this year.


    The certification will help curb the adulteration of Pashmina and also protect the interests of local artisans and nomads of Ladakh who are the producers of Pashmina raw material. It will also assure the purity of Pashmina for customers.


    The BIS certification of Pashmina will go a long way in discouraging counterfeit or substandard products presently mislabelled and sold as genuine Pashmina in the market.


    TECHNICAL TEXTILES INDUSTRY IN INDIA


    Technical textiles are material and products manufactured primarily for their technical properties and functional requirements rather than for aesthetic characteristics. The scope of use of technical textiles encompasses a wide range of applications such as; agro-textiles, medical textiles, geo-textiles, protection-textiles, industrial-textiles, sports-textiles and many other usages. Use of technical textiles have benefits of increased productivity in agriculture, horticulture and aquaculture fields; better protection of military, para-military, police and security forces, stronger and sturdier transportation infrastructure for highways, railways, ports and airports and in improving hygiene and healthcare of general public. In India, technical textiles hold immense growth opportunities both for the industry as well as across various applications.


    Technical textiles is the harbinger of many new age applications covering almost all walks of life, and having immense potential for bringing in higher level of productivity, efficiency, cost economics; and offering innovative solutions to many engineering and general applications. In addition to their commercial use, technical textiles have been identified for mandatory use across various important missions, programmes and schemes of the Government of India. Some of these are National Health Mission, Jal Jivan Mission, National Horticulture Mission and infrastructure development of highways, railways and ports. In order to boost a rapid growth of the technical textile segment in the country, the government has taken following major initiatives:


    207 technical textiles items have been brought under separate head in the Harmonised System of Nomenclature (HSN) code under the Foreign Trade Policy.


    With a view to derive the benefits of technical textiles in various fields of applications, currently 92 application areas have been identified for mandatory use across 10 Central Ministries/Departments. Technical textiles has seen an increase in exports by 11% in April – June quarter of 2019.


    Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has developed standards for 348 technical textiles products.


    On request from the Industry, Ministry of Textiles has included 6 additional courses for technical textiles in its Skill Development Programme called Samarth.


    The work of conducting fresh baseline survey on technical textiles sector has been given to IIT Delhi.


    The Ministry has issued Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order dated 23.10.2019, prescribing minimum local purchase content for technical textiles items in 10 segments for government procurement.


    In terms of the projections of the last baseline survey on technical textiles submitted in 2015, the market size in India for the year 2017-18 is projected as Rs 1,16,217 crore. Although, there is no projection in the last baseline study with regard to the projections for the 2020-21, taking into account the current trend of growth and various initiatives of the Government, domestic market size of the technical textiles is expected to cross Rs 2 lakh crores by the year 2020-21.


    Scheme for Promoting Usage of Agro textiles in North East Region:


    The usage of Agro textiles in the North East Region has led to average increase in farmers’ income by 67% to 75%. Increase in intensity of crop cycles by 3 to 4 crops in a year is seen as there is cultivation throughout the year. It has led to reduced water consumption by 30%-45% and has prevented damages to crops due to birds and hailstone.


    Scheme for Promoting Usage of Geotechnical Textiles in North East Region:


    Use of Geotextiles in infrastructure projects has led to improvement of serviceability of the infrastructure and increased maintenance intervals for infrastructure such as roads and hill slopes.

    GROWTH OF SILK PRODUCTION


    Integrated Scheme for Development of the Silk Industry


    For the development of the Indian silk industry patents have been obtained for 5 technology packages, 50 research projects have been concluded and 55 technology packages disseminated. 13885 persons have been trained under various programmes organized by the Research & Training institutes of Central Silk Board (CSB).


    The total raw silk production has increased by 11% (35,468 MT) during 2018-19 over the previous year 2017-18 (31,906 MT). The bivoltine raw silk production achieved a record production of 6,987 MT during 2018-19 by registering 18.95% growth over previous year. Raw silk yield per hectare has increased to 105 kg during 2018-19 compared to 96 kg during 2014-15


    The Textiles Ministry has taken various steps through the Central Silk Board (CSB) to protect the interest of the silk producers.


    CSB through a restructured Central Sector Scheme Silk Samagra and 38 projects under North East Region Textile Promotion Scheme (NERTPS) protects the interests of the farmers by supporting them through beneficiary oriented components like raising of kisan nursery, plantation with improved mulberry varieties, irrigation, chawki rearing centres with incubation facility, construction of rearing houses, rearing equipment and door to door service agents for disinfection. 42,026 beneficiaries have been covered. Mulberry plantation in 32,552 acres have been developed. Raw silk production in the North East region has increased from 4,602 MT in 2013-14 to 7,482 MT 2018-19 with total increase from 17% to 22% of India’s total production. It has generated employment for the tribal communities and also created sustainable livelihood for them. The positive impact of this is reflected in significant increase in Disease Free Layings (dfls) consumption, cocoon production, raw silk production besides increase in income from sericulture and its share in the total annual family income.


    Strengthened Research & Development system to improve the levels of cocoon production and productivity to develop improved mulberry/host plant varieties, silkworm hybrids and technology packages to minimize drudgery.


    For production of 3A-4A grade raw silk from the bivoltine cocoons, Automatic Reeling Machines (ARM) have been established in the country.


    Central Silk Board and State Governments mobilize additional funds for sericulture development through convergence by availing the schemes such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) being implemented by various other Ministries of Government of India.


    The basic customs duty of 10% & 20% is levied on raw silk and silk fabric import respectively. This makes the domestic silk weaving market segment stronger and also makes Indian silk export sector highly competitive.


    The Jute and Jute textile industry:


    The jute industry occupies an important place in the economy of India and is one of the major industries in the eastern region, particularly in West Bengal. Jute, the golden fibre, meets all the standards for safe packaging in view of being a natural, renewable, biodegradable and eco-friendly product. It is estimated that the jute industry provides direct employment to 0.37 million workers in organized mill and in diversified units and supports the livelihood of around 4.0 million farm families.


    Development of Jute Sector


    For the welfare of jute farmers the JUTE – ICARE (Improved Cultivation and Advanced Retting Exercise) has been launched to promote scientific practices related to Jute Cultivation for Quality & Quantity improvements. In order to facilitate modernization and up-gradation of technology in existing/ new jute mills and JDP units an incentive Scheme for Acquisition of Select Machinery (ISAPM) has been launched.


    In order to facilitate registered jute exporters for participating in foreign fairs/BSMs and Trade delegations to enhance exports of jute products an Export Market Development Assistance Scheme (EMDA) has been launched. To support jute entrepreneurs to display and promote jute diversified products through retail outlets in Metro cities, State Capitals and tourist places Retail Outlet of Jute Diversified Products and Bulk Supply Scheme has been put in place.


    In order to provide assistance to the jute mills by supporting construction cost for toilet blocks for the jute mill workers a Workers’ Welfare Scheme (Sulabh Sauchalaya) has been implemented. Incentives are being given to successful 10th & 12th class girl children of workers of Jute Mills / MSMEs in order to provide education support.


    To create new/ skilled work force for production of value added JDPs, to provide self-employment opportunity and facilitate backward and forward linkage to the existing and new entrepreneurs the Jute Integrated Development Scheme (JIDS) has been launched. To supply jute raw materials to MSMEs Units and artisans at mill gate price plus actual transportation cost the Jute Raw Material Bank (JRMB) scheme has been put in place.


    In order to promote the Indian Jute Industry, the Government has set up the Indian Jute Industries’ Research Association (IJIRA). A variety of research activities has been undertaken by IJIRA for enabling faster retting of jute plant, softening of hard root cuttings of jute and eco- friendly oil-free processing of jute.


    In the field of product development IJIRA has developed light-weight jute bag, Jute Geotextiles for construction of rural roads, Jute-thermoplastic composites and Bio-degradable laminates for jute cloth. IJIRA has also developed high-end products like jute-based air filter media, valuable chemicals from jute stick and process waste and jute-based sanitary napkins. In the field of machinery development, IJIRA has developed high-speed roller drafting machine and Continuous damping-calendaring-cutting machine.


    COMPREHENSIVE HANDLOOM DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME


    The Comprehensive Handloom Cluster Development Scheme (CHCDS) is targeted at development of Mega Handloom Clusters in clearly identifiable geographical locations covering at least 15000 handlooms with the Government of India contributing up to Rs.40 crore per cluster over a period of 5 years. Components such as conducting diagnostic study and corpus for raw material are fully funded by the Government of India whereas components like lighting units, technological up-gradation of looms and accessories are 90% funded by the Government of India. Other components such as creation of infrastructure for design studio/ marketing complex/garmenting unit, marketing development, assistance for exports and publicity are 80% funded by the Government of India.


    Eight Mega Handloom Clusters viz. Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh), Sivasagar (Assam), Virudhunagar (Tamil Nadu), Murshidabad (West Bengal), Prakasam and Guntur districts (Andhra Pradesh), Godda & neighbouring districts (Jharkhand), Bhagalpur (Bihar) and Trichy (Tamil Nadu) have been taken up for development. Under the CHCDS, around 1.75 lakh handloom weavers have been covered for which Rs. 131.91 crore has been released for various interventions during the last four financial years and the current financial year.


    Furthermore, under National Handloom Development Programme (NHDP), based on the viable proposals received from the State Governments, 294 Block Level Clusters (BLCs) have been sanctioned in the country covering around 1.6 lakh handloom weavers for which Rs. 165.99 crore has been released for various interventions during the last four financial years and the current financial year.


    Under the MUDRA scheme loans were sanctioned to 35952 weavers with a total disbursement of Rs 181.68 crore. 8611 handloom workers have been provided skill upgradation training. 7417 Hathkargha Samvardhan Sahayata (HSS) items have been distributed to 7285 beneficiaries.


    Financial Assistance of Rs 38.77 crores has been provided to 34 aspirational districts for handloom development. Hastkala Sahyog Shivirs are being organized throughout the country to spread awareness about various schemes and benefits available to the Artisans and Weavers. In order to enhance the weavers’ income, direct interface of textile companies are being developed with handloom clusters. Producer companies of handloom weavers, societies and SHGs are being formed under the Companies Act.
