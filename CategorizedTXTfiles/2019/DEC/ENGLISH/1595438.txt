    The Central GST and State GST authorities today organized a nationwide GST Stakeholder Feedback Diwas on New GST Returns for getting an on-the-spot response to the new GST Returns in 125 cities across the country where 7500+ trade associations/stakeholders participated in the programme. The new return form is to be made mandatory from 1st April 2020.


    CBIC said that the Feedback Diwas programmes are still going on at various places. The preliminary reports received with the CGST authorities are very encouraging. There has been an overwhelming response from GST stakeholders and several useful suggestions have been received. The programme was widely welcomed by GST stakeholders and tax professional/fraternity. It was significant that besides a large number of taxpayers, all prominent chambers of commerce and industry, tax practitioners & compliance managers also participated in the programmes.


    CBIC said that the CGST officers explained the new GST Returns and encouraged the participants to themselves upload these Returns (ANX-1 and ANX-2) and give feedback in regard to the ease of compliance, uploading, deficiencies and improvements, if any.
