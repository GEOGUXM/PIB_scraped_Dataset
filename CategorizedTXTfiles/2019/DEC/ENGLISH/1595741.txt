    As per information received from Society of Indian Automobile Manufactures (SIAM), there are about 30 crore vehicles plying on the road which are based on internal combustion engine.


    Department of Heavy Industry is implementing a scheme namely Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India [FAME India Scheme] with an objective to promote manufacturing and adoption of electrical vehicles (EVs).


    Under the Scheme, it is planned to support about 10 lakh e-2 Wheelers, 5 lakh e-3 Wheelers, 55000 e-4 Wheeler Passenger Cars and 7000 e-Buses through demand incentives with an outlay of Rs. 10,000 Crore for a period of 3 years commencing from 1 st April 2019.In this Scheme, the emphasis is being given on electric vehicles, used for public transport or those registered for commercial purposes in e-3W, e-4W and e-bus segment. Privately owned registered e-2W are also covered. Under the Scheme, the demand incentive is linked to battery capacity i.e. Rs. 10,000/KWh for all category of vehicles except e-buses where it is Rs. 20,000/KWh. SIAM is supporting the Scheme.


    In addition, a budget provision of Rs. 1000 crore has been made for setting up of charging infrastructure under the Scheme and Department of Heavy Industry had issued an Expression of Interest (EoI) inviting proposals for establishment of 1000 charging stations under this phase of the Scheme .


    Under Phase-I of FAME-India Scheme, the Government has supported about 500 charging stations to establish electric vehicle charging stations in the country. Out of about 500 charging stations sanctioned under Phase-I of FAME-India Scheme about 230 charging stations have been installed. Further, Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) under the Ministry of Power has deployed 65 public charging stations for EVs in the country. EESL is also deploying around 300 AC and 170 DC captive chargers across Government offices in the country.


    As per information received from EESL, the time required to charge an e-vehicle depends on the rated capacity and type of charger. DC-001 (15kW) charger takes around 70-80 minutes for complete charging (0-100%) for e-car with battery capacity of 18kWh. The unit cost of charging per unit is Rs 9.5 plus GST for public charging stations operated at NDMC, Delhi.


    This information was given by the Minister of State Heavy Industries & Public Enterprises, Arjun Ram Meghwal , in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
