    The production of all fertilizers during 2014-15 to 2018-19 are given below: -

Fertilizers Production  385.39   413.14   414.41   413.61   414.85 
                                                                   
                                                                   

    The above data shows that the production has increased during last five years, except during 2017-18, which is insignificant. Therefore, reasons for low fertilizer production does not arise.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Union Minister of Chemicals & Fertilizers, Shri. D.V.Sadananda Gowda in Rajya Sabha today.
