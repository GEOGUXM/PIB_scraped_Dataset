      Import of Palm Oil
      Posted On: 04 DEC 2019 4:56PM by PIB Delhi


    Import of edible oil is under Open General License. Import of palm oil happens mainly from ASEAN countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia under the Free Trade Agreements. Following surge in imports and threat of serious material injury to domestic industry, Government has increased Customs Duty by 5% on imports of refined bleached deodorized palmolein and palm oil into India from Malaysia for a period of 180 days from 4 th September, 2019 based on the preliminary findings of Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) under India-Malaysia CECA (Bilateral Safeguard Measures) Rules, 2017. On similar lines, Government will use all available instruments in the National interest, as and when necessary.


    This information was given by the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha today.
