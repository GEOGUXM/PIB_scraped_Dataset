     1. Benefits of the Project:


    The following potential benefits of urban parks are included:


      * Human health and wellbeing , i.e. positive impacts of parks and park use on human health (both mental and physical) and wellbeing, either through direct or indirect effects such as recreation and leisure activities.

      * Social cohesion / identity : the role of urban parks in strengthening social ties, relations and cohesion.
      * Tourism: leisure visits outside of the own living or working environment, typically longer term stays. Apart from potentially promoting the health and wellbeing of visitors, tourism is also of interest due to its contributions to the local economy.
      * Biodiversity: the role of parks in harboring and promoting biodiversity, and species diversity in particular. Biodiversity has a direct link to human wellbeing (e.g., through nature experience), while it also provides an important base for ecosystem functioning and thus a range of ecosystem services
      * Educational benefits: Parks are increasingly used as an outdoor classroom for school subjects such as environmental studies and provide valuable venues for research projects. As a result, they can help rekindle the relationship between urban residents and the natural world.
      * Environmental and Ecological Benefits : Urban green protects soils and moderates harsh urban climate for example by cooling the air, reducing wind speed and giving shade. Healthy environments lead to healthy economies and societies. Parks are pollution ameliorators and help counter the pollution. Acts as physical filters helping to reduce air pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. They also help in reducing the rate of ozone production and in capturing dusts and volatile organic compounds.

    Parks and other green spaces make important contributions to groundwater recharge and have substantially lower surface water runoff rates
