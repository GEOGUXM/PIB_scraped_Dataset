      Aadhaar-Based Technical Improvements in PDS
      Posted On: 06 DEC 2019 4:37PM by PIB Delhi


    The Department in association with all States/UTs is implementing a scheme on ‘End-to-End Computerization of PDS Operations’. The scheme includes digitization of ration cards/beneficiaries data including seeding of Aadhaar numbers and installation of ePoS (electronic Point of Sale) devices at all FPSs for bringing transparency in the distribution and ensured delivery of highly subsidised foodgrains under NFSA. State/UT wise statement showing progress of Aadhaar seeding and ePoS installation is Annexed.


    Further, Department has issued a notification under the Section-7 of the Aadhaar Act 2016 on 08/02/2017 (as amended from time to time) for the use of Aadhaar in PDS for the distribution of subsidized foodgrains to eligible beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA). The said notification issued on 08/02/2017 requires that beneficiaries under NFSA who do not possess an Aadhaar number or are not yet enrolled for Aadhaar, but are desirous of availing subsidies under NFSA, should make an application for Aadhaar enrolment by 30/06/2017; presently extended up to 31/12/2019.


    Also, in case of any areas/FPS locations with poor internet connectivity/temporary unavailability of network, which may result in failure of biometric authentication of beneficiaries, the Department has issued clear instructions to all State/UT Governments that no genuine beneficiary shall be denied for aforesaid reasons including technical failure/poor biometric of the beneficiary.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri. Danve Raosaheb Dadarao in Rajya Sabha today.
