    National Highways are being designed, constructed and maintained as per Indian Roads Congress(IRC) codes/guidelines and Ministry of Road Transport and Highways ’s specifications. Various safety measures are made as an integral part of the highway development projects depending upon the site requirement and availability of lands. The work of development and maintenance of National Highways are carried out by executing agencies viz NHAI/NHIDCL/State PWDs.
