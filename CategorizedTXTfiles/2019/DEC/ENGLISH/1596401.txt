     1. Central Sector Scheme (erstwhile Plan Scheme): This scheme is implemented predominantly in the North Eastern States. Government of India releases funds to FCI and also to the State Governments for construction of godowns. As on 31.10.2019, a total capacity of 2,33,600 MT has been completed by FCI and State Governments.


     1. Construction of Steel Silos: In addition to conventional godowns, Government of India has also approved an action plan for construction of steel silos in the country for a capacity of 100 LMT in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode for modernizing storage infrastructure and improving shelf life of stored foodgrains. Till date, location for silos with capacity of 82.75 LMT (82.50 LMT wheat and 0.25 LMT Rice) have been approved.
