      * As per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - IV (20015-16), 54.2 percent women (15-49 years) and 59.5 percent children (6-59 months) in rural area of the country are anaemic.
      * As per Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (2016-18), 19% children aged 1-4 years, 17 % children aged 5-9 years and 32% adolescents aged 10-19 years have zinc deficiency in the country.
      * The most common cause of anaemia is iron deficiency, caused by inadequate dietary iron intake or absorption, increased needs for iron during pregnancy or growth periods, and increased iron losses as a result of menstruation and helminth (intestinal worms) infestation.
      * Other important causes of anaemia include hemoglobinopathies such as Sickle Cell anemia, Thalassaemia etc, Malaria and Flurosis.
      * The State/UT-wise detail of anaemia prevalence in women and children in rural areas as per NFHS-4 is given below:

    Government is implementing various schemes in order to reduce anemia cases in the country. The details of these schemes/programmes are as below:


      * The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has launched “Anaemia Mukt Bharat” strategy for prevention and treatment of anaemia in children (6-59 months), pre- school children (5-9 years), adolescents girls and boys (10-19 years), pregnant and lactating women and in women of reproductive age group (15-49 years) in programme mode through life cycle approach via Iron & Folic Acid (IFA) supplementation across life stages.

      * Since the initiation of the strategy, various activities have been conducted. These are in the form of guidelines and dissemination, training package, supply chain management assessment, quarterly dashboard report for monitoring and review of programme coverage.
      * Universal screening of pregnant women for anaemia is a part of ante-natal care and all severely anaemic mothers are line listed and followed up for comprehensive management at higher facilities.
      * Both the Health Management Information System & Mother Child Tracking System are reporting the cases of anaemic and severely anaemic pregnant women.
      * In malaria endemic areas, to tackle the problem of anaemia due to malaria particularly in pregnant women and children, Long Lasting Insecticide Nets (LLINs) and Insecticide Treated Bed Nets (ITBNs) are being distributed.
      * Health and nutrition education through IEC & BCC to promote dietary diversification, inclusion of iron folate rich food as well as food items that promotes iron absorption.
      * Safe Motherhood Booklet is being distributed to the pregnant women for educating them on dietary diversification and promotion of consumption of IFA.
      * The details of fund sanctioned and utilized for the anaemia prevention and control programme during the last three years and current year are given below:
