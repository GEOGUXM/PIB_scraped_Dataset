    Under the scheme, the total number of fresh fellowships each year is 750. The selection of award of fellowship is based on merit and there is no State/ University-wise allocation/ ceiling on number of slots under the scheme.


    With the efforts made by the Ministry since 2017-18, number of applications has been increased and all the 750 fellowship slots are now filled up. The Ministry has started implementing the scheme directly from the year 2017-18 onwards. For this purpose a dedicated portal has been designed in the Ministry for online applications so as to ensure that fellowship amount is released to students in time directly into their accounts in DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) mode. Further, the scheme has been integrated with Public Financial Management System (PFMS) and DBT Bharat Portal.


    This information was given by Union Minister of State for Tribal Affairs Smt. Renuka Singh Saruta in a written reply in Lok Sabha today.
