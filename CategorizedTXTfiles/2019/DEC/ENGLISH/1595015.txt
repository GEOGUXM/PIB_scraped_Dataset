Thereafter, Transaction Advisor, Legal Advisor and Asset Valuer were appointed by the Government as per the procedure and mechanism laid down for this purpose. The Expression of Interest & Preliminary Information Memorandum document have been prepared by the appointed Advisors and submitted to the Government.
