    As per Military Land Register maintained by DEO Tezpur, area measuring 53.021 acres (Private-2.066+1.266) +(Sarkari-49.689) under village Kalakuchi and Bilapar, District - Baksa (earlier Nalbari district) was acquired during the year 1987, 1991 & 1996 on payment of acquisition compensation to the DC concerned.


    Further, Private land measuring 38.608 acres in District Baksa is held by the MoD under hiring. The rentals are being paid to the land owners through Civil Revenue Authority.


    As per details held, total number of civil persons killed and injured (since notification, i.e., last 53 years) of Field Firing range are as under:-


    (a) Killed — 21.


    (b) Injured — 19.


    All the above cases of death/injury have been thoroughly investigated by the Army and it has been found that in all cases that accidents resulting in death/injury are because of civilians illegally entering the range during firing, without informing police, civil administration or army units. Therefore, the civilians are not liable to claim compensation.


    All possible humanitarian assistance, however, is given by the Army to the injured/killed persons by means of first aid, shifting to the nearest hospital and assistance for conduct of last rites.


    As per Section Ten of Maneuvers, Field Firing and Artillery Practice Act, 1938, the responsibility for ensuring that no unauthorized persons enter the danger zone lies with civil administration. Being a notified field firing range, the following measures are in place & strictly ensured by the Army:


    (i) The civil administration and Police are informed about the firing schedule every Quarter (well in advance) in writing. In addition, units also intimate date and time of Firing practice to Police prior to commencement. Written intimation is also given to Gaonburahs of villages adjoining the range. Written clearances from Police Outpost at Darrangamela and Forest Range Officer, Kumarikata (Baksa District) are also obtained.


    (ii) Announcements over Mega Phone warning locals about conduct of firing are made prior to commencement. Presence of Police representative during conduct of firing is ensured.


    (iii) Notice boards (written in English, Hindi, Assamese & Bodo language) warning public against entry into the firing range, have been erected at all prominent locations around the range, Red flags are placed during firing at important places indicating the boundary of area within which firing is taking place. Sentries are posted at all road/track junctions and Entry posts to prevent unauthorized entry of civilians/domestic animals.


    (iv) No firing is permitted beyond the time intimated to the locals. No firing practices are carried out at night without intimation. All blinds/unexploded shells/ Ammunition are destroyed in-situ before vacating the range.


    No proposal has been received by DEO Tezpur regarding revival of Army Airport at Baksa.


    The total number of Army regiments existing in the country is 52.
