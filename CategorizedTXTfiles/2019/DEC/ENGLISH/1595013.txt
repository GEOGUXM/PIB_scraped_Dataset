      Posted On: 04 DEC 2019 7:15PM by PIB Delhi


    The projects of Capital procurement of defence equipment are undertaken based on threat perception, operational challenges & technological changes and to keep the Armed Forces in a state of readiness to meet the entire spectrum of security challenges. The existing Defence Production Policy aims at achieving substantive self-reliance in the design, development and production of equipment, weapon systems, platforms required for defence in as early a time frame as possible, creating conditions conducive for private industry to play an active role in this endeavour; enhancing potential of SMEs in indigenisation and broadening the defence R&D base of the country. A number of measures have been taken to promote ‘Make in India’ in defence manufacturing by harnessing the capabilities of the public & private sector such as introduction of new category of procurement ‘Buy {Indian-IDDM (Indigenously Designed, Developed and Manufactured)} and ‘Strategic Partnership Model’ in Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP); according preference to ‘Buy (Indian-IDDM)’, ‘Buy (Indian)’, ‘Buy and Make (Indian)’ & ‘Make’ categories of capital acquisition over ‘Buy (Global)’ & ‘Buy & Make (Global)’ categories; simplification of Make-II procedure, etc. As a result of the aforesaid initiatives undertaken, the Government in the last three years i.e. from 2016-17 to 2018-19 and current year till September, 2019, has accorded Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) to 130 proposals, worth Rs. 2,63,704 Crore approximately, under those categories of Capital Procurement which promote domestic manufacturing as per DPP-2016.
