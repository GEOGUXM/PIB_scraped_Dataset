    Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Nityanand Rai, in a written reply to a question regarding the construction of detention camps in Nagaland, in Rajya Sabha today, said that no such camps have been constructed. He added that while the Government of Assam had sought for re-verification of certain population under NRC in the districts bordering Bangladesh, the Supreme Court had not agreed for the same.


    Any person, not satisfied with the outcome of decisions of the claims and objections of the NRIC process may appeal before a designated Foreigners Tribunal constituted under The Foreigners (Tribunal) Order, 1964, within a period of 120 days from the date of such order, and after the disposal of appeal by the Tribunals, the names shall be included or deleted, as the case may be, in the NRIC of the State of Assam.
