    The objectives of the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) are mainly to provide good quality modern education including a strong component of culture, inculcation of values, awareness of the environment, adventure activities and physical education to the talented children predominantly from the rural areas without regard to their family's socio-economic condition. These objectives have by and large been achieved as is evident from the performance of the JNV students and demand for admission, the details of which are shown below:-

    The academic performance of students is reviewed regularly by the Academic Advisory Committee and guidance provided continuously. Individual performances are monitored at Cluster, Regional and National levels. Training facilities for teachers provided at seven locations in the country, support for preparations for competitive examinations and competency building have resulted in large number of students qualifying in admission tests conducted for various professional courses. Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) has also succeeded in connecting resources from institutes of higher learning, research institutes and universities.


    The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme provides for opening of one Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country. Opening of new JNVs is a continuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government/UT Administration to make available requisite suitable land free of cost and making available required temporary building, free of rent to run the Vidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV depends on availability of funds and approval by the competent authority. One JNV each has been sanctioned in all the districts of the country (as on 31 st May, 2014), excluding Tamil Nadu which has not yet accepted the Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme. As on date, 661 JNVs have been sanctioned all over the country, including 20 additional JNVs sanctioned in SC/ST concentrated districts, the details of which are annexed.
