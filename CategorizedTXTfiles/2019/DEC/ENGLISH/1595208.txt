      Posted On: 06 DEC 2019 1:42PM by PIB Delhi


    Public Health and hospitals being a State subject, the primary responsibility of provision of public healthcare and strengthening it to address the shortage of hospitals and doctors lies with the respective State/ UT Government. However, under National Health Mission (NHM), technical and financial support is provided to States/UTs for strengthening their healthcare systems on the basis of proposals received from States/ UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs).


    Also, shortage of doctors in public health facilities varies from State to State depending upon their policies and context. However, as per the Rural Health Statistics (RHS) 2017-18, the state-wise details of shortfall of public healthcare facilities viz, Sub Health Centres (SHCs), Primary Health Centres (PHCs) & Community Health Centres (CHCs), availability of Sub District Hospitals & District Hospitals and vacancy position of doctors at PHCs and CHCs are given below:
