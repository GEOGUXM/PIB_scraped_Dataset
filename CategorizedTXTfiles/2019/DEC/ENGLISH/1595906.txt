      Posted On: 11 DEC 2019 4:38PM by PIB Delhi


    Hill Area Development Programme (HADP) is a pilot project launched for the hill district of Tamenglong (later on divided into two districts of Tamenglong and Noney) in Manipur with an outlay of Rs.90 crore for a period of two years (2018-19 and 2019-20). Under the HADP, 40 projects worth of Rs.84.29 crore have been sanctioned for the districts of Tamenglong and Noney so far. All these projects are at their initial stage of implementation.


    As per NER District Infrastructure Index, prepared by Ministry of DoNER in 2009, districts of Tamenglong, Chandel & Churachandpur in Manipur are ranked among the lowest in NER. Constant efforts have been made to bring them at par with other districts of North Eastern Region through implementation of various schemes of the State Government and Government of India. The pilot project of HADP is indicative of the steps being taken in this regard.


    This information was provided by the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) Development of North-Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh in written reply to a question in Lok Sabha today.
