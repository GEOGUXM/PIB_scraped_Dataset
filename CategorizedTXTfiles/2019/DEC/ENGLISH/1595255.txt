    As per information provided by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), State/UT-wise cases reported against children in conflict with law (CCL) and number of CCL apprehended under Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Special & Local Laws (SLL) Crimes (IPC+SLL) during 2013-2017 is at Annexure-I . Latest data pertains to the year 2017. State/UT-wise number of under trials under 16-18 years of age group in jails as on 31.12.2017 is at Annexure-II .


    As per Section 2 (13) of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act), “child in conflict with law” means a child who is alleged or found to have committed an offence and who has not completed eighteen years of age on the date of commission of such offence”. Section 53 of the Act prescribes various rehabilitation and reintegration services to be provided in institutions for children. These include: basic requirements such as food and shelter; appropriate education including supplementary education; skill development, recreational facilities, mental health interventions, etc. Under Section 8 and 30 of the Act, the Juvenile Justice Board and Child Welfare Committee are required to conduct at least one inspection visit every month and every fortnight respectively of residential facilities for children in conflict with law and recommend action for improvement in quality of services to the District Child Protection Unit and the State Government. Further the State Governments have to appoint Inspection Committees, under section 54 of the Act, to assess the basic facilities and infrastructure of the Institution to ascertain whether the Institution is maintaining their standards as prescribed as per section 53 of the Act and as provided under the Rules 29 -38 of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules, 2016 framed under JJ Act, relating to physical infrastructure, clothing/bedding/toiletries, sanitation & hygiene, Nutrition and Diet scale, Medical care, mental health, Education, Vocational training, Recreational facilities etc. Further, under Section 41 of the Act, registration of institutions including Homes for children in conflict with law has been made mandatory with penalty in case of non-compliance. The Ministry has been requesting the State Governments/UT Administrations from time to time to identify and register all CCIs under relevant provisions of JJ Act and set up functional inspection and other Committees to ensure that children in all the CCIs receive the best of care, and are not subjected to any kind of abuse and neglect. The primary responsibility of implementation of the Act lies with the State Governments/ UT Administrations concerned.


    The Ministry of Women and Child Development is also implementing a centrally sponsored Child Protection Services (CPS) Scheme (erstwhile Integrated Child Protection Scheme) for supporting the children in difficult circumstances.The primary responsibility of implementation of the scheme lies with the State Governments/UT Administrations. Under the provisions of the CPS, Central Government is providing financial assistance to the States/UTs for undertaking a situational analysis of children in difficult circumstances. Under the scheme institutional care to Children in Need of Care and Protection (CNCP) and Children in Conflict with Law (CCL) is provided in Child Care Institutions (CCIs) as a rehabilitative measure.
