    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind has greeted fellow citizens on the eve of Christmas.


    In a message the President said, “On the joyous occasion of Christmas, I extend my greetings to all my fellow citizens in India and abroad, especially to my Christian brothers and sisters.


    We celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ whose life has been an inspiration to the humanity to follow the message of love, compassion and fraternity. Today, when the world finds itself tormented by strife, hatred and violence, his words and deeds have the power to heal wounds and show the way out.
