      Posted On: 04 DEC 2019 7:16PM by PIB Delhi


    Ministry of Defence has already put in place a system whereby information of illegal encroachments on defence land is received periodically and action taken thereon is monitored.


    As on 31.12.2018, 9622.807 acres of defence land has been reported to be encroached in the country. The Government has taken the following steps to check encroachments:

      * Respective user Services who manage defence land are responsible for its protection, removal of encroachments and planning for its land use.
      * Strengthening of Defence land management by way of computerisation and digitisation of land records; Survey, demarcation and verification of defence lands and land Audit.
      * Regular inspection of sites under respective jurisdiction is conducted by the CEO/DEO/Station Commander as the case may be.
      * Issue of detailed instructions by the Government emphasising the need for ensuring vigilance, detection and prevention of new encroachments.
      * Removal of encroachments on defence land under the provisions of Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971 as well as under the Cantonment Act, 2006.

    No defence land is unused/surplus. All defence land is being utilised for bonafide military purposes only and for strategic, operational and security needs of the nation. Certain land which appears to be lying unused is meant for training, mobilisation practice, construction of Key Location Plans (KLP) and Married Accommodation.


    This information was given by Raksha Rajya Mantri Shri Shripad Naik in a written reply to Shri Dr Sujay Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and Shri Dhairyasheel Sambhajirao Mane in Lok Sabha today.
