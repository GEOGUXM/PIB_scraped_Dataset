    Under National Health Mission, the Government of India is implementing following interventions to address pneumonia:


      * SAANS (Social Awareness and Actions to Neutralize Pneumonia Successfully) Initiative to accelerate action to reduce deaths due to Childhood Pneumonia. The SAANS initiative encompasses a three tiered strategy: i) National Childhood Pneumonia Management Guidelines on treatment and management of Childhood Pneumonia; ii) Skill building and training of service providers for identification and standardized management of Pneumonia; and iii) a 360 0 communication SAANS Campaign to ensure greater awareness on childhood Pneumonia among families and parents in order to trigger behaviour change and improve care seeking.

      * Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) focuses on Measles, Haemophilus Influenzae (B) and Pneumococcal Vaccine for prevention of pneumonia.
      * Early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding for first six months and appropriate Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices are promoted under Mothers’ Absolute Affection (MAA) initiative.

    Facility based Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness (F-IMNCI) training to build capacity of Medical Officer and Nurses in PrimaryHealth Centres, First Referral Unit, Community Health Centres, and District Hospital on Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) Management.
