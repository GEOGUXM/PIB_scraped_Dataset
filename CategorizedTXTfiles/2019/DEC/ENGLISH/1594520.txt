      Committee for Corporatisation of Ordnance Factory Board
      Posted On: 02 DEC 2019 4:56PM by PIB Delhi


    During the past two decades, several High Level Committees like TKA Nair Committee, Vijay Kelkar Committee & Raman Puri Committee have inter-alia recommended that Ordnance Factories should be converted from a Government Department into a Corporate entity.


    The OFB is an attached office of Department of Defence Production, Govt. of India. There is no plan at present for strategic tie-up between private sector and Ordnance Factory Board (OFB).


    In respect of non-core items, OFB can still participate in RFPs of the users, i.e. Armed Forces on competitive basis. Decision to declare items as non-core was taken in consultation with all the stake holders and was done to enable OFB to focus on core areas and complex systems like artillery guns, tanks, ammunitions etc. The above position has been adequately explained to the employees of OFB through various meetings in the Ministry. Further, in order to ensure smooth transition from non-core to core areas for production, re-training of workers of non-core factories has also commenced to enable them to work in the core areas.


    This information was given by Raksha Rajya Mantri Shri Shripad Naik in a written reply to Shri Vaiko in Rajya Sabha today.
