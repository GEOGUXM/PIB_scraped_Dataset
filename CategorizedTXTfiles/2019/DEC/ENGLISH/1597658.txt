    Figure-1: Monthly Crude Oil Production


    Unit-wise production details with reasons for shortfall are as under:


         1. Crude oil production by ONGC during November, 2019 was 1673.22 TMT which is 7.33% lower than the target and 1.89% lower when compared with November, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by ONGC during April-November, 2019 was 13638.33 TMT, which is 3.79% and 3.60% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively.


      * ESP issues in wells of NBP and Ratna R-series fields.

      * Increase in water cut in certain wells of Mumbai High, Heera, Neelam and B-173A fields.
      * Sub-sea leakage in some well fluid lines of MH Asset leading to flow restriction.
      * Power shut downs & electrical faults in Mehsana.
      * Decline in pressure & increase in water-cut in Kesanapalli West field in Rajahmundry and Lakwa field in Assam.

         1. Crude oil production by OIL during November, 2019 was 260.17 TMT which is 7.20% lower than monthly target and 4.67% lower when compared with November, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by OIL during April-November, 2019 was 2147.00 TMT which is 5.19% and 4.22% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Major reasons for lower production is less than planned contribution from workover wells and drilling wells.


         1. Crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during November, 2019 was 680.90 TMT which is 12.39% lower than the monthly target and 15.13% lower than November, 2018. Cumulative crude oil production by Pvt/JVs during April-November, 2019 was 5939.43 TMT which is 8.92% and 11.18% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * RJ-ON-90/1-MANGLA (CEIL): Delay in making 45 FM-1/4 infill wells on line. Lag in liquidating the inventory of planned work overs and production optimization jobs. ESP failure in some wells.

      * Operational issues in Bhagyam, Aishwarya and ABH fields. (CEIL)
      * CB-ONN-2005/9 (Mercator): Oil production from Jyoti-1 is stopped. Well closed for long term pressure build up study and could not be put back in production due to non-grant of EC for development campaign.

    Natural Gas

     1. Natural gas production during November, 2019 was 2563.41 MMSCM which is 6.57% lower than the monthly target and 6.16% lower when compared with November, 2018. Cumulative natural gas production during April-November, 2019 was 21209.55 MMSCM which is 6.40% and 2.64% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Unit-wise and state-wise natural gas production is given at Annexure-II . Unit-wise natural gas production for the month of November, 2019 and cumulatively for the period April-November, 2019 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-2 and month-wise in Figure-2.

    Figure-2: Monthly Natural Gas Production


         1. Natural gas production by ONGC during November, 2019 was 1893.85 MMSCM which is 6.71% lower than target and 9.45% lower when compared with November 2018. Cumulative natural gas production by ONGC during April-November, 2019 was 15919.90 MMSCM which is 4.96% and 1.85% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively.


      * Partial Shutdown of VA (Vashistha) & S1 plant for maintenance Job in Eastern Offshore.

      * Less gas off take by OTPC, Tripura.
      * Less offtake by gas consumers in Cauvery & Rajahmundry Assets and no gas off-take in Jodhpur & Silchar Assets.
         1. Natural gas production by OIL during November, 2019 was 228.20 MMSCM which is 0.58% higher than the production of corresponding month of last year but lower by 16.81% monthly target. Cumulative natural gas production by OIL during April-November, 2019 was 1851.81 MMSCM which is 1.29% higher than the production during the corresponding period of last year but 5.80% lower than the cumulative target. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:

      * Environmental loss (Bandh and miscreant activities).

      * Less offtake by M/s. BVFCL due to major repeated unscheduled maintenance issue.

         1. Natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during November, 2019 was 441.36 MMSCM which is 0.47% higher than monthly target and 6.74% higher than November, 2018. Cumulative natural gas production by Pvt/JVs during April-November, 2019 was 3437.85 MMSCM which is 5.80% and 7.99% lower than target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall in production are as under:


      * RJ-ON/6: Production is lower due to less offtake by consumers. Production also lower due to zone pressure depletions in some wells, water ingress and tubing damage. (FEL)

      * Sohagpur West: Dewatering wells gas breakout awaited, slow gas ramp up in pilot wells and scaling in producing wells. (RIL)

     1. Refinery Production (in terms of crude oil processed)

    Refinery production during November, 2019 was 21900.62 TMT which is 11.17% higher than the target for the month and 3.75% higher when compared with November, 2018. Cumulative production during April-November, 2019 was 169555.04 TMT which is 0.93% higher than the target for the period but 1.22% lower than production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Unit-wise production is given at Annexure-III . Company-wise production for the month of November, 2019 and cumulatively for the period April-November, 2019 vis-à-vis same period of last year has been shown in Table-3 and month-wise in Figure-3.

         1. CPSE Refineries’ production during November, 2019 was 12572.54 TMT which is 11.88% higher than the target for the month but 0.62% lower when compared with November, 2018. Cumulative production by CPSE refineries during April-November, 2019 was 96230.25 TMT which is 0.63% higher than target for the period but 4.14% lower than production during corresponding period of last year respectively. Reasons for shortfall of refinery production in some CPSE refineries are as under:


      * IOCL, Mathura and Paradip: Lower due to deferment of shutdown.

      * IOCL, Panipat: Lower than plan due to high due to high DHDT and SKO feedstock.
      * BPCL, Kochi: Lower due to operational issues.
      * HPCL, Visakh: Lower due to primary unit shutdown.
      * CPCL, Manali: Lower due to raw diesel containment because of increase in duration of DHDT M&I and revamp shutdown.
      * NRL, Numaligarh & MRPL, Mangalore: Lower due to HSD ullage constraint.

    3.2 Production in JV refineries during November, 2019 was 1730.29 TMT which is 12.50% higher when compared with the production of November, 2019 and 12.87% higher than the target for the month. Cumulative production by JVs refineries during April-November, 2019 was 13141.41 TMT which is 5.09% and 15.16 higher than the target for the period and production during corresponding period of last year.


    3.3 Production in private refineries during November, 2019 was 7597.78 TMT which is 9.73% lower than the target as well as corresponding month of last year. Cumulative production by private refineries during April-November, 2019 was 60183.37 TMT which is 0.55% higher than the target as well as corresponding period of last year.


    3.4 Refinery-wise details of the capacity utilization and production of petroleum products during the month of November, 2019 and cumulatively for the period April-November, 2019 vis-à-vis April-November, 2018 are given at Annexures - IV and V respectively.
