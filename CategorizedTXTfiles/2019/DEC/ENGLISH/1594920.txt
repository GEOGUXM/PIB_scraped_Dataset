    Government notified the National Manufacturing Policy(NMP) in 2011. The Policy is based on the principle of industrial growth in partnership with the States. National Investment & Manufacturing Zones (NIMZs) are one of the important instruments of the policy. Government has already granted final approval to the NIMZ in Sangareddy district, Telangana. Further, the proposal for granting final approval of establishment of Hyderabad Pharma City NIMZ in Rangareddy district, Telangana has been considered and recommended by the High Level Committee (HLC).


    A letter of Chief Minister of Telangana was received in which CM has requested to release an amount of Rs. 500 Crores for development of external and internal infrastructure under Phase-1 of Zaheerabad NIMZ in Sangareddy district of Telangana.

For development of infrastructure in the NIMZ, the role of DPIIT is limited to coordination and no finances from DPIIT are committed for this purpose. The project proposals need to be prepared by the State Government and processed for approval as per norms and procedures applicable to Central Sector/ Centrally Sponsored/State Sector schemes/projects. DPIIT will forward such requisitions to the concerned Ministries and coordinate between State Government and line Ministries.
