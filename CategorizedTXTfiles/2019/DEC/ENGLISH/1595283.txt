      Posted On: 06 DEC 2019 4:39PM by PIB Delhi


    With a view to evacuate surplus sugar from the country, mill-wise Minimum Indicative Export Quotas (MIEQ) of 50 LMT of sugar for export in the 2018-19 sugar season (October, 2018 to September, 2019) was fixed and sugar mills were advised to export sugar as per their MIEQ allocation. Against allocation of 50 LMT of sugar for export, about 37 LMT of sugar has been exported in sugar season 2018-19. No compulsion was made on sugar mills by the Government to export sugar from the country and sugar mills were free to export sugar as per their commercial decision.


    In view of huge carryover stock of sugar and estimates of surplus production of sugar than the estimated consumption in the current sugar season 2019-20, the Government has allocated mill-wise Maximum Admissible Export Quantity (MAEQ) of 60 LMT of sugar amongst sugar mills for export in the sugar season 2019-20.


    This information was given in a written reply by the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Shri. Danve Raosaheb Dadarao in Rajya Sabha today.
