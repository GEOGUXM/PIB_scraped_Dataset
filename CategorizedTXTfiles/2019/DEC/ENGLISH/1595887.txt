In this direction, efforts have been made to promote steel usage by inserting new GFR rules 136(i)(iii) to consider life cycle cost analysis in Government projects for steel intensive structures, holding workshops, collaborative branding campaigns namely ‘Ispati-Irada’, push for Capital Goods manufacturing in the country and Steel Clusters near the steel plants. Also, Government’s ‘Make-in-India’ initiative for manufacturing sector and schemes for building & construction sector such as Rural and Urban Housing Schemes, and infrastructure development sector provided impetus to the demand and consumption of steel in the country. The per capita consumption of steel has increased from 57.6 kg. to 74.1 kg during the last five years. Further, Government’s plan of an investment of Rs. 100 lakh crore for infrastructure development in the next five years will boost the demand and per capita steel consumption in the country.
