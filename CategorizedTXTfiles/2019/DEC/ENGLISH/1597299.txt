    High Impact 100-day initiatives


    From across these initiatives, 4 key elements had been prioritized by the Ministry of Steel under the 100 days agenda of the Government. A brief summary of progress on these initiatives is as follows:


     1. Framework policy on creation of steel clusters - Aimed at encouraging the MSMEs in the steel sector, this would boost production of value-added products, drive import substitution and help create additional employment in the steel sector.A draft policy for the same has been prepared and uploaded online for stakeholder consultation. A cabinet note is being prepared and the policy shall be notified post cabinet approval.

     2. Steel scrap policy - To ensure adequate availability of scrap for steel manufacturers which will reduce imports and improve competitiveness of Indian steel sector. Steel Scrap policy has been notified on 7 th November 2019 with roles and responsibilities for players (aggregators, processing centres) & government bodies (E.g. MoEFCC, CPCB) defined.
     3. Safety guidelines for Iron and Steel sector - Ministry of Steel had constituted a working group to develop the Model guidelines of safety practices for iron and steel sector. This shall ensure that safe practices are adopted in all manufacturing units, large and small, of iron & steel. It shall ensure a healthy working environment and guard against possible hazards and risks at the workplace.25 safety guidelines have been finalized and uploaded on the Ministry of Steel website for adoption by the iron and steel sector.
     4. Steel Import Monitoring System (SIMS) - An institutional mechanism in conjunction with DGFT has been envisioned for steel import monitoring. This would be a completely online system for advance registration for intended imports of steel. This information would be useful to the Indian domestic steel industry in responding to market conditions in a dynamic manner.SIMS platform has been launched on 16th September 2019 and implementation has already started at the port of entry from 1st November 2019.

    In addition to these 4 initiatives, the Ministry of Steel has also worked on 6 other key initiatives. These initiatives include:

     1. Raw Material Securitization - To ensure short-term and long-term raw material security for the steel sector, the Ministry of Steel has worked closely with the Ministry of Mines to initiate several key actions.

    Five proposals for amendments in the relevant mining rules have been sent to the Ministry of Mines. Some of the major proposals include:

          + Rule 3 of Mineral (Mining of Govt. Companies Rule) 2015 – Word “may” would be replaced with “shall” to remove uncertainty
          + Reduction in royalty proposed from 15% to 5% to dispose low grade fines to incentivize pelletization and beneficiation
          + Liquidation of 70 MT iron ore fines (including slime) at SAIL
          + Increasing the size of mining lease areas
     1. Digitization of mines in steel CPSEs - To improve the operational and cost efficiencies as well as to increase the transparency in the mining sector, digitization is being driven across the Steel CPSEs.Detailed roadmap has been put in place to kick-start the digitization journey for the iron ore mining sector in the country for improvements in utilization, productivity and safety. The project will involve 2 phases with involvement from key Central Public Sector Enterprises. Identification and institutionalization of digital lighthouse project by NMDC to identify and streamline operating modalities has been initiated.
     2. Noamundi block initiative - Social indicators of the Noamundi Block in the West Singhbhum (Chaibasa) District, Jharkhand are not reflective of richness of area in terms of natural resources (iron ore). Large organizations like SAIL, Tata Steel etc. have significant experience that can be leveraged for social transformation in the region. Core team has been set up under the leadership of Deputy Commissioner, West Singhbhum with representatives from SAIL, Tata Steel and Ministry of Steel. This program focuses on collaboration and convergence of efforts, resources, technology and thereby enabling people to participate in economy and governance.
     3. Outreach to workforce of Steel CPSEs - People are the key drivers of success for most organizations. This is even more prominent in an employment intensive sector like steel. Therefore, they need to be the focus of the organization and their issues need to be taken care of.For this, multiple actions have been initiated at the steel CPSEs. At SAIL, pension scheme is being implemented and process for Wage Revision, 2017 of Non-executives and 3 rd PRC for executives will be implemented.
     4. Synergising steel CPSEs’ hospitals with Ayushman Bharat - Ayushman Bharat Yojana was launched in 2018 as the national health protection scheme by providing coverage of 5 lakh rupees per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization. SAIL maintains 3000+ beds in its hospitals for employees, families and others.These SAIL hospitals will be linked with the Ayushman Bharat Yojana to leverage existing synergies. Process of empanelment of these hospitals with Ayuhsman Bharat Yojana will be completed.
     5. Promotion of Steel Usage - In order to leverage the several benefits afforded by steel and to transition to an environmentally sustainable steel sector, it is crucial to promote steel usage in the country. Multiple initiatives have already been initiated for enhancing the domestic steel demand. These include:
          + Draft note of Committee of Secretaries (CoS) sent for inter-ministerial consultation. Under this note, multiple proposals for addition/modifications of steel based construction codes and necessary clauses in tender documents have been included to improve steel usage. Additionally, initiatives to increase steel usage in road and bridge construction have also been included.
          + Collaborative branding campaign of ‘ Ispati Irada’ launched with logo, portal and communication by national level brand ambassador P.V. Sindhu.
          + Letters sent to various Central Ministries/ Departments to improve usage of steel in Government projects.
          + Requests sent to State Governments for increasing usage of steel intensive/composite structures in building and bridge construction projects and for putting up steel crash barriers.

    Interactions held with INSDAG, SAIL-CET, MECON, HSCL, ISA, architects, builders, and contractors for increased steel usage in commercial and residential construction.

    1.3 Share of different routes of production in India


    This growth in capacity has been enabled by a vibrant growth across all three routes of production (BOF, EAF and IF) ensuring the Indian steel industry remains extremely diverse. One of the key factors for India’s strong growth rate in crude steel capacity has been the exceptional growth rate in the electrical route of steel making (EAF and IF), which accounted for 56% of the crude steel production in 2018-19.

    1.5 India’s robust steel input industries


    India’s strong growth in crude steel and finished steel production has been supported and enabled by vibrant sponge iron (especially for electrical routes of steel making) and pig iron industries which serve as crucial inputs for the steel industry.


    India has been the world’s leading producer of sponge iron since 2003, with a host of coal-based units located in the mineral rich states of the country. Over the years, the coal-based route has emerged as a key contributor and accounted for 80% of total sponge iron production in the country in 2018-19. Capacity in sponge iron making has also increased over the years and stood at 46.56 MT in 2018-19.

    India is also an important producer of pig iron. Post liberalization, with setting up several units in the private sector, not only have imports drastically reduced, but India has also turned into a net exporter of pig iron. The private sector has accounted for 91% of total production of pig iron in the country in 2018-19.

    1.6 India’s finished steel production and net export/import scenario


    India’s rising demand and strong growth in crude steel capacity has led to India’s finished steel production (alloy/stainless + non-alloy) witnessing a 6% CAGR over the past 5 years. Apart from catering to a robust domestic demand, the Indian steel industry is a global exporter as well and has reduced its import requirements from 9.32 MT to 7.83 MT over the past 5 years. India was a net exporter in 2016-17 and 2017-18, however returned to being a net importer in 2018-19. India has been a net exporter of finished steel in FY20.

    Going forward, the Government's vision to achieve a $5 trillion economy by 2024 entails investments in several steel intensive sectors like Housing for all, 100% electrification, piped water for all etc. The growth potential for the sector is thus immense and the domestic steel consumption will increase significantly in line with this vision. It is therefore important to ensure that this demand is served through a robust domestic steel industry . The National Steel Policy 2017 laid out a set of key imperatives to create a globally competitive steel sector.

     1. National Steel Policy 2017

    The National Steel Policy (NSP) was approved by the Ministry of Steel and notified on 8 th May, 2017 to ensure that the Indian steel sector is prepared to service the growing requirements of modern India and to promote a healthy sustainable growth for the sector. The NSP was defined with the vision “to create a technologically advanced and globally competitive steel industry that promotes economic growth”. The policy outlined key objectives for the steel sector and laid down multiple initiatives for the industry.


    Key features of the NSP 2017 include establishing self-sufficiency in steel production by providing policy support & guidance to private manufacturers, MSME steel producers and CPSEs. It encourages capacity additions, development of globally competitive steel manufacturing capabilities as well as cost-efficient production by facilitating domestic availability of iron ore, coking coal & natural gas, as well as overseas asset acquisitions of raw materials. To support the sector, it also promotes initiatives to enhance the domestic steel demand.


    The policy projects crude steel capacity of 300 million tonnes (MT), production of 255 MT and a robust finished steel per capita consumption of 160 Kg by 2030-31, as against the current consumption of 74 Kg. The policy also envisages 100% indigenous fulfilment of demand for high grade automotive steel, electrical steel, special steels and alloys for strategic applications along with an increase in domestic availability of washed coking coal so as to reduce import dependence on coking coal from about 85% to around 65% by 2030-31.


    To action the initiatives mentioned as part of the National Steel Policy, a strategic roadmap is being created by the Ministry of Steel.


    Development of a strategic roadmap


    The National Steel Policy 2017 outlines a variety of challenges faced by the industry and potential solutions which the Ministry of Steel should action. It defined 106 initiatives for the steel sector across 15 different areas:
