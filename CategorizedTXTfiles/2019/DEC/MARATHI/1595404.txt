      Posted On: 07 DEC 2019 2:44PM by PIB Mumbai


    As per the initiative of the Finance Minister to obtain direct feedback on the New GST Return System, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has conducted ‘ Stakeholders Feedback Divas’ on new GST Return System, in CGST Zone, Mumbai December 7, 2019. The New Return System is planned to be rolled out with effect from April 1, 2020.


    CGST Mumbai Zone has organized the Stakeholder Feedback Divas under the leadership of Chief Commissioner CGST, Ms. Sungita Sharma, at sixteen locations covering Mumbai City, Suburban area, Navi Mumbai and also far-flung places such as Boisar and Vasai, thereby covering a tax base of around 3 lakh assessees. The Chief Commissioner personally visited the locations to interact with the taxpayers and departmental officers to assess the success of the outreach programme.


    This step is in line with Government’s policy to make the tax administration more tax payer friendly and make tax returns simple and transparent.


    All eleven Tax Payer Services Commissionerates of the zone conducted workshops, facilitating direct interaction of chartered accountants, tax practitioners and tax payers with departmental officers. Special facilities were made in every Commissionerate to provide 10-15 computers and laptops, for real-time hands-on experience.


    This interactive exercise has given first-hand experience to the participants and has also helped the department to gather valuable feedback, which would further improve and make the New Return System more user-friendly.


    This initiative has been whole-heartedly welcomed by the trade and industry.
