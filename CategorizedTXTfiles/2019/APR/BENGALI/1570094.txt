    National Maritime Day was observed today, in commemoration of the maiden voyage into international waters of S.S. Loyalty, India’s first merchant vessel from Mumbai to London on 05 April 1919. It marked a red letter day in the maritime and navigation history of India, a country known for its sea-faring abilities since ancient days. Senior officers of the Indian Navy and state govt paid tributes to the sailors who had sacrificed their lives at sea, by placing wreaths at the Lascar War Memorial in presence of all ranks of INS Netaji Subhas.


    The Lascar War Memorial is an iconic structure built in honour of 896 Lascars, who sacrificed their lives fighting for the Royal Navy in the World War I. The war memorial is maintained by Indian Navy.


    National Maritime Day was first celebrated on 05 April 1964. The principal objective of celebrating the day is to enable all Indians know more intimately about the rich maritime heritage of our nation and the importance of a strong maritime capability to build & safeguard the economy of the country. This year marks the centenary of maiden voyage of the first Indian flagged vessel, the theme being “Indian Ocean – An Ocean of Opportunity”.
