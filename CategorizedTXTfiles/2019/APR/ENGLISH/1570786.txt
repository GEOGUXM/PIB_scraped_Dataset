      The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind in his message on the eve of Mahavir Jayanti has said: -


      “On the auspicious occasion of Mahavir Jayanti, I extend my greetings and best wishes to all fellow citizens, especially to the Jain community.


      Lord Mahavira’s message of peace and non-violence has enriched our cultural heritage. When the world is facing multiple challenges, the philosophy and teachings of ahimsa, truth and compassion enunciated by Bhagwan Mahavira hold great significance.


      Let us on this auspicious day resolve to ceaselessly strive for harmony in our country and across the world.”
