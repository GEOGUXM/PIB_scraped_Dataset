      Yesterday’s c yclonic storm ‘FANI’ (pronounced as ‘ FONI ’) over southeast Bay of Bengal (BoB) & neighbourhood moved north-northwestwards during past 24 hours and lay centred at 0830 hrs IST of today, the 29 th April 2019 near latitude 8.7°N and longitude 86.9°E over the same region about 620 km east of Trincomalee (Sri Lanka), 870 km east-southeast of Chennai (Tamil Nadu) and 1040 km south-southeast of Machilipatnam (Andhra Pradesh).


      It is very likely to intensify into a s evere cyclonic storm during next 06 hours and into a v ery severe cyclonic storm during subsequent 24 hours. It is very likely to move northwestwards till 01st May evening and thereafter recurve north-northeastwards gradually.


      Forecast track and intensity are given in the following table:
