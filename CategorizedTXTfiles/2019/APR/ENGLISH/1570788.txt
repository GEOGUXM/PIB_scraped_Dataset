      Posted On: 16 APR 2019 5:09PM by PIB Delhi


    A major catastrophe was averted by the well trained Indian Naval aircrew, when their Chetak helicopter ditched at sea last week.


    The helicopter was integral to an Indian Naval Warship operationally deployed in the Arabian Sea.


    As per reports, the helicopter developed technical failure prior ditching and the crew displayed immense professional prowess and sound training thereby deftly landing the helicopter in the water and successfully egressing from it.


    While all three crew members are safe, a Board of Inquiry has been ordered to investigate the cause of the technical failure leading to the loss of the helicopter
