      Posted On: 17 APR 2019 11:07AM by PIB Delhi


    The 11 member ‘Himalayan Heights Motorcycle Expedition’ which was flagged off from Karu (Leh) on 07 April 2019 traversed the challenging terrain of Eastern Ladakh, across the Chang La pass and has reached the mighty ‘Karakoram Pass’ situated at an altitude of 18,176 feet on the Karakoram Ranges on 16 April 2019. The joint Motorcycle Expedition which comprises six Indian Army personnel from the Army Service Corps, four from Royal Enfield and one from Himalayan Motorsports Association is being undertaken in the year when the Fire & Fury Corps is celebrating 20th Anniversary of Kargil Vijay Diwas, which marks the victory of the Indian Armed Forces over Pakistan in 1999.


    This unprecedented feat over hazardous and unforgiving terrain with temperatures as low as -40C coupled with freezing winds, is a remarkable tribute to the immortal courage and bravery of the Indian Army. In a rare gesture of encouragement for the expedition members, Lt Gen YK Joshi, General Officer Commanding, Fire and Fury Corps reached the Karakoram Pass to meet and motivate the riders.​​


    Speaking on the occasion, Lt Gen YK Joshi lauded the efforts of the team especially the two Women Officers from the Army Service Corps and the woman member of the Royal Enfield team who proved equal in strength, skill and spirit to the other members.


    The Ladakh region was witness to the unparalleled valour, indomitable courage and immortal tales of sacrifice during the Kargil War in 1999. The Himalayan Heights Expedition undertaken by the Army Service Corps, Royal Enfield and Himalayan Motorsports Association demands similar attributes and is a salute to ‘Remember, Rejoice & Renew’ the spirit of fortitude, bravery and adventure of the Indian Army.
