    The President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind has greeted fellow-citizens on the eve of birthday of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar.


    In a message, the President has said, “On the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti, commemorating the birthday of Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, the Chief Architect of the Constitution of India, I extend my greetings and felicitations to all fellow citizens.


    Dr. Ambedkar was an outstanding leader of our freedom struggle and a staunch crusader for the rights of the downtrodden and traditionally disadvantaged sections of our society. A scholar, educationist, legal luminary, social reformer and political leader, Dr. Ambedkar’s philosophy and life are an inspirational profile of courage and conviction.


    Dr. Ambedkar envisioned a society where the weaker sections, the historically deprived, peasants, labourers, and especially women, get equal rights and respect. He was an ardent advocate of resolving all issues through democratic, peaceful, non-violent and harmonious means.
    The path shown by him strengthens the spirit of fraternity, compassion and equity.


    On this day, let us take a pledge to learn from Dr. Ambedkar’s life and thoughts, and follow his teachings.”
