While States like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan have larger number of service voters, Uttarakhand has also got around 88,600 services voters. Garhwal parliamentary constituency has maximum number of service voter among all the five constituencies of the State, since 2004 till date.This figure becomes significant, considering the population of the State.The increase in number of service voters has been due to Election Commissionâ€™s all out efforts to maximise the registration of service electors during summary revision 2019 and active cooperation of the services/departments concerned and greater participation of service personnel.
